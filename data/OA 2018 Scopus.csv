These behaviors are typically characterized using either optical, atomic force, confocal, or electron microscopy; however, most microscopic techniques are generally restricted to observing what's happening on the ""top"" side or even the interior of the cell. Our group has focused on engineered surfaces typically reserved for microelectronics as potential surfaces to control cell behavior. These devices allow the exploration of novel substrates including titanium, tungsten, and tantalum intermixed with silicon oxide. Furthermore, these devices allow the exploration of the intricate patterning of surface materials and surface geometries i.e., trenches. Here we present two important advancements in our research: (1) the ability to split a fixed cell through the nucleus using an inexpensive three-point bend micro-cleaving technique and image 3D nanometer scale cellular components using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy; and (2) the observation of nanometer projections from the underbelly of a cell as it sits on top of patterned trenches on our devices. This application of a 3-point cleaving technique to visualize the underbelly of the cell is allowing a new understanding of how cells descend into surface cavities and is providing a new insight on cell migration mechanisms. © 2018 by the authors.",Adhesion; Cross-sectioning; Mammalian cells; Morphology; Nanoscale; Tantalum,Adhesion; Cells; Mammals; Microelectronics; Morphology; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicon compounds; Silicon oxides; Tantalum; Tantalum compounds; Titanium oxides; Cellular components; Cross-sectioning; Engineered surfaces; High-resolution scanning electron microscopies; Mammalian cells; Microscopic techniques; Nano scale; Potential surfaces; Cytology,,MDPI AG,19961944,,,,English,Mater.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059342354,

A serious unbalance of traffic flow in the network can speed up pavement deterioration of highways with heavy traffic, which influences the sustainability of pavement performance and increases maintenance expenditures. The purpose of this research is to obtain a more optimized traffic assignment for pavement damage reduction by establishing a multi-objective DTA model with the objectives of not only minimum travel time but minimum decline of Present Serviceability Index (PSI) for pavements. Then, teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is utilized to solve the proposed model. Results of a case study indicate that a more balanced traffic flow assignment can be realized by the model, which can effectively reduce average PSI loss, save maintenance expenditures, extend pavement service life span, save fuel consumption and reduce pollutant emissions in spite of a little increase of average travel time. Additionally, sensitivity of weight factor for the two objective functions is analyzed. This research provides some insights on methods on sustainable pavement performance. © 2018 by the authors.",DTA model; Fuel consumption; Maintenance expenditures; Pavement service life span; Pollutant emissions; PSI; Sustainability of pavement performance; TLBO; Travel time,algorithm; expenditure; fuel consumption; index method; maintenance; model; pavement; pollution; road; sustainability; traffic management; travel time,,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059351604,

The Fracture Risk Scale (FRS) was designed for fracture risk assessment in LTC, to optimize targeting of services in those at highest risk. This study aims to examine the construct validity and discriminative properties of the FRS in three Canadian provinces at 1-year follow up. Methods: LTC residents were included if they were: 1) Adults admitted to LTC homes in Ontario (ON), British Columbia (BC) and Manitoba (MB) Canada; and 2) Received a Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set Version 2.0. After admission to LTC, one-year hip fracture risk was evaluated for all the included residents using the FRS (an eight-level risk scale, level 8 represents the highest fracture risk). Multiple logistic regressions were used to determine the differences in incident hip or all clinical fractures across the provinces and FRS risk levels. We examined the differences in incident hip or all clinical fracture for each FRS level across the three provinces (adjusted for age, BMI, gender, fallers and previous fractures). We used the C-statistic to assess the discriminative properties of the FRS for each province. Results: Descriptive statistics on the LTC populations in ON (n = 29,848), BC (n = 3129), and MB (n = 2293) are: mean (SD) age 82 (10), 83 (10), and 84 (9), gender (female %) 66, 64, and 70% respectively. The incident hip fractures and all clinical fractures for FRS risk level were similar among the three provinces and ranged from 0.5 to 19.2% and 1 to 19.2% respectively. The overall discriminative properties of the FRS were similar between ON (C-statistic = 0.673), BC (C-statistic = 0.644) and MB (C-statistic = 0.649) samples. Conclusion: FRS is a valid tool for identifying LTC residents at different risk levels for hip or all clinical fractures in three provinces. Having a fracture risk assessment tool that is tailored to the LTC context and embedded within the routine clinical assessment may have significant implications for policy, service delivery and care planning, and may improve care for LTC residents across Canada. © 2018 The Author(s).",Hip fracture; InterRAI prediction; Long term care; Mortality; Nursing home,,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712318,,,30587140,English,BMC Geriatr.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059246347,

Enhancement of longwave radiation beneath coniferous forests has been found to impact the surface energy balance and rates of snowmelt. Although the skill of model-simulated snowmelt has been shown to be lower for forests than for open areas, model intercomparisons and evaluations of model parameterizations have not yet focused on longwave enhancement. This study uses stand-scale forcing for the simulation of subcanopy longwave radiation by Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) and to drive SNOWPACK, a snow model featuring more complex canopy structure, as a benchmark model for CLM4.5. Simulated subcanopy longwave radiation and longwave enhancement are assessed using measurements from forest stands located within perennially snow-covered regions. These forest stands, of varying canopy density, cover the range of boreal plant functional types in CLM4.5. CLM4.5 is found to overestimate the diurnal range of subcanopy longwave radiation and longwave enhancement, and simulation errors increase with decreasing cloudiness and increasing vegetation density. Implementation of a parameterization of heat storage by biomass reduces simulation errors but only marginally affects the amplitude of diurnal ranges. These results reaffirm previous findings that simulation of subcanopy longwave radiation can be improved by partitioning the vegetation canopy into two layers. Moreover, this study reveals the variations of simulation errors across meteorological conditions and vegetation density, the latter of which is the most important parameter for longwave enhancement independent of vegetation type. ©2018.

The proposed control scheme is experimentally validated in the presence of real-world uncertainties in quadrotor system parameters and sensor measurement. The designed control scheme guarantees asymptotic stability of the close-loop system with the help of complete controllability of the attitude dynamics in applying optimal control signals. To achieve robustness against parametric uncertainties, the optimal tracking solution is combined with an online least squares based parameter identification scheme to estimate the instantaneous inertia of the quadrotor. Sensor measurement noises are also taken into account for the on-board Inertia Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. To improve controller performance in the presence of sensor measurement noises, two sensor fusion techniques are employed, one based on Kalman filtering and the other based on complementary filtering. The ALQT controller performance is compared for the use of these two sensor fusion techniques, and it is concluded that the Kalman filter based approach provides less mean-square estimation error, better attitude estimation, and better attitude control performance.",adaptive linear quadratic tracking; indirect estimation; Kalman filter; least squares estimation; quadrotor UAV; sensor fusion,,,NLM (Medline),14248220,,,30583553,English,Sensors (Basel),Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058922118,

PROSPECT, the Precision Reactor Oscillation and Spectrum Experiment, consists of a segmented 4 ton Li6-doped liquid scintillator detector covering a baseline range of 7-9 m from the reactor and operating under less than 1 m water equivalent overburden. Data collected during 33 live days of reactor operation at a nominal power of 85 MW yield a detection of 25 461±283 (stat) inverse beta decays. Observation of reactor antineutrinos can be achieved in PROSPECT at 5? statistical significance within 2 h of on-surface reactor-on data taking. A reactor model independent analysis of the inverse beta decay prompt energy spectrum as a function of baseline constrains significant portions of the previously allowed sterile neutrino oscillation parameter space at 95% confidence level and disfavors the best fit of the reactor antineutrino anomaly at 2.2? confidence level. © 2018 authors.

Little research, however, has examined the effect of patients using eHealth tools to self-report their medication management and use. Similarly, there is little evidence showing how eHealth tools might prompt patients and health care providers to make appropriate changes to medication use. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to determine the impact of patients' use of eHealth tools on self-reporting adverse effects and symptoms that promote changes to medication use. Related secondary outcomes were also evaluated. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched from January 1, 2000, to April 25, 2018. Reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and included articles from the literature search were also screened to identify relevant studies. Title, abstract, and full-text review as well as data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by 2 reviewers. Due to high heterogeneity, results were not meta-analyzed and instead presented as a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies, including 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 1 open-label intervention, were included, from which 11 unique eHealth tools were identified. In addition, 14 RCTs found statistically significant increases in positive medication changes as a result of using eHealth tools, as did the single open-label study. Moreover, 8 RCTs found improvement in patient symptoms following eHealth tool use, especially in adolescent asthma patients. Furthermore, 3 RCTs showed that eHealth tools might improve patient self-efficacy and self-management of chronic disease. Little or no evidence was found to support the effectiveness of eHealth tools at improving medication recommendations and reconciliation by clinicians, medication-use behavior, health service utilization, adverse effects, quality of life, or patient satisfaction. eHealth tools with multifaceted functionalities and those allowing direct patient-provider communication may be more effective at improving patient self-management and self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that the use of eHealth tools may improve patient symptoms and lead to medication changes. Patients generally found eHealth tools useful in improving communication with health care providers. Moreover, health-related outcomes among frequent eHealth tool users improved in comparison with individuals who did not use eHealth tools frequently. Implementation issues such as poor patient engagement and poor clinician workflow integration were identified. More high-quality research is needed to explore how eHealth tools can be used to effectively manage use of medications to improve medication management and patient outcomes. ©Karla Lancaster, Aseel Abuzour, Manmeet Khaira, Annalise Mathers, April Chan, Vivian Bui, Annie Lok, Lehana Thabane, Lisa Dolovich.

The quasi-static response showed symmetric behavior for the samples tested along RD and 45° whereas the ED samples manifested completely asymmetric behavior. Although the ED samples exhibited longer fatigue lives than the RD and 45° in the high cycle fatigue, the fatigue lives in the low cycle fatigue regime were similar. The texture measurement indicated a sharp basal texture along ED, explaining its asymmetric behavior. Higher tensile mean stress and less dissipated plastic energy per cycle for the ED samples, acting as two competing factors, were the principal reasons for exhibiting fatigue responses identical to those of RD and 45° in the LCF regime. The fracture surface in the ED direction was dominated by twin lamellae and profuse twinned grains, whereas that in RD was dominated by slip bands. Finally, Smith-Watson-Topper and Jahed-Varvani models were employed to predict the fatigue lives along all directions using a single set of material parameters. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Anisotropy; Asymmetry; Characterization; Fatigue modeling; Texture; ZK60 extrusion,Anisotropy; Characterization; Extrusion; Tensile strength; Textures; Asymmetric behaviors; Asymmetry; Fatigue model; Material parameter; Quasi static response; Smith-watson-topper; Strain controlled fatigue; Texture measurement; Fatigue of materials,,Elsevier Ltd,2641275,,,,English,Mater.

Within the selected process window, the results obtained from X-ray computed tomography analysis indicate that the relative density of as-built samples increases with an increase in laser power. In addition, it is observed that irregular-shaped pores with the longest axis normal to the building direction are significantly reduced with increasing the laser power. Microstructural investigation suggests that with increasing the laser power, a transformation from conduction to transition and keyhole modes occurs. In X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-built samples, only fcc ?-phase is detected and no reflection of bcc ?-phase is found. Texture measurements show that the intensity of ?110? crystallographic orientation along the building direction of the as-built samples increases with increasing laser power. Coefficient of thermal expansion of the as-built samples is very low and comparable to that of conventionally manufactured Invar alloy. Furthermore, as-built samples fabricated at lowest (250 W) and highest (400 W) laser powers exhibit the lowest and highest thermal expansion displacement, respectively. Finally, the thermal expansion behavior and its correlation with structural integrity and texture are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Invar alloy; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure; Porosity; Thermal expansion,Computerized tomography; Fabrication; Gamma rays; Laser optics; Microstructure; Porosity; Crystallographic orientations; Invar alloy; Laser powders; Microstructural investigation; Relative density; Texture measurement; Thermal expansion behavior; X-ray computed tomography; Thermal expansion,,Elsevier Ltd,2641275,,,,English,Mater.

However, their caring responsibilities often affect their psychological wellbeing and ability to continue in their role. It is of paramount importance to easily identify caregivers that would benefit from immediate assistance. Methods: In this nonexperimental cohort study, a cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 362 informal caregivers (mean age 64.1 years, SD ± 13.1) caring for persons with high care needs (mean age 78.6 years, SD ± 15.0). Caregivers were interviewed using an interRAI-based self-reported survey with 82 items covering characteristics of caregivers including key aspects of wellbeing. A factor analysis identified items in the caregiver survey dealing with subjective wellbeing that were compared against other wellbeing measures. A screener, called Caregiver Wellbeing Index (CWBI), consisting of four items with response scores ranging from 0 to 2 was created. The CWBI was validated in a follow-up study in which 1020 screeners were completed by informal caregivers of home care clients. Clinical assessments of the care recipients (n = 262) and information on long-term care home (LTCH) admission (n = 176) were linked to the screener dataset. The association between the CWBI scores and caregiver and care recipient characteristics were assessed using logistic regression models and chi-square tests. The reliability of CWBI was also measured. Results: The CWBI scores ranging from zero to eight were split in four 'wellbeing' levels (excellent, good, fair, poor). In the validation study, fair/poor psychological wellbeing was strongly associated with caregiver reports of inability to continue in their role; conflict with family; or feelings of distress, anger, or depression (P < 0.0001). Caregivers caring for a care recipient that presented changes in behavior, cognition, and mood were more likely to present fair/poor wellbeing (P < 0.0001). Additionally, caregivers with high CWBI scores (poor wellbeing) were also more likely to provide care for someone who was admitted to a LTCH (OR 3.52, CI 1.32-9.34) after controlling for care recipient and caregiver characteristics. The Cronbach alpha value 0.89 indicated high reliability. Conclusion: The CWBI is a valid screener that can easily identify caregivers that might benefit from further assessment and interventions. © 2018 The Author(s).",Carer; Home care; interRAI; Long-term care home; Screener,,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712318,,,30545318,English,BMC Geriatr.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058535102,

Recently, there has been an increasing effort to deterministically integrate single semiconductor quantum dots into complex photonic circuits. Despite rapid progress in the field, it remains challenging to manipulate the optical properties of waveguide-integrated quantum emitters in a deterministic, reversible, and nonintrusive manner. Here we demonstrate a new class of hybrid quantum photonic circuits combining III-V semiconductors, silicon nitride, and piezoelectric crystals.

This work provides the first quantitative assessment of the role of compensation between uncertainties in aerosol forcing and atmospheric parameters, and their impact on the climate sensitivity of the Community Atmosphere Model, Version 4 (CAM4). Running the model with prescribed ocean and ice conditions, we perturb four parameters related to sulfate and black carbon aerosol radiative forcing and distribution, as well as five atmospheric parameters related to clouds, convection, and radiative flux. In this experimental setup where aerosols do not affect the properties of clouds, the atmospheric parameters explain the majority of variance in climate sensitivity, with two parameters being the most important: one controlling low cloud amount, and one controlling the timescale for deep convection. Although the aerosol parameters strongly affect aerosol optical depth, their impacts on climate sensitivity are substantially weaker than the impacts of the atmospheric parameters, but this result may depend on whether aerosol-cloud interactions are simulated. Based on comparisons to inter-model spread of other ESMs, we conclude that structural uncertainties in this configuration of CAM4 likely contribute 3 times more to uncertainty in climate sensitivity than parametric uncertainties. We provide several parameter sets that could provide plausible (measured by a skill score) configurations of CAM4, but with different sulfate aerosol radiative forcing, black carbon radiative forcing, and climate sensitivity. © Author(s) 2018.",,aerosol; atmospheric modeling; black carbon; parameter estimation; radiative forcing; uncertainty analysis,,Copernicus GmbH,16807316,,,,English,Atmos.

The rationale for embedding sustainability from the beginning of implementation is well recognized; however, strategies to sustain and spread successful initiatives are less clearly described. The aim of this study is to identify strategies used by hospital staff and management to sustain and spread successful nutrition care improvements in Canadian hospitals. Methods: The More-2-Eat project used participatory action research to improve nutrition care practices. Five hospital units in four Canadian provinces had one year to improve the detection, treatment, and monitoring of malnourished patients. Each hospital had a champion and interdisciplinary site implementation team to drive changes. After the year (2016) of implementing new practices, site visits were completed at each hospital to conduct key informant interviews (n = 45), small group discussions (4 groups; n = 10), and focus groups (FG) (11 FG; n = 71) (total n = 126) with staff and management to identify enablers and barriers to implementing and sustaining the initiative. A year after project completion (early 2018) another round of interviews (n = 12) were conducted to further understand sustaining and spreading the initiative to other units or hospitals. Verbatim transcription was completed for interviews. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts, FG notes, and context memos was completed. Results: After implementation, sites described a culture change with respect to nutrition care, where new activities were viewed as the expected norm and best practice. Strategies to sustain changes included: maintaining the new routine; building intrinsic motivation; continuing to collect and report data; and engaging new staff and management. Strategies to spread included: being responsive to opportunities; considering local context and readiness; and making it easy to spread. Strategies that supported both sustaining and spreading included: being and staying visible; and maintaining roles and supporting new champions. Conclusions: The More-2-Eat project led to a culture of nutrition care that encouraged lasting positive impact on patient care. Strategies to spread and sustain these improvements are summarized in the Sustain and Spread Framework, which has potential for use in other settings and implementation initiatives.

In communities where country foods (locally harvested foods: land animals, fish, birds, plants) are integrated in the daily diet, as is the case in remote northern regions where food security is a challenge, such foods can potentially be a significant route of contaminant exposure. To assess this issue, a biomonitoring project was implemented among Dene/Métis communities of the Dehcho region of the Northwest Territories, Canada. Methods: Participants completed dietary surveys (i.e., a food frequency questionnaire and 24-h recall) to estimate food consumption patterns as well as a Health Messages Survey to evaluate the awareness and perception of contaminants and consumption notices. Biological sampling of hair, urine and blood was conducted. Toxic metals (e.g., mercury, lead, cadmium), essential metals (e.g., copper, nickel, zinc), fatty acids, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were measured in samples. Results: The levels of contaminants in blood, hair and urine for the majority of participants were below the available guidance values for mercury, cadmium, lead and uranium. However, from the 279 participants, approximately 2% were invited to provide follow up samples, mainly for elevated mercury level. Also, at the population level, blood lead (GM: 11 ?g/L) and blood cadmium (GM: 0.53 ?g/L) were slightly above the Canadian Health Measures Survey data. Therefore, although country foods occasionally contain elevated levels of particular contaminants, human exposures to these metals remained similar to those seen in the Canadian general population. In addition, dietary data showed the importance and diversity of country foods across participating communities, with the consumption of an average of 5.1% of total calories from wild-harvested country foods. Conclusion: This project completed in the Mackenzie Valley of the Northwest Territories fills a data gap across other biomonitoring studies in Canada as it integrates community results, will support stakeholders in the development of public health strategies, and will inform environmental health issue prioritization. © 2018 The Author(s).",Biomarker; Biomonitoring; Dene; Exposure; First nations; Metals; North; Risk assessment; Traditional foods,,,BioMed Central Ltd.,7787367,,APHEE,,English,Arch.

The tourism sector has likewise pledged to reduce its GHG emissions (?70% by 2050); however, current emission trends would result in a tripling in the same timeframe. In order to understand how the sector understands the decarbonisation challenge, 17 senior tourism leaders were interviewed with regard to their perspectives on the risks and opportunities associated with climate change impacts and action. Respondents affirmed that the climate is already changing, fuelled by human activities, including tourism, and that its impacts on society and tourism will be largely negative and devastating in some regions. Opinion was divided regarding mitigation timelines, the compatibility of continued tourism growth with Paris Climate Agreement decarbonisation goals, and the role of technology and governance in reducing emissions. The paper examines leaders perspectives in terms of belief systems that interpret information in decision-making, as well as forms of agnogenesis; this is, the fabrication of uncertainty to justify non-action. Belief systems and agnogenesis are thought to represent important barriers to progress on the decarbonisation of tourism, as they are for the global low-carbon transition. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This article investigates the development of LOS for 32 destinations in developed and emerging economies as well as Small Islands and Developing States (SIDS). The analysis is based on UNWTO data for 478.5 million international tourist arrivals, or about 40% of the global total in 2015, for the years 19952015. Results show considerable differences in LOS between destinations, with a global trend of falling LOS, by 14.8% over the study period. However, in individual destination countries, LOS was found to be increasing. Analyses of LOS trends reveal that these can neither be explained by distancedecay relationships nor business to leisure arrival ratios.

The interaction suppresses quantum coherence and forces the system towards a steady state. Such dissipative processes are captured by the paradigmatic spin-boson model, describing a two-state particle, the ""spin"", interacting with an environment formed by harmonic oscillators. A fundamental question to date is to what extent intense coherent driving impacts a strongly dissipative system. Here we investigate experimentally and theoretically a superconducting qubit strongly coupled to an electromagnetic environment and subjected to a coherent drive. This setup realizes the driven Ohmic spin-boson model. We show that the drive reinforces environmental suppression of quantum coherence, and that a coherent-to-incoherent transition can be achieved by tuning the drive amplitude. An out-of-equilibrium detailed balance relation is demonstrated. These results advance fundamental understanding of open quantum systems and bear potential for the design of entangled light-matter states. © 2018 The Author(s).",,amplitude; electromagnetic method; experimental study; numerical model; quantitative analysis; superconductivity; theoretical study; acceleration; Article; boson; comparative study; controlled study; electromagnetism; energy transfer; mathematical parameters; molecular probe; particle size; proton transport; quantum mechanics; steady state; superconductivity,,Nature Publishing Group,20411723,,,29643365,English,Nat.

Novel design and mechanisms to encapsulate lithium polysulfides are greatly desired by high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries towards practical applications. Herein, we report a strategy of utilizing anthraquinone, a natural abundant organic molecule, to suppress dissolution and diffusion of polysulfides species through redox reactions during cycling. The keto groups of anthraquinone play a critical role in forming strong Lewis acid-based chemical bonding. This mechanism leads to a long cycling stability of sulfur-based electrodes. With a high sulfur content of ?73%, a low capacity decay of 0.019% per cycle for 300 cycles and retention of 81.7% over 500 cycles at 0.5 C rate can be achieved.

Notwithstanding these recommendations, the use of RCTs in the evaluation of BSPs has been resisted by (almost) all. Policy makers and managers are correct in their reluctance to undertake RCT-based evaluations for four reasons. First, while RCTs require the random allocation of support, judicious programmes select firms on the basis of potential and amenability to support. Second, while RCTs require treatments that exhibit low variability, the most effective BSPs draw upon substantive knowledge to provide support that is customised. Third, BSPs aim to produce outliersfirms whose performance is exceptional. When outliers are present, very large samples will be required to produce reliable results. Finally, an RCT may not yield a meaningful contribution to knowledge. The strength of an RCT is its ability to estimate the magnitude of the treatment effect under controlled conditions. But where much depends on the nature of participants and circumstances, we seek evidence of what works, for whom, in which circumstances, and why. © 2018, The Author(s).",,,,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,20551045,,,,English,Palgrave Commun.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064908724,

This article presents research that used re/insurance catastrophe models to estimate the influence of climate change on flood-related losses. The geographic focus of the study was the Canadian Maritimesspecifically Halifax, Nova Scotiaand it sought to determine how municipal risks due to rainfall-driven riverine floods could change as a result of climate change. Results: Findings show that annual flood losses could increase by up to 300% under a business-as-usual climate scenario by the end of the century (i.e., no mitigation or adaptation), even without accounting for changes to the built environment that could increase exposure (e.g., no population or economic growth). Conclusions: Increasing flood risk demands an open discussion about how much risk is acceptable to the community and what controls on further growth of exposure are necessary. Moreover, projected increases in flood losses put into question long-term insurability in the Halifax area, and highlight a broader problem facing manyother areas in Canada as well. © 2018, The Author(s).",Catastrophe losses; Climate change; Flood; Insurance; Public policy; Risk management,,,Springer,21978670,,,,English,Geoenvironmental Disasters,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060300944,

While much has been written about historical Confucian ideas about tributary relations, IPE scholars have devoted little attention to another Chinese intellectual tradition that challenged those ideas in the 19th century: Chinese economic nationalism. In the wake of the two Opium Wars, early Chinese economic nationalist thinkers urged Chinese authorities to embrace a new priority of boosting the country's wealth and power (fuqiang) through an outward-oriented, state-led development strategy. Their ideas shared some similarities with Listian economic nationalism that became popular elsewhere in the world at this time, but they were developed without direct engagement with that Westernoriginated thought. The indigenous roots of 19th-century Chinese economic nationalism also gave it characteristics that distinguished it in interesting ways from the Western version of economic nationalism in that era. In addition to widening our understandings of Chinese traditions of IPE thought, this study of the distinct content and origins of early Chinese economic nationalism contributes to: recent efforts to overcome the Western-centric foundations of IPE thought, literature exploring the diversity of economic nationalist thought and its diffusion in the 19th century, and analyses of China's post-1978 foreign economic policy. © The Author(s) 2018.

The low density of magnesium alloys and their high specific strength relative to steel and aluminum alloys make them promising candidates for automotive light-weighting but standard phenomenological plasticity models cannot adequately capture the complex plastic response of these materials. In this study, the constitutive plastic behavior of a rare-earth magnesium alloy sheet, ZEK100 (O-temper), was considered at room temperature, under quasi-static conditions. The CPB06 yield criterion for hcp materials was employed along with a non-associative flow rule in which the yield function and plastic potential were calibrated for a range of plastic deformation levels to account for evolving anisotropy under proportional loading. The non-associative flow rule has not previously been applied to magnesium alloys which require the use of flexible constitutive models to capture the severe anisotropy and its evolution with plastic deformation. The non-associative flow rule can provide the required flexibility by decoupling the yield function and plastic potential. For the associative flow rule, such flexibility can only be achieved by multiple linear transformations of the stress tensor resulting in expensive models for calibration and simulations. The constitutive model was implemented as a user material subroutine (UMAT) within the commercial finite element software, LS-DYNA, for general 3-D stress states along with an interpolation technique to consider the evolution of anisotropy based upon the plastic work. To evaluate the accuracy of the implemented model, predictions of a single-element model were compared with the experimental results in terms of flow stresses and plastic flow directions under various proportional loading conditions and along different test directions. Finally, to assess the predictive capabilities of the model, full-scale simulations of coupon-level formability experiments were performed and compared with experimental results in terms of far-field load-displacement and local strain paths. Using these experiments, the constitutive model was evaluated across the full range of representative stress states for sheet metal forming operations. It was shown that the predictions of the model were in very good agreement with experimental data. © 2018 by the authors.

Models that are built to analyze land-use change can help us understand the causes and effects of change, which can provide support and evidence to land-use planning and land-use policies to eliminate or alleviate potential negative outcomes. A variety of modelling approaches have been developed and implemented to represent land-use change, in which statistical methods are often used in the classification of land use as well as to test hypotheses about the significance of potential drivers of land-use change. The utility of statistical models is found in the ease of their implementation and application as well as their ability to provide a general representation of land-use change given a limited amount of time, resources, and data. Despite the use of many different statistical methods for modelling land-use change, comparison among more than two statistical methods is rare and an evaluation of the performance of a combination of different statistical methods with the same dataset is lacking. The presented research fills this gap in land-use modelling literature using four statistical methods-Markov chain, logistic regression, generalized additive models and survival analysis-to quantify their ability to represent land-use change. The four methods were compared across three dimensions: accuracy (overall and by land-use type), sample size, and spatial independence via conventional and spatial cross-validation. Our results show that the generalized additive model outperformed the other three models in terms of overall accuracy and was the best for modelling most land-use changes with both conventional and spatial cross-validation regardless of sample size. Logistic regression and survival analysis were more accurate for specific land-use types, and Markov chain was able to represent those changes that could not be modeled by other approaches due to sample size restrictions. Spatial cross-validation accuracies were slightly lower than the conventional cross-validation accuracies.

The amino acids investigated were chosen based on their differences in side chain polarity and potential impact on this surface affinity. While calcium pre-saturation of the calcium-deficient ns-nHA was not found to improve attachment of any of the amino acids studied, the polarity and fraction of ionized functional side groups was found to have a significant impact on this attachment. Overall, amino acid attachment to ns-nHA was not solely reliant on carboxyl groups. In fact, it seems that amine groups also notably interacted with the negative ns-nHA surface and increased the degree of surface binding achieved. As a result, glycine and lysine had greater attachment to ns-nHA than aspartic acid under the reaction conditions studied. Lastly, our results suggest that a layer of each amino acid forms at the surface of ns-nHA, with aspartic acid attachment the most stable and its surface coverage the least of the three amino acids studied. © 2018, The Author(s).",,,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,,English,Sci.

Consequently, numerous strains of rhizobia possess the ability to decrease plant ethylene levels by the expression of the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase or via the production of rhizobitoxine, thus, leading to an increased ability to nodulate leguminous plants. Nevertheless, not much is understood about the prevalence of these ethylene modulation genes in different rhizobial groups nor their role in the evolution of the symbiotic process. In this work, we analyze the prevalence and evolution of the enzymes ACC deaminase (AcdS) and dihydrorhizobitoxine desaturase (RtxC) in 395 NodC+ genomes from different rhizobial strains isolated from a wide range of locations and plant hosts, and discuss their importance in the evolution of the symbiotic process. The obtained results show that AcdS and RtxC are differentially prevalent in rhizobial groups, indicating the existence of several selection mechanisms governed by the rhizobial strain itself and its evolutionary origin, the environment, and, importantly, the leguminous plant host (co-evolution). Moreover, it was found that the prevalence of AcdS and RtxC is increased in Bradyrhizobium and Paraburkholderia, and lower in other groups. Data obtained from phylogenetic, evolutionary as well as gene localization analysis support the previous hypotheses regarding the ancient origin of the nodulation abilities in Bradyrhizobium and Paraburkholderia, and brings a new perspective for the importance of ethylene modulation genes in the development of the symbiotic process. The acquisition of AcdS by horizontal gene transfer and a positive selection in other rhizobial groups indicates that this enzyme plays an important role in the nodulation process of many rhizobia. On the other hand, RtxC is negatively selected in most symbioses. Understanding the evolution of ethylene modulation genes in rhizobia may be the key to the development of new strategies aiming for an increased nodulation and nitrogen fixation process. © 2018",Biotechnology; Ecology; Evolution; Microbiology; Plant biology,,,Elsevier Ltd,24058440,,,,English,Heliyon,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058685193,

There are many reasons for this, centered around substantial obstacles in developing clinically useful metabolomic biomarkers. Most significant is the need for interdisciplinary teams with expertise in metabolomics, analysis of complex clinical and metabolomic data, and clinical care. Importantly, the clinical need must precede biomarker discovery, and the experimental design for discovery and validation must reflect the purpose of the biomarker. Standard operating procedures for procuring and handling samples must be developed from the beginning, to ensure experimental integrity. Assay design is another challenge, as there is not much precedent informing this. Another obstacle is that it is not yet clear how to protect any intellectual property related to metabolomic biomarkers. Viewing a metabolomic biomarker as a natural phenomenon would inhibit patent protection and potentially stifle commercial interest. However, demonstrating that a metabolomic biomarker is actually a derivative of a natural phenomenon that requires innovation would enhance investment in this field. Finally, effective knowledge translation strategies must be implemented, which will require engagement with end users (clinicians and lab physicians), patient advocate groups, policy makers, and payer organizations. Addressing each of these issues comprises the framework for introducing a metabolomic biomarker to practice. © 2018 by the authors.",Biomarkers; Knowledge translation; Metabolomics,,,MDPI AG,22181989,,,,English,Metabolites,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054748093,

However, the connection between female politicians and population health warrants more significant attention. This study takes advantage of differences among Canadian provinces to evaluate the effect of women in government on age-standardized all-cause mortality rates, to assess the potential mediating role of government spending, and to determine the role played by political partisanship. Time-series cross-sectional data are retrieved from the Canadian Socio-Economic Information Management System II Tables for 19762009 (10 provinces and 34 years = 340 cases). Cumulative women in government is measured as the cumulative seats held by female politicians as a percentage of provincial seats since 1960. Political partisanship is measured as the cumulative seats held by female politicians in left-wing, centre, and right-wing parties as a percentage of provincial seats since 1960. Government spending is measured as the average of standard scores of four provincial expenditures: medical care, preventive care, other social services, and post-secondary education. Health is measured as total, male and female age-standardized mortality rates per 1000 population (all causes of death). Estimation techniques include the Prais-Winsten regressions with panel-corrected SEs, a first-order autocorrelation correction model, and fixed-unit effects, adjusted for alternative factors. We find that as the cumulative average percentage of women in government has historically risen, total, male, and female mortality rates tend to be lower, net of alternative explanations. Government spending partially mediates the effect of women in government on mortality rates. Moreover, increases in female politicians from left-wing, centre, and right-wing parties are all significantly associated with decreases in mortality rates. Women in government can bring about desirable changes in population health. Our work encourages more debate and research about quotas and other measures designed to level the political playing field for women. © 2018 The Authors",,adult; all cause mortality; article; education; female; government; human; information system; major clinical study; male; medical care; mortality rate; population health; public figure; social work; time series analysis; wing,,Elsevier Ltd,23528273,,,,English,SSM Popul.

The pixelated unit cell is basically a dual-band resonator loaded with two resistors which model the input impedance of a power combining circuit in a complete harvesting system. To design the unit cell, a topology optimization approach based on pixelization of the surface of the unit cell and application of a binary optimization algorithm is used. The optimization goal is set to maximize harvesting efficiency at 2.45 GHz and 6 GHz. In our design, full symmetry of the unit cell is considered to achieve insensitivity to the polarization of the incident wave. Once, the unit cell is designed, as a proof of the concept, a metasurface harvester composed of 9 × 9 pixelated cells is designed. The full-wave electromagnetic simulation results demonstrate that the proposed metasurface absorbs the incident electromagnetic wave energy with nearly unity efficiency at both frequencies of interest and irrespective the polarization of the incident field while simultaneously delivering the absorbed power to the loads. To validate the simulations, the metasurface harvester is fabricated and tested in an anechoic chamber.

Huntington disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. A spectrum of PTMs have been shown to modify the normal functions of HTT, including proteolysis, phosphorylation and lipidation, but the full contribution of these PTMs to the molecular pathogenesis of HD remains unclear. In this study, we examine all commonly occurring missense mutations in HTT to identify potential human modifiers of HTT PTMs relevant to HD biology. We reveal a SNP that modifies post-Translational myristoylation of HTT, resulting in downstream alterations to toxic HTT proteolysis in human cells. This is the first SNP shown to functionally modify a PTM in HD and the first validated genetic modifier of post-Translational myristoylation.

Briefly, mixed mode SPME fibers were inserted into the muscle for 20 min extraction, and then the fibers were desorbed in an optimal mixture of solvents. The obtained lipid profile was then compared and contrasted to that obtained with employment of ex vivo SPME and solid-liquid extraction (SLE) from fish muscle tissue belonging to the same group of fish, following a one-year storage period. Ex vivo SPME analysis of stored muscle samples revealed 10-fold decrease in the number of detected molecular features in comparison to in vivo study. Moreover, in vivo microsampling enabled the identification of different classes of bioactive lipids, including fatty acyls, not present in the lipid profile obtained through ex vivo SPME and SLE, suggesting the alterations occurring in the unbound lipid fraction of the system under study during the storage and also indicating the advantage of the in vivo extraction approach. © 2018 The Author(s).",,,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,,English,Sci.

A subset of HIV surveillance data in Canada with detailed and compatible variables is pooled for statistical analysis. The study population is Men having Sex with Men (MSM) in Canada from the pooled data. Estimated parameters regarding the HIV epidemic in the study population show that, across age strata, the number of new infections is distributed differently from the number of people living with HIV. A nonlinear programming algorithm is developed regarding which strata should be considered for repeated testing. Among strata in which repeated testing is considered, the optimal frequency of testing is calculated by stratum to minimize the expected number of tests per year. Scenarios and options that all fulfil the UNAIDS vision are presented. In addition to minimizing the expected number of tests per year, other considerations are also examined such as annual testing in selected strata and the tolerance to imperfect implementation of the testing program with low coverage or uptake rates. © 2018",,,,Elsevier B.V.,22116923,,,,English,Oper.

Many different applications exist for displaying a given electronic document, and users rightfully assume that documents will be rendered similarly independently of the application used. However, this is not always the case, and these inconsistencies, regardless of their causesbugs in the application or the file itselfcan become critical sources of miscommunication. In this paper, we present a study on the correctness of PDF documents and readers. We start by manually investigating a large number of real-world PDF documents to understand the frequency and characteristics of cross-reader inconsistencies, and find that such inconsistencies are common13.5% PDF files are inconsistently rendered by at least one popular reader. We then propose an approach to detect and localize the source of such inconsistencies automatically. We evaluate our automatic approach on a large corpus of over 230 K documents using 11 popular readers and our experiments have detected 30 unique bugs in these readers and files. We also reported 33 bugs, some of which have already been confirmed or fixed by developers. © 2018, The Author(s).",Cross-software inconsistencies; Document correctness; Error-message clustering; Image comparison,Rendering (computer graphics); Automatic approaches; Bank statements; Cross-software inconsistencies; Document correctness; Electronic document; Error messages; Image comparison; Large corpora; Program debugging,,Springer New York LLC,13823256,,ESENF,,English,Empir Software Eng,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043364555,

For instance, over-fishing of parrotfish - an important grazer of macroalgae that can prevent destructive overgrowth of macroalgae - has threatened reef ecosystems in recent decades and stimulated conservation efforts such as the formation of marine protected areas. Here we develop a mathematical model of coupled socio-ecological interactions between reef dynamics and conservation opinion dynamics to better understand how natural and human factors interact individually and in combination to determine coral reef cover. We find that the coupling opinion and reef systems generates complex dynamics that are difficult to anticipate without use of a model. For instance, instead of converging to a stable state of constant coral cover and conservationist opinion, the system can oscillate between low and high live coral cover as human opinion oscillates in a boom-bust cycle between complacency and concern. Out of various possible parameter manipulations, we also find that raising awareness of coral reef endangerment best avoids counter-productive nonlinear feedbacks and always increases and stabilizes live coral reef cover. In conclusion, an improved understanding of coupled opinion-reef dynamics under anthrogenic stressors is possible using coupled socio-ecological models, and such models should be further researched. © 2018 The Author(s).",,article; awareness; Caribbean; coral reef; human,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,29416056,English,Sci.

A mosaic ecosystem is one consisting of adjacent, coexisting patches of highly distinct naturally occurring land states (in this case, shola forest and natural grassland). Changes in the landscape since the nineteenth century have severely impacted the shola-grassland mosaic and challenged the traditional lifestyles of the indigenous Toda people. However, the responses of traditional Toda socio-ecological perspectives and landscape management to these changes have not been explored through population surveys. Here, using a survey method, the article explores traditional Toda perspectives of ecosystem value and landmanagement practices. The survey consists of interviews of 50 respondents belonging to 24 munds (villages), covering ten clans, neighbouring mosaic lands, plantations and agricultural areas. The findings show that traditional socio-ecological landscape management is robust and has persisted despite marked ecological and socio-economic changes during the nineteenth and twenty-first centuries, and despite frequent gathering of land management advice from non-Toda. Elements of traditional socio-ecological knowledge that have persisted include prevalent collective traditional decision-making and long-held preferences for a landscape composition with a strong mosaic component. The highly robust nature of Toda socio-ecological culture and land management suggests that the Todas have a valuable role to play in supporting the long-term persistence of the shola-grassland mosaic. Increasing their stewardship role would help conserve this endangered and highly biodiverse ecosystem, while at the same time preserving a unique indigenous culture. © 2018, The Author(s).",,,,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,20551045,,,,English,Palgrave Commun.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065039931,

This multi-stressor landscape for amphibian species at risk led to a collaborative stakeholder approach for habitat restoration and species recovery. The main project goal was to increase the quantity and quality of lowland wetland habitat by reconnecting known amphibian-breeding sites with constructed and/or enhanced small ponds. Long-term amphibian monitoring data were used to determine strategic locations for wetland construction and/or enhancement. Habitat enhancement outcomes (N total = 21 sites) since 2006 include 10 newly constructed ponds, enhancement of eight re-contoured ponds after historic infilling, and invasive predatory species removal at three sites. Project ponds were monitored annually (2007 to 2014) for calling frogs, the presence of eggs, and metamorphic emergence. Early signs of colonization and metamorphic success for Great Basin Spadefoot (Spea intermontana) (N = 13 sites) and Pacific treefrog (Pseudacris regilla) (N = 7 sites) populations have been observed, however no records of Blotched tiger salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium) colonization has been detected. Wetland habitat construction and enhancement have doubled the number of available fishless ponds to support breeding within the study area and engaged landowners through voluntary stewardship. Whether constructed or enhanced ponds have aided species recovery is unclear, though the colonization and successful metamorphosis of some species provides early supporting evidence that it will. © 2018 by the authors.",Agroecosystems; Amphibian; Ecological planning; Terrestrial habitat; Wetland restoration,agricultural ecosystem; amphibian; environmental restoration; monitoring; pond; terrestrial environment; wetland; British Columbia; Canada; Okanagan Valley; Ambystoma; Ambystoma tigrinum melanostictum; Amphibia; Anura; Pseudacris regilla; Spea intermontana,,MDPI AG,14242818,,,,English,Diversity,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062340207,

Safety is achieved by adding to the theory gauged vectorlike fermions and by employing recently developed large number-of-flavor techniques and results. We show that the gauge, scalar quartic and Yukawa couplings achieve an interacting ultraviolet fixed point below the Planck scale. The minimal model is a relevant example of a standard model extension in which unification of all type of couplings occurs because of a dynamical principle, i.e., the presence of an ultraviolet fixed point. This extension differs from the usual grand unified theories scenario in which only gauge couplings unify and become free with the remaining couplings left unsafe.

In this study, the impacts of charging infrastructure on the effectiveness of different EV operational modes were simulated using a multi-component modelling approach, which accounts for both stochastic EV fleet charging behaviors as well as optimal energy vector dispatch operation. Moreover, a campus microgrid case study was presented to demonstrate the various design factors and impacts of charging infrastructure implementation affecting EV fleet adoption and operation. Based on results from the study, it was shown that charging infrastructure should be adopted in excess of the minimum required to satisfy EV charging for driving needs. In addressing uncontrolled charging behaviors, additional charging infrastructure improves EV owner convenience and reduces queuing duration. Meanwhile, controlled charging strategies benefit from increased resilience against uncertain charging behavior and operate more optimally in systems subject to time-of-use (TOU) electricity pricing. Lastly, it was demonstrated that successful vehicle-to-grid (V2G) implementation requires charging infrastructure to emulate the availability and fast response characteristics of stationary energy storage systems, which translates to excess charging port availability, long EV plug-in durations, and bi-directional power flow capabilities well beyond the level 2 charging standard. © 2018 by the authors.",Controlled charging; Electric vehicle; Optimization; Smart grid; Vehicle-to-grid,Charging (batteries); Electric energy storage; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Bi-directional power flows; Charging infrastructures; Controlled charging; Electricity pricing; Smart grid; Stationary energy storages; Uncontrolled charging; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle-to-grid,,MDPI AG,19961073,,,,English,Energies,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059310581,

Here we investigate the activity of human AMP LL37 against Escherichia coli by integrating quantitative, population and single-cell level experiments with theoretical modeling. We observe an unexpected, rapid absorption and retention of a large number of LL37 peptides by E. coli cells upon the inhibition of their growth, which increases population survivability. This transition occurs more likely in the late stage of cell division cycles. Cultures with high cell density exhibit two distinct subpopulations: a non-growing population that absorb peptides and a growing population that survive owing to the sequestration of the AMPs by others. A mathematical model based on this binary picture reproduces the rather surprising observations, including the increase of the minimum inhibitory concentration with cell density (even in dilute cultures) and the extensive lag in growth introduced by sub-lethal dosages of LL37 peptides. © Snoussi et al.",,"cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL 37; antiinfective agent; antimicrobial cationic peptide; CAP18 lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; protein binding; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; calibration; cell counting; cell culture; cell cycle; cell density; cell division; cell growth; cell interaction; cell size; cell subpopulation; cell survival; colorimetry; Escherichia coli; growth inhibition; human; live cell imaging; mathematical model; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; phase contrast microscopy; drug effect; Escherichia coli; growth, development and aging; kinetics; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; microbial viability; theoretical model; Anti-Infective Agents; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Escherichia coli; Humans; Kinetics; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Microbial Viability; Models, Theoretical; Protein Binding",,eLife Sciences Publications Ltd,2050084X,,,30560784,English,eLife,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058724393,

Identifying individual and environmental needs and barriers at local levels is important to inform community-based interventions. This qualitative study used interviews based on constructs from social cognitive theory. 101 adolescent mothers, family members, health-related personnel and community workers in Budondo sub-county (Jinja district), eastern Uganda were interviewed. Young mothers had needs, related to going back to school, home-based small businesses; social needs, care support and belonging to their families, employment, shelter, clothing, personal land and animals, medical care and delivery materials. Barriers to meeting their needs included: lack of skills in income generation and food preparation, harsh treatment, pregnancy and childcare costs, lack of academic qualifications, lack of adequate shelter and land, lack of foods to make complementary feeds for infants, insufficient access to medicines, tailored health care and appropriate communications. Using the social cognitive framework, this study identified myriad needs of young mothers and barriers to improving maternal/child nutrition and health. Adolescent-mother-and-child-friendly environments are needed at local levels while continuing to reduce broader socio-cultural and economic barriers to health equity. Findings may help direct future interventions for improved adolescent maternal/child nutrition and health. © 2018 by the authors.

Here, we present the use of supervised machine learning to treat differential mobility spectrometry  mass spectrometry data for ten topological classes of drug candidates. We demonstrate that the gas-phase clustering behavior probed in our experiments can be used to predict the candidates condensed phase molecular properties, such as cell permeability, solubility, polar surface area, and water/octanol distribution coefficient. All of these measurements are performed in minutes and require mere nanograms of each drug examined. Moreover, by tuning gas temperature within the differential mobility spectrometer, one can fine tune the extent of ion-solvent clustering to separate subtly different molecular geometries and to discriminate molecules of very similar physicochemical properties. © 2018, The Author(s).",,octanol; bioassay; drug; experimental study; machine learning; mass spectrometry; molecular analysis; physicochemical property; research work; spectrometry; Article; cell membrane permeability; controlled study; geometry; hydrogen bond; machine learning; mass spectrometry; molecular size; physical chemistry; protonation; spectroscopy; supervised machine learning; surface area,,Nature Publishing Group,20411723,,,30504922,English,Nat.

Health authorities require information about current associations between health outcomes and weather or climate, vulnerable populations, projections of future risks and adaptation opportunities in order to reduce exposures, empower individuals to take needed protective actions and build climate-resilient health systems. An increasing number of health authorities from local to national levels seek this information by conducting climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments. While assessments can provide valuable information to plan for climate change impacts, the results of many studies are not helping to build the global evidence-base of knowledge in this area. They are also often not integrated into adaptation decision making, sometimes because the health sector is not involved in climate change policy making processes at the national level. Significant barriers related to data accessibility, a limited number of climate and health models, uncertainty in climate projections, and a lack of funding and expertise, particularly in developing countries, challenge health authority efforts to conduct rigorous assessments and apply the findings. This paper examines the evolution of climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments, including guidance developed for such projects, the number of assessments that have been conducted globally and implementation of the findings to support health adaptation action. Greater capacity building that facilitates assessments from local to national scales will support collaborative efforts to protect health from current climate hazards and future climate change. Health sector officials will benefit from additional resources and partnership opportunities to ensure that evidence about climate change impacts on health is effectively translated into needed actions to build health resilience. © 2018 by the authors.

Here we investigated the extent with which assumed light from above preferences are affected by body orientation and the orientation of the retina relative to gravity. We tested the ability to extract shape-from-shading with seven human male observers positioned in multiple orientations relative to gravity using a modified KUKA anthropomorphic robot arm. Observers made convex-concave judgments of a central monocularly viewed stimulus with orientations of a shading gradient consistent with being lit from one of 24 simulated illumination directions. By positioning observers in different roll-tilt orientations relative to gravity and when supine, we were able to monitor change in the light-from-above prior (the orientation at which a shaded disk appears maximally convex). The results confirm previous findings that the light-from-above prior changes with body orientation relative to gravity. Interestingly, the results varied also with retinal orientation as well as an additional component that was approximately twice the frequency of retinal orientation. We use a modelling approach to show that the data are well predicted by summing retinal orientation with cross-multiplied utricle and saccule signals of the vestibular system, yielding gravity-dependent biases in the ability to extract shape-from-shading. We conclude that priors such as light coming from above appear to be constantly updated by neural processes that monitor self-orientation to achieve optimal object recognition over moderate deviations from upright posture at the cost of poor recognition when extremely tilted relative to gravity. © 2018, The Author(s).",,adult; article; body position; decision making; gravity; human; illumination; male; recognition; retina; robotics; saccule; simulation; stimulus; utricle,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,30310139,English,Sci.

A reliable identification of lattice symmetry is a crucial first step for materials characterization and analytics. Current methods require a user-specified threshold, and are unable to detect average symmetries for defective structures. Here, we propose a machine learning-based approach to automatically classify structures by crystal symmetry. First, we represent crystals by calculating a diffraction image, then construct a deep learning neural network model for classification. Our approach is able to correctly classify a dataset comprising more than 100,000 simulated crystal structures, including heavily defective ones. The internal operations of the neural network are unraveled through attentive response maps, demonstrating that it uses the same landmarks a materials scientist would use, although never explicitly instructed to do so.

The IOP of male Sprague-Dawley rats was raised in one eye to ~35 mmHg for 1 hour/day on 6 days each week using vascular loops. Single-flash ERG traces and volumetric UHR-OCT images of the ONH were acquired from both eyes before, during and after IOP elevations at weeks 1, 5 and 9 of the study. The UHR-OCT images showed depression of the posterior eye around the ONH during the IOP elevations, the magnitude of which increased significantly from week 1 to week 9 (p = 0.01). The ERG a-wave and b-wave amplitudes increased temporarily during IOP elevations and returned to normal ~30 minutes after loop removal. Recurrent intermittent IOP spikes caused > 30% decrease in the ERG a-wave and b-wave amplitudes measured during the IOP elevations over the course of 2 months. This study suggests that recurrent, relatively short-duration IOP spikes for extended period of time are associated with peri-ONH tissue hypercompliance and reduced retinal functional response to visual stimulation during acute IOP elevation. © 2018 The Author(s).",,adult; animal experiment; article; controlled study; intraocular pressure; male; nonhuman; optic disk; optical coherence tomography; rat; retina; spike; Sprague Dawley rat; visual stimulation,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,,English,Sci.

Traditional research methods are poorly suited to operationalize the agile, iterative trials required to evidence and optimize these digitally mediated interventions. Objective: We sought to contribute a resource to support the quantification, analysis, and visualization of analytic indicators of effective engagement with mHealth apps for chronic conditions. Methods: We applied user-centered design methods to design and develop an Analytics Platform to Evaluate Effective Engagement (APEEE) with consumer mHealth apps for chronic conditions and implemented the platform to analyze both retrospective and prospective data generated from a smartphone-based pain self-management app called iCanCope for young people with chronic pain. Results: Through APEEE, we were able to automate the process of defining, operationalizing, and evaluating effective engagement with iCanCope. Configuring the platform to integrate with the app was feasible and provided investigators with a resource to consolidate, analyze, and visualize engagement data generated by participants in real time. Preliminary efforts to evaluate APEEE showed that investigators perceived the platform to be an acceptable evaluative resource and were satisfied with its design, functionality, and performance. Investigators saw potential in APEEE to accelerate and augment evidence generation and expressed enthusiasm for adopting the platform to support their evaluative practice once fully implemented.

So far, a comprehensive understanding of the magnetic excitations in such 2D magnets remains missing. Here we report polarized micro-Raman spectroscopy studies on a 2D honeycomb ferromagnet CrI 3 . We show the definitive evidence of two sets of zero-momentum spin waves at frequencies of 2.28 terahertz (THz) and 3.75 THz, respectively, that are three orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional ferromagnets. By tracking the thickness dependence of both spin waves, we reveal that both are surface spin waves with lifetimes an order of magnitude longer than their temporal periods. Our results of two branches of high-frequency, long-lived surface spin waves in 2D CrI 3 demonstrate intriguing spin dynamics and intricate interplay with fluctuations in the 2D limit, thus opening up opportunities for ultrafast spintronics incorporating 2D magnets. © 2018, The Author(s).",,frequency analysis; magnetic method; Raman spectroscopy; two-dimensional modeling; Article; crystal; dispersion; magnetism; molecular dynamics; Raman spectrometry; surface property; temperature dependence; thickness,,Nature Publishing Group,20411723,,,30504853,English,Nat.

This model is incorrect for basin-filling cirque glaciers, as we have demonstrated at West Washmawapta Glacier, a small glacier in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Here we report observations at the same glacier that assess whether complex temporal variations of flow also occur. For parts of three summers, we measured daily displacements of the glacier surface. In one year, four short-duration speed-up events were recorded. Three of the events occurred during the intervals of warmest weather, when melt was most rapid; the fourth event occurred immediately following heavy rain. We interpret the speed-up events as manifestations of enhanced water inputs to the glacier bed and associated slip lubrication by increased water volumes and pressures. No further speed-ups occurred in the final month of the melt season, despite warm temperatures and several rainstorms; the dominant subglacial water system likely transformed from one of poorly connected cavities to one with an efficient channel network. The seasonal evolution of hydrology and flow resembles behaviors documented at other, larger temperate glaciers and indicates that analyses of cirque erosion cannot rely on simple assumptions about ice dynamics. © The Author(s) 2018 This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",glacial geomorphology; ice velocity; mountain glaciers; subglacial processes,alpine environment; cirque; flow velocity; geomorphology; glacier flow; mountain region; spatial variation; subglacial deposit; valley glacier; British Columbia; Canada; Canada; Norway; Rocky Mountains; West Washmawapta Glacier,,Cambridge University Press,221430,,,,English,J.

Using the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), we identified initiators (365-day washout period) of DPP4 inhibitors and relevant comparators including initiators of sulfonylureas, metformin, thiazolidinediones, and insulin between January 2007 and January 2016 to quantify the association between DPP4 inhibitors and three acute health events  acute kidney injury, respiratory tract infections, and acute pancreatitis. The associations between drug and study outcomes were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for deciles of high-dimensional propensity scores and number of additional glucose lowering agents. After controlling for potential confounders, the risk was not significantly increased or decreased for initiators of DPP4 inhibitors compared to sulfonylureas (hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for acute kidney injury: 0.81 [0.561.18]; HR for respiratory tract infections: 0.93 [0.841.04]; HR for acute pancreatitis 1.03 [0.422.52], metformin (HR for respiratory tract infection 0.91 [0.651.27]), thiazolidinediones (HR for acute kidney injury: 1.12 [0.602.10]; HR for respiratory tract infections: 1.02 [0.861.21]; HR for acute pancreatitis: 1.21 [0.255.72]), or insulin (HR for acute kidney injury: 1.40 [0.772.55]; HR for respiratory tract infections: 0.74 [0.600.92]; HR for acute pancreatitis: 1.01 [0.244.19]). Initiators of DPP4 inhibitors were associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury when compared to metformin initiators (HR [95% CI] for acute kidney injury: 1.85 [1.103.12], although this association was attenuated when DPP4 inhibitor monotherapy was compared to metformin monotherapy exposure as a time-dependent variable (HR 1.39 [0.912.11]). Initiation of a DPP4 inhibitor was not associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury, respiratory tract infections, or acute pancreatitis compared to sulfonylureas or other glucose-lowering therapies. © 2018, The Author(s).",,,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,30310100,English,Sci.

This effect was observed in semiconductors like GaAs which has a direct bandgap of very low effective mass and an indirect subband of high effective mass which lies ~300 meV above the former. In contrast to GaAs, bulk silicon has a very high energy spacing (~1 eV) which renders the initiation of transfer-induced NDR unobservable. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT), semi-empirical 10 orbital (sp3d5s?) Tight Binding and Ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) methods we show for the first time that (a) Gunn Effect can be induced in silicon nanowires (SiNW) with diameters of 3.1 nm under +3% strain and an electric field of 5000 V/cm, (b) the onset of NDR in the I-V characteristics is reversibly adjustable by strain and (c) strain modulates the resistivity by a factor 2.3 for SiNWs of normal I-V characteristics i.e. those without NDR. These observations are promising for applications of SiNWs in electromechanical sensors and adjustable microwave oscillators. It is noteworthy that the observed NDC is different in principle from Esaki-Diode and Resonant Tunneling Diodes (RTD) in which NDR originates from tunneling effect. © 2018 The Author(s).",,,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,,English,Sci.

Some of the challenges facing researchers include the limited volume of biofluids, rapid and high-throughput sampling requirements, and the lack of reliable methods. Coupled to the above, growing interest in the monitoring of kinetics and dynamics of miniaturized biosystems has spurred the demand for development of novel and revolutionary methodologies for analysis of biofluids. The applicability of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is investigated as a potential technology to fulfill the aforementioned requirements. As analytes with sufficient diversity in their physicochemical features, nicotine, N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide, and diclofenac were selected as test compounds for the study. The objective was to develop methodologies that would allow repeated non-depletive sampling from 96-well plates, using 100 ?L of sample. Initially, thin film-SPME was investigated. Results revealed substantial depletion and consequent disruption in the system. Therefore, new ultra-thin coated fibers were developed. The applicability of this device to the described sampling scenario was tested by determining the protein binding of the analytes. Results showed good agreement with rapid equilibrium dialysis. The presented method allows high-throughput analysis using small volumes, enabling fast reliable free and total concentration determinations without disruption of system equilibrium. © 2018 The Author(s).",,,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,29348436,English,Sci.

Egypt has been employing waterpipe tobacco labelling for a decade, however, their effectiveness is unknown. Our overall aim was to measure the effectiveness of pictorial health warnings (PHWs) on waterpipe tobacco packs (WTPs) through participant memory recall and to investigate whether they induced behavioural responses in waterpipe smokers and deterred uptake of WTS in non-smokers, examining the differentials of effectiveness among socio-demographic subgroups. Subjects and methods We conducted two surveys including 1490 adult current waterpipe smokers, 73 former waterpipe smokers, and 451 non-smokers in Cairo and a rural village in Egypt between 20152017. Participants who noticed PHWs on WTPs were asked questions about salience, communication of health risks, public support, cognitive processing, and self-reported behavioural responses (current waterpipe smokers: reduce consumption, forgo a smoke, quit attempts; former waterpipe smokers: quit; non-smokers: deter WTS initiation). Univariate and multivariable statistical analyses were performed. Results Participants mean age was 35 years, mostly males (90.4%), waterpipe smokers (74.0%) and rural residents (59.3%). Approximately two-thirds of participants noticed PHWs on WTPs. Salience was significantly less among females, urban residents and participants with high literacy. More than three-quarters of participants reported that WTS health risks were communicated through the warnings. At least half of participants cognitively processed the warnings: 56.3% thought of the warnings when WTPs were out of sight; non-smokers understood the warnings (83.2%) and discussed them with others (90.3%) significantly more than current (76.0% and 72.5%, respectively) and former waterpipe smokers (81.0% and 61.9%, respectively). Participants reported that PHWs on WTPs motivated 58.5% of waterpipe smokers to think about quitting; 64.5% to reduce their consumption; 42.2% to forgo a smoke; 24.5% to attempt to quit; 57.1% of former waterpipe smokers to successfully quit; and 59.3% of non-smokers to remain smoke-free. Conclusions Findings suggest that inserting PHWs on WTPs is an effective waterpipe tobacco labelling policy. Countries with similarly high rates of WTS should consider adopting WTP PHWs within a comprehensive regulatory framework. © 2018 Mostafa et al.

We extremize various cubic and quartic couplings in the two-to-two scattering amplitudes of vector particles. Saturating these bounds, we encounter known integrable models with O(N) symmetry such as the O(N) Gross-Neveu and non-linear sigma models and the scattering of kinks in the sine-Gordon model. We also considered more general mass spectra for which we move away from the integrable realm. In this regime we find (numerically, through a large N analysis and sometimes even analytically) that the S-matrices saturating the various coupling bounds have an extremely rich structure exhibiting infinite resonances and virtual states in the various kinematical sheets. They are rather exotic in that they admit no particle production yet they do not obey Yang-Baxter equations. We discuss their physical (ir)relevance and speculate, based on some preliminary numerics, that they might be close to more realistic theories with particle production. © 2018, The Author(s).",Field Theories in Lower Dimensions; Integrable Field Theories; Nonperturbative Effects; Scattering Amplitudes,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

These MNPs were subjected to self-assembly with a poly(acrylic acid)-block-poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) double-hydrophilic block copolymer (DHBC), PAA-b-PHEA, to form water-dispersible magnetic polyion complex (MPIC) micelles. Large Fe 3 O 4 crystallites were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and magnetic suspensions of MPIC micelles exhibited improved colloidal stability in aqueous environments over a wide pH and ionic strength range. Biological cells incubated for 48 h with MPIC micelles at the highest concentration (1250 µg of Fe 3 O 4 per mL) had a cell viability of 91%, as compared with 51% when incubated with bare (unprotected) MNPs. Cell internalization, visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and TEM, exhibited strong dependence on the MPIC micelle concentration and incubation time, as also evidenced by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The usefulness of MPIC micelles for cellular radiofrequency magnetic field hyperthermia (MFH) was also confirmed, as the MPIC micelles showed a dual dose-dependent effect (concentration and duration of magnetic field exposure) on the viability of L929 mouse fibroblasts and U87 human glioblastoma epithelial cells. © 2018 by the authors.

We report the findings from a content analysis of audio-recorded discussions of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and benzodiazepine deprescribing in primary care. Methods: Participants were healthcare providers (n = 13) from primary care practices (n = 3) and patients aged ?65 (n = 24) who were chronic users of PPIs or benzodiazepines. The EMPOWER educational brochures were distributed prior to (n = 15) or after (n = 9) the patients usual healthcare provider appointment. Conversations were audio-recorded and coded using MEDICODE to analyze who initiated different themes, whether they followed a monologue or dialogue style, and to what extent the thematic content addressed issues pertaining to: dosage/instructions, medication action and efficacy, risk/adverse effects, attitudes/emotions, adherence and follow up. Descriptive analysis of the conversations was performed with comparison between patients who received the EMPOWER brochure before or after their appointments. Results: Patients were mostly women (67%) with a mean age of 74 ± 6?years. For PPI users, prior education resulted in a greater proportion of themes initiated by patients (44% versus 17%) and maintaining dialogue-style conversations (48% versus 28%). Among benzodiazepine users, conversation initiation (52% versus 47%) and conversation style was similar between both groups. The content of deprescribing conversations for PPIs revealed that patients and their healthcare providers focused less on dosage/instructions, and more on the medication action and efficacy and the necessity for follow up. Conversations about stopping benzodiazepines were more likely to stagnate on the if rather than the how. Conclusion: The initiation, style and content of the conversations varied between PPI and benzodiazepine users, suggesting that healthcare providers will need to tailor deprescribing conversations accordingly. © The Author(s), 2018.",aged; decision-making; deprescribing; education; potentially inappropriate medication; primary health care; public health professional; shared,benzodiazepine; proton pump inhibitor; aged; Article; audio recording; clinical article; clinical practice; content analysis; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; female; follow up; health care personnel; health education; human; interpersonal communication; male; medication compliance; prescription; primary medical care; priority journal; risk factor,,SAGE Publications Ltd,20420986,,,,English,Ther.

Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors in particular lack inversion symmetry, yielding an antisymmetric form of spin-orbit coupling that admits both spin-singlet and spin-triplet components of the superconducting wavefunction. Here, we present an experimental and theoretical study of two intrinsic TMD superconductors with large spin-orbit coupling in the atomic layer limit, metallic 2H-TaS 2 and 2H-NbSe 2 . We investigate the superconducting properties as the material is reduced to monolayer thickness and show that high-field measurements point to the largest upper critical field thus reported for an intrinsic TMD superconductor. In few-layer samples, we find the enhancement of the upper critical field is sustained by the dominance of spin-orbit coupling over weak interlayer coupling, providing additional candidate systems for supporting unconventional superconducting states in two dimensions. © 2018 The Author(s).",,chalcogen; transition element; electron; experimental study; measurement method; superconductivity; theoretical study; topology; transition element; two-dimensional modeling; anisotropy; Article; comparative study; controlled study; crystal; encapsulation; qualitative analysis; superconductivity; surface property; temperature sensitivity; theoretical study; thickness,,Nature Publishing Group,20411723,,,29650994,English,Nat.

Aims/objectives: Our aim was to assess the effect of portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter air cleaner use during pregnancy on fetal growth. Methods: The Ulaanbaatar Gestation and Air Pollution Research (UGAAR) study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial conducted in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Non-smoking pregnant women recruited at ?18 weeks gestation were randomized to an intervention (12 air cleaners in homes from early pregnancy until childbirth) or control (no air cleaners) group. Participants were not blinded to their intervention status. Demographic, health, and birth outcome data were obtained via questionnaires and clinic records. We used unadjusted linear and logistic regression and time-to-event analysis to evaluate the intervention. Our primary outcome was birth weight. Secondary outcomes were gestational age-adjusted birth weight, birth length, head circumference, gestational age at birth, and small for gestational age. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01741051). Results: We recruited 540 participants (272 control and 268 intervention) from January 9, 2014 to May 1, 2015. There were 465 live births and 28 losses to follow up. We previously reported a 29% (95% CI: 21, 37%) reduction in indoor PM 2.5 concentrations with portable HEPA filter air cleaner use. The median (25th, 75th percentile) birth weights for control and intervention participants were 3450 g (3150, 3800 g) and 3550 g (3200, 3800 g), respectively (p = 0.34). The intervention was not associated with birth weight (18 g; 95% CI: ?84, 120 g), but in a pre-specified subgroup analysis of 429 term births the intervention was associated with an 85 g (95% CI: 3, 167 g) increase in mean birth weight.

We examined changes in cigarette consumption patterns over a four-year period and determined which factors were associated with smoking transitions. Methods: We used data from a cohort of smokers from the 20082012 ITC Mexico Survey administrations to investigate transitions from non-daily (ND; n = 669), daily light (DL; ?5 cigarettes per day (cpd); n = 643), and daily heavy (DH; >5 cpd; n = 761) smoking patterns. To identify which factors (i.e., sociodemographic measures, perceived addiction, quit behavior, social norms) were associated with smoking transitions, we stratified on smoking status at time t (ND, DL, DH) and used multinomial (ND, DL) and binomial (DH) logistic regression to examine transitions (quitting/reducing or increasing versus same level for ND and DL, quitting/reducing versus same level for DH). Results: ND smokers were more likely to quit at follow-up than DL or DH smokers. DH smokers who reduced their consumption to ND were more likely to quit eventually compared to those who continued as DH. Smokers who perceived themselves as addicted had lower odds of quitting/reducing smoking consumption at follow-up compared to smokers who did not, regardless of smoking status at the prior survey. Quit attempts and quit intentions were also associated with quitting/reducing consumption. Conclusions: Reducing consumption may eventually lead to cessation, even for heavier smokers. The findings that perceived addiction and quit behavior were important predictors of changing consumption for all groups may offer insights into potential interventions. © 2018 The Authors",Cessation; Mexico; Perceived addiction; Smoking intensity; Smoking transitions,cigarette smoke; adult; Article; controlled study; demography; female; follow up; human; longitudinal study; male; Mexican; Mexico; outcome assessment; priority journal; smoking; smoking cessation; social norm; tobacco consumption; young adult,,Elsevier Ltd,23528532,,,,English,Addict.

A recent study of the phenomenon using the signal detection theory (SDT) model called into question all theoretical accounts of belief bias by demonstrating that belief-based differences in the ability to discriminate between valid and invalid syllogisms may be an artifact stemming from the use of inappropriate linear measurement models such as analysis of variance (Dube et al., Psychological Review, 117(3), 831863, 2010). The discrepancy between Dube et al.s, Psychological Review, 117(3), 831863 (2010) results and the previous three decades of work, together with formers methodological criticisms suggests the need to revisit earlier results, this time collecting confidence-rating responses. Using a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis, we reanalyzed a corpus of 22 confidence-rating studies (N = 993). The results indicated that extensive replications using confidence-rating data are unnecessary as the observed receiver operating characteristic functions are not systematically asymmetric. These results were subsequently corroborated by a novel experimental design based on SDTs generalized area theorem. Although the meta-analysis confirms that believability does not influence discriminability unconditionally, it also confirmed previous results that factors such as individual differences mediate the effect. The main point is that data from previous and future studies can be safely analyzed using appropriate hierarchical methods that do not require confidence ratings. More generally, our results set a new standard for analyzing data and evaluating theories in reasoning. Important methodological and theoretical considerations for future work on belief bias and related domains are discussed. © 2018, The Author(s).",Belief bias; Deductive reasoning; Hierarchical Bayesian; Meta-analysis; Signal detection theory; Syllogisms,Bayes theorem; human; logic; meta analysis; receiver operating characteristic; thinking; Bayes Theorem; Humans; Logic; ROC Curve; Thinking,,Springer New York LLC,10699384,,,29943172,English,Psychonom.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of several abiotic and biotic drivers of early tree seedling recruitment across an alpine treeline ecotone. In two consecutive years, we sowed seeds of low- and high-elevation provenances of Larix decidua (European larch) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) below, at, and above the current treeline into intact vegetation and into open microsites with artificially removed surface vegetation, as well as into plots protected from seed predators and herbivores. Seedling emergence and early establishment in treatment and in control plots were monitored over two years. Tree seedling emergence occurred at and several hundred metres above the current treeline when viable seeds and suitable microsites for germination were available. However, dense vegetation cover at lower elevations and winter mortality at higher elevations particularly limited early recruitment. Post-dispersal predation, species, and provenance also affected emergence and early establishment. This study demonstrates the importance of understanding multiple abiotic and biotic drivers of early seedling recruitment that should be incorporated into predictions of treeline dynamics under climate change. © 2018 The Author(s).",,article; case report; climate change; clinical article; decidua; driver; ecotone; germination; granivore; human; Larix; mortality; nonhuman; Norway spruce; predation; prediction; seedling emergence; vegetation; winter,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,,English,Sci.

An example of such a topographical substrate is periodic gratings, where the dimensions of the periodic gratings influence cell morphology and directs cell differentiation. We first develop a novel sample preparation technique using Spurr's resin to allow for cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy imaging of cells on grating grooves, and observed that the plasma membrane on the basal surface of these cells can deform and bend into grooves between the gratings. We postulate that such membrane bending is an important first step in eliciting downstream effects. Thus, we use a combination of image analysis and mathematical modeling to explain the extent of bending of basal membrane into grooves. We show that the extent to which the basal membrane bends into grooves depends on both groove width and angle of the grating ridge. Our model predicts that the basal membrane will bend into grooves when they are wider than 1.9 ?m in width. The existence of such a threshold may provide an explanation for how the width of periodic gratings may bring about cellular downstream effects, such as cell proliferation or differentiation. © 2018 The Author(s).",,,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,,English,Sci.

Pluripotent stem cells have great potential in the study for this late-onset disease, but acquirement of cells that are robust in quantity and quality is still technically demanding. Biophysical cues have been shown to direct stem cell fate, but the effect of different topographies in the lineage commitment and subsequent maturation stages of cells have been less examined. Using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we applied topographical patterns sequentially during differentiation stages and examined their ability to influence derivation yield and functionality of regionalized subtype-specific DA neurons. Gratings showed higher yield of DA neurons and may be beneficial for initial lineage commitment. Cells derived on pillars in the terminal differentiation stage have increased neuronal complexity, and were more capable of firing repetitive action potentials, showing that pillars yielded better network formation and functionality. Our topography platform can be applied to patient-derived iPSCs as well, and that cells harbouring LRRK2 mutation were more functionally mature when optimal topographies were applied sequentially.

While much of the efforts have traditionally been directed at geometrically frustrated antiferromagnets, recent studies reveal that systems featuring competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions are also promising candidate materials. We find that this competition leads to the notion of special temperatures, analogous to those of gases, at which the competing interactions balance, and the system is quasi-ideal. Although induced by weak perturbing interactions, these special temperatures are surprisingly high and constitute an accessible experimental diagnostic of eventual order or spin-liquid properties. The well characterised Hamiltonian and extended low-temperature susceptibility measurement of the canonical frustrated ferromagnet Dy2Ti2O7 enables us to formulate both a phenomenological and microscopic theory of special temperatures for magnets. Other members of this class of magnets include kapellasite Cu3Zn(OH)6Cl2 and the spinel GeCo2O4. © 2018 The Author(s).",,detection method; experimental study; liquid; physics; temperature; Article; chemical structure; gas; high temperature; low temperature; magnetism; molecular interaction; Monte Carlo method; physical phenomena; physics; thermodynamics,,Nature Publishing Group,20411723,,,29784922,English,Nat.

This warming deepened the soil active layer and triggered large mass losses from the watershed's glaciers, resulting in a ~10 times increase in delivery of glacial meltwaters, sediment, organic carbon and legacy contaminants to Lake Hazen, a >70% decrease in lake water residence time, and near certainty of summer ice-free conditions. Concomitantly, the community assemblage of diatom primary producers in the lake shifted dramatically with declining ice cover, from shoreline benthic to open-water planktonic species, and the physiological condition of the only fish species in the lake, Arctic Char, declined significantly. Collectively, these changes place Lake Hazen in a biogeochemical, limnological and ecological regime unprecedented within the past ~300 years. © 2018 The Author(s).",,lake water; organic carbon; active layer; community structure; data set; diatom; glacier mass balance; lake water; physiology; salmonid; temperature effect; warming; air temperature; Arctic; Article; climate change; deglaciation; diatom; fish; ice cover; lake; nonhuman; plankton; sediment; soil; summer; warming; water contamination; watershed; Canada; Lake Hazen; Nunavut; Bacillariophyta; Salvelinus alpinus,,Nature Publishing Group,20411723,,,29599477,English,Nat.

Owing to the lack of an overarching theory, however, a variety of model approximations exist to represent the subglacial drainage system. The Subglacial Hydrology Model Intercomparison Project (SHMIP) provides a set of synthetic experiments to compare existing and future models. We present the results from 13 participating models with a focus on effective pressure and discharge. For many applications (e.g. steady states and annual variations, low input scenarios) a simple model, such as an inefficient-system-only model, a flowline or lumped model, or a porous-layer model provides results comparable to those of more complex models. However, when studying short term (e.g. diurnal) variations of the water pressure, the use of a two-dimensional model incorporating physical representations of both efficient and inefficient drainage systems yields results that are significantly different from those of simpler models and should be preferentially applied. The results also emphasise the role of water storage in the response of water pressure to transient recharge. Finally, we find that the localisation of moulins has a limited impact except in regions of sparse moulin density. © The Author(s) 2018 This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",glacier hydrology; glacier modelling; glaciological model experiments; ice-sheet modelling; subglacial processes,glacial hydrology; hydrological modeling; ice mechanics; ice sheet; recharge; subglacial deposit; two-dimensional modeling; water storage,,Cambridge University Press,221430,,,,English,J.

While transfer function training sets are typically of local-to regional-scale in extent, combining those data to cover broad ecohydrological gradients, from the regional-to continental- and hemispheric-scales, is useful to assess if ecological optima of species vary geographically and therefore may have also varied over time. Continental-scale transfer functions can also maximise modern analogue quality without losing reconstructive skill, providing the opportunity to contextualise understanding of purely statistical outputs with greater insight into the biogeography of organisms. Here, we compiled, at moderate taxonomic resolution, a dataset of nearly 2000 modern surface peatland testate amoeba samples from 137 peatlands throughout North America. We developed transfer functions using four model types, tested them statistically and applied them to independent palaeoenvironmental data. By subdividing the dataset into eco-regions, we examined biogeographical patterns of hydrological optima and species distribution across North America. We combined our new dataset with data from Europe to create a combined transfer function. The performance of our North-American transfer function was equivalent to published models and reconstructions were comparable to those developed using regional training sets. The new model can therefore be used as an effective tool to reconstruct peatland palaeohydrology throughout the North American continent. Some eco-regions exhibited lower taxonomic diversity and some key indicator taxa had restricted ranges. However, these patterns occurred against a background of general cosmopolitanism, at the moderate taxonomic resolution used. Likely biogeographical patterns at higher taxonomic resolution therefore do not affect transfer function performance. Output from the combined North American and European model suggested that any geographical limit of scale beyond which further compilation of peatland testate amoeba data would not be valid has not yet been reached, therefore advocating the potential for a Holarctic synthesis of peatland testate amoeba data. Extending data synthesis to the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere would be more challenging due to higher regional endemism in those areas. © 2018 The Authors",Biogeography; Cosmopolitanism; Ecology; North America; Peatland; Testate amoebae; Transfer function; Water table,Ecology; Groundwater; Protozoa; Wetlands; Biogeography; Cosmopolitanism; North America; Peatland; Testate amoebae; Water tables; Transfer functions; biogeography; comparative study; ecohydrology; endemism; fossil assemblage; Holarctic Region; paleoenvironment; paleohydrology; peatland; protist; reconstruction; Southern Hemisphere; taxonomy; transfer function; water table; Europe; North America,,Elsevier Ltd,2773791,,QSRED,,English,Quat.

This dataset can be used to address theoretical questions about plant strategy and trade-offs, traitenvironment relationships and environmental filtering, and trait variation across spatial scales, to validate satellite data, and to inform Earth system model parameters. Main types of variable contained: The database contains 91,970 measurements of 18 plant traits. The most frequently measured traits (> 1,000 observations each) include plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf fresh and dry mass, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus content, leaf C:N and N:P, seed mass, and stem specific density. Spatial location and grain: Measurements were collected in tundra habitats in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, including Arctic sites in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia and Siberia, alpine sites in the European Alps, Colorado Rockies, Caucasus, Ural Mountains, Pyrenees, Australian Alps, and Central Otago Mountains (New Zealand), and sub-Antarctic Marion Island. More than 99% of observations are georeferenced. Time period and grain: All data were collected between 1964 and 2018. A small number of sites have repeated trait measurements at two or more time periods. Major taxa and level of measurement: Trait measurements were made on 978 terrestrial vascular plant species growing in tundra habitats. Most observations are on individuals (86%), while the remainder represent plot or site means or maximums per species.

The Br-terminated Br-PEO-Br with the molecular weights of 20k and 100k were used as macroinitiators. ARGET ATRP was performed with ppm level amount CuBr2 as the catalyst and ascorbic acid as the reducing agent to overcome the sensitivity to oxygen in a traditional ATRP. The molecular weight of the PMMA block was manipulated by changing the molar ratio of monomers to the Br-PEO-Br macroinitiators. The synthesis of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA and its structure was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and 1H NMR, and the molecular weight of the PMMA block was determined by 1H NMR. Aqueous solutions of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA were prepared by solvent-exchange, and their microstructures were examined by tensiometry, static light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. The effects of molecular weight of the PMMA and PEO blocks on the microstructure were elucidated.

The amyloid beta (A?) peptide has been implicated in the cause of AD, where the peptides undergo a conformational change and form neurotoxic amyloid oligomers which cause neuronal cell death. While AD has no cure, preventative measures are being designed to either slow down or stop the progression of this neurodegenerative disease. One of these measures involves dietary supplements with polyunsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). This omega-3 fatty acid is a key component of brain development and has been suggested to reduce the progression of cognitive decline. However, different studies have yielded different results as to whether DHA has positive, negative, or no effects on A? fibril formation. We believe that these discrepancies can be explained with varying concentrations of DHA. Here, we test the inhibitory effect of different concentrations of DHA on amyloid fibril formation using atomic force microscopy. Our results show that DHA has a strong inhibitory effect on A?142 fibril formation at lower concentrations (50% reduction in fibril length) than higher concentrations above its critical micelle concentration (70% increase in fibril length and three times the length of those at lower concentrations). We provide evidence that various concentrations of DHA can play a role in the inhibitory effects of amyloid fibril formation in vitro and help explain the discrepancies observed in previous studies. © 2018 by the authors.",Alzheimers disease; Amyloid; Amyloid fibrils; Amyloid-beta A?; Atomic force microscopy; Docosahexaenoic acid; Omega-3; Polyunsaturated fatty acid,"amyloid; amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta-protein (1-42); docosahexaenoic acid; peptide fragment; protein aggregate; atomic force microscopy; chemistry; dose response; human; ultrastructure; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Peptide Fragments; Protein Aggregates",,MDPI AG,14203049,,MOLEF,30486385,English,Molecules,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057502810,

The main objective was to examine how beverage availability in school vending machines changes over three school years across schools in distinct school nutrition policy contexts. Secondary objectives were to examine how students' weekday SSB intake varies with time and identify longitudinal associations between beverage availability and SSB intake. Methods: This longitudinal study used data from the COMPASS study (2013/14-2015/16), representing 7679 students from 78 Canadian secondary schools and three provincial school nutrition policy contexts (Alberta - voluntary guidelines, Ontario public - mandatory guidelines, and Ontario private schools - no guidelines). We assessed availability of 10 beverage categories in schools' vending machines via the COMPASS School Environment Application and participants' intake of three SSB varieties (soft drinks, sweetened coffees/teas, and energy drinks) via a questionnaire. Hierarchical regression models were used to examine whether: i) progression of time and policy group were associated with beverage availability; and, ii) beverage availability was associated with students' SSB intake. Results: Ontario public schools were significantly less likely than the other policy groups to serve SSBs in their vending machines, with the exception of flavoured milks. Vending machine beverage availability was consistent over time. Participants' overall SSB intake remained relatively stable; reductions in soft drink intake were partially offset by increased sweetened coffee/tea consumption. Relative to Ontario public schools, attending school in Alberta was associated with more frequent energy drink intake and overall SSB intake whereas attending an Ontario private school was associated with less frequent soft drink intake, with no differences in overall SSB intake. Few beverage availability variables were significantly associated with participants' SSB intake. Conclusions: Mandatory provincial school nutrition policies were predictive of more limited SSB availability in school vending machines. SSB intake was significantly lower in Ontario public and private schools, although we did not detect a direct association between SSB consumption and availability. The findings provide support for mandatory school nutrition policies, as well as the need for comprehensive school- and broader population-level efforts to reduce SSB intake. © 2018 The Author(s).",Adolescents; Canada; Dietary assessment; Longitudinal study; School nutrition policy; Schools; Sugar-sweetened beverages; Vending machines,"adolescent; Alberta; article; Canadian; coffee; energy drink; female; high school; human; human experiment; longitudinal study; machine; major clinical study; male; milk; nutrition policy; nutritional assessment; Ontario; practice guideline; questionnaire; soft drink; student; sugar-sweetened beverage; tea; administration and dosage; Alberta; beverage; carbonated beverage; catering service; diet; evaluation study; feeding behavior; food handling; nutritional status; protocol compliance; school; sugar intake; carbohydrate; sweetening agent; Adolescent; Alberta; Beverages; Carbohydrates; Carbonated Beverages; Diet; Dietary Sugars; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food Dispensers, Automatic; Food Supply; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Nutrition Policy; Nutritional Status; Ontario; Schools; Students; Sugars; Sweetening Agents",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14795868,,,30482211,English,Int.

For urban populations, access to nutritionally inadequate poor-quality food has dire developmental consequences. The long-wave impacts of malnutrition at gestational and early childhood stages are negative and can be non-reversible. Moreover, those who survive into adulthood may face a lifetime of sub-optimal physical and mental development that undermines the second and third UN Sustainable Development Goals-to end hunger and to ensure healthy lives. This paper assesses the long-term health vulnerability of children with limited access to adequate and nutritious food in rapidly urbanizing cities. The analysis focuses on the African Urban Food Security Network (AFSUN) data drawn from 6453 household surveys in 11 cities and nine countries in Southern Africa. The results indicate that children in these households are consuming a limited diversity of food, have limited access to resources and have greater odds of experiencing both short-term and long-term food and nutrition insecurity. These findings demonstrate an underlying vulnerability to long-term health impacts stemming from nutritionally inadequate diets, with potentially significant costs to human capital. © 2018 by the authors.",Children; Food deserts; Food security; Malnutrition; Southern Africa; Urbanization,accessibility; child health; food availability; food quality; food security; household survey; malnutrition; nutrition; sustainable development; United Nations; urban area; urban population; urbanization; vulnerability; Southern Africa,,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057218549,

Despite its importance in the real-world, touch is often ignored in virtual environments. However, accurately simulating the sense of touch is difficult, requiring the use of high-fidelity haptic devices that are cost-prohibitive. Lower fidelity consumer-level haptic devices are becoming more widespread, yet are generally limited in perceived fidelity and the range of motion (degrees of freedom) required to realistically simulate many tasks. Studies into sound and vision suggest that the presence or absence of sound can influence task performance. Here, we explore whether the presence or absence of contextually relevant sound cues influences the performance of a simple haptic drilling task. Although the results of this study do not show any statistically significant difference in task performance with general (task-irrelevant) sound, we discuss how this is a necessary step in understanding the role of sound on haptic perception. © 2018 by the authors.",Haptics; Multimodal interactions; Sound; Task performance; Virtual environment; Virtual simulation,,,MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,22279709,,,,English,Informatics,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061230022,

However, this model does not simulate physiologically relevant tear volume and natural tear flow, air exposure, and mechanical rubbing. These factors can significantly impact release kinetics. We have developed an in vitro eye model (OcuFlow) that simulates these parameters. The aim of the study was to measure the release of PEG (polyethylene glycol), and HPMC (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) from a daily disposable hydrogel contact lens material (nelfilcon A; Dailies AquaComfort PLUS; DACP;) over 24 hrs using the OcuFlow platform. The elution of PEG and HPMC from DACP lenses was analyzed using LCMS (liquid chromatography mass spectrometry). The release of all wetting agents from the lenses followed a burst release pattern, which occurred within the first 1.5 hrs (P < 0.05). The release of PEG was greater than that of HPMC (P < 0.05). The amount of PEG and HPMC released at any given time was less than 1% of the amount in the blister pack solution. Our results suggest that HPMC and PEG are rapidly released from the CL. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

An aligned pattern cluster (APC) can reflect the conserved functionality. Discovering aligned residue associations (ARAs) in APCs can reveal subtle inner working characteristics of conserved regions of protein families. However, ARAs corresponding to different functionalities/subgroups/classes could be entangled because of subtle multiple entwined factors. METHODS: To discover and disentangle patterns from mixed-mode datasets, such as APCs when the residues are replaced by their fundamental biochemical properties list, this paper presents a novel method, Extended Aligned Residual Association Discovery and Disentanglement (E-ARADD). E-ARADD discretizes the numerical dataset to transform the mixed-mode dataset into an event-value dataset, constructs an ARA Frequency Matrix and then converts it into an adjusted Statistical Residual (SR) Vector Space (SRV) capturing statistical deviation from randomness. By applying Principal Component (PC) Decomposition on SRV, PCs ranked by their variance are obtained. Finally, the disentangled ARAs are discovered when the projections on a PC is re-projected to a vector space with the same basis vectors of SRV. RESULTS: Experiments on synthetic, cytochrome c and class A scavenger data have shown that E-ARADD can a) disentangle the entwined ARAs in APCs (with residues or biochemical properties), b) reveal subtle AR clusters relating to classes, subtle subgroups or specific functionalities. CONCLUSIONS: E-ARADD can discover and disentangle ARs and ARAs entangled in functionality and location of protein families to reveal functional subgroups and subgroup characteristics of biological conserved regions. Experimental results on synthetic data provides the proof-of-concept validation on the successful disentanglement that reveals class-associated ARAs with or without class labels as input. Experiments on cytochrome c data proved the efficacy of E-ARADD in handing both types of residue data. Our novel methodology is not only able to discover and disentangle ARs and ARAs in specific statistical/functional (PCs and RSRVs) spaces, but also their locations in the protein family functional domains. The success of E-ARADD shows its great potential to proteomic research, drug discovery and precision and personalized genetic medicine.",Aligned pattern clusters; Aligned residue associations; Disentanglement; Pattern discovery; Subgroup characteristics,,,NLM (Medline),17558794,,,30453949,English,BMC Med Genomics,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056715362,

However, Y values are rarely measured under the low energy delivery conditions that often prevail in the subsurface, and existing predictive methods for calculating Y values when the catabolic energy supply rate is limited remain poorly tested. Here, we derive and validate a new semi-theoretical method for calculating Y values: the Gibbs Energy Dynamic Yield Method (GEDYM). Method validation relies on a compilation of 132 geochemically relevant literature Y values comprising predominantly (60%) low energy (&lt; ?25 kJ (mol e?)?1) metabolisms. GEDYM is based on estimating the Gibbs energy change of the metabolic reaction (?Gmet), which links the Gibbs energy changes of the catabolic (?Gcat) and anabolic (?Gan) reactions of a microorganism through its growth yield. Given that the values of ?Gmet,?Gcat and ?Gan all depend on their respective reaction quotients, the resulting Y values account for changes in the chemical environment surrounding the cells. GEDYM incorporates an empirical relationship that accurately estimates the extent to which ?Gmet deviates from its standard state value from the relative difference between ?Gcat and its corresponding standard state value. GEDYM yields Y values with lower relative errors and statistical bias than the existing Gibbs energy dissipation method (GEDM). Using dissimilatory iron reduction, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis as examples, we illustrate the importance of considering variations in ?Gcat and ?Gan when predicting Y values for individual metabolisms. Because of its ability to dynamically adjust the values of ?Gmet and Y to variable geochemical conditions, GEDYM yields a more realistic representation of geomicrobial activity in predictive reactive transport models. © 2018 The Author(s)",,biogeochemistry; catabolism; geomicrobiology; Gibbs free energy; growth response; laboratory method; microbial activity; prediction; reactive transport; thermodynamics,,Elsevier Ltd,167037,,,,English,Geochim.

We examine how characteristics of adult tobacco users in the U.S. relate to transitions in tobacco product use. Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study data were analyzed from 12,862 adult current tobacco users who participated in Wave 1 (W1, 20132014) and Wave 2 (W2, 20142015). Three types of transitions were examined(1) adding tobacco product(s); (2) switching to non-cigarette tobacco product(s); and (3) discontinuing all tobacco useamong those currently using: (1) any tobacco product; (2) cigarettes only (i.e., exclusive cigarette); and (3) cigarettes plus another tobacco product(s) (i.e., poly-cigarette). Multinomial logistic regression analyses determined relative risk of type of transition versus no transition as a function of demographic and tobacco use characteristics. Transitions in tobacco product use among adult tobacco users were common overall, but varied among different demographic groups, including by age, sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and poverty level. Further, cigarette smokers with higher dependence scores were more likely to add product(s) and less likely to discontinue tobacco use compared to those with low dependence scores. That high nicotine dependence is a barrier to discontinuing tobacco use adds evidence to support policy to lower nicotine content of cigarettes and to evaluate new products for their potential to reduce cigarette use. © 2018, MDPI AG.

To gain fundamental insights into the mechanism of their toxicity, the interactions of phosphocholine (PC) liposomes as model membranes were studied with three types of PFCs, including perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctane sulfonate, and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid potassium salt, together with three common surfactants: sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and sodium 1-heptanesulfonate (SHS). The interactions were systematically characterized by zeta potential measurement, dynamic light scattering, negative-stain transmission electron microscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Unmodified liposomes, calcein-loaded liposomes, and Laurdan dye-embedded liposomes were all tested. By gradually increasing the temperature, the three PFCs and SHS decreased the leakage of calcein-loaded 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine liposomes, whereas SDS and CTAB increased the leakage. The PFCs that affected the lipid membranes stronger than SHS were attributable to their perfluoroalkyl carbon chains. Packing of the lipids was further studied using Laurdan dye as a probe. Calcein leakage tests also indicated that PFCs inhibited lipid membrane leakage induced by inorganic nanoparticles such as silica and gold nanoparticles. This study confirmed the similar effect of the PFCs as cholesterol in affecting membrane properties and would be helpful for understanding the interaction mechanism of PFCs and cell membranes. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,,,American Chemical Society,24701343,,,,English,ACS Omega,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056572371,

CHOICE (which stands for Connecting, Honouring dignity, Offering support, supporting Identity, Creating opportunities, and Enjoyment) is a multi-component intervention to improve relationship-centred care (RCC) and overall mealtime experience for residents. The objective of this developmental evaluation was to determine: a) if the dining experience (e.g. physical, social and RCC practices) could be modified with the CHOICE Program, and b) how program components needed to be adapted and/or if new components were required. Methods: A mixed methods study conducted between April-November 2016 included two home areas (64 residents; 25 care staff/home management) within a single LTC home in Ontario. Mealtime Scan (MTS), which measures mealtime experience at the level of the dining room, was used to evaluate the effectiveness of CHOICE implementation at four time points. Change in physical, social, RCC dining environment ratings and overall quality of the mealtime experience over time was determined with linear mixed-effects analyses (i.e., repeated measures). Semi-structured interviews (n = 9) were conducted with home staff to identify what components of the intervention worked well and what improvements could be made. Results: Physical and overall mealtime environment ratings showed improvement over time in both areas; one home area also improved social ratings (p < 0.05). Interviews revealed in-depth insights into the program and implementation process: i) Knowing the context and culture to meet staff and resident needs; ii) Getting everyone on board, including management; iii) Keeping communication lines open throughout the process; iv) Sharing responsibility and accountability for mealtime goals and challenges; v) Empowering and supporting staff's creative mealtime initiatives. Conclusions: This developmental evaluation demonstrated the potential value of CHOICE. Findings suggest a need to: extend the time to tailor program components; empower home staff in change management; and provide increased coaching. © 2018 The Author(s).",Complex intervention implementation; Dining; Evaluation; Implementation science; Long-term care; Mealtimes; Personal support workers; Program development; Relationship-centred care; Residential care,adult; article; change management; clinical article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; female; human; long term care; male; Ontario; program development; resident; residential care; responsibility; semi structured interview; social interaction; staff; worker,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712318,,,30424725,English,BMC Geriatr.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056552489,

Its cleavage activity selectively requires Ag+ ions, and thus it has been used as a sensor for Ag+ detection. However, the previous selection yielded very limited information regarding its sequence requirement, since only ?0.1% of the population in the final library were related to Ag10c and most other sequences were inactive. In this work, we performed a reselection by randomizing the 19 important nucleotides in Ag10c in such a way that a purine has an equal chance of being A or G, whereas a pyrimidine has an equal chance of being T or C. The round 3 library of the reselection was carefully analyzed and a statistic understanding of the relative importance of each nucleotide was obtained. At the same time, a more active mutant was identified, containing two mutated nucleotides. Further analysis indicated new base pairs leading to an enzyme with smaller catalytic loops but with ?200% activity of the original Ag10c, and also excellent selectivity for Ag+. Therefore, a more active mutant of Ag10c was obtained and further truncations were successfully performed, which might be better candidates for developing new biosensors for silver. A deeper biochemical understanding was also obtained using this reselection method. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,,,American Chemical Society,24701343,,,,English,ACS Omega,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056434802,

We describe overall change in prevalence of tobacco product use and within-person transitions in tobacco product use in the U.S. between 20132014 and 20142015 for young adults (1824 years) and older adults (25+ years). Data from Wave 1 (W1, 20132014) and Wave 2 (W2, 20142015) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study were analyzed (N = 34,235). Tobacco product types were categorized into: (1) combustible (cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah), (2) noncombustible (smokeless tobacco, snus pouches, dissolvable tobacco), and (3) electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Transitions for individual combustible-product types, and for single-and multiple-product use, were also considered. Overall prevalence of current tobacco use decreased from 27.6% to 26.3%. Among W1 non-tobacco users, 88.7% of young adults and 95.8% of older adults were non-tobacco users at W2. Among W1 tobacco users, 71.7% of young adults transitioned, with 20.7% discontinuing use completely, and 45.9% of older adults transitioned, with 12.5% discontinuing use completely. Continuing with/transitioning toward combustible product(s), particularly cigarettes, was more common than continuing with/transitioning toward ENDS. Tobacco use behaviors were less stable among young adults than older adults, likely reflecting greater product experimentation among young adults. Relative stability of cigarette use compared to other tobacco products (except older adult noncombustible use) demonstrates high abuse liability for cigarettes. © 2018 by the authors.

This study aimed to identify the differences of health states of rural residents in a lower middle income setting in China and its associated factors. Methods: A descriptive study of a stratified random sample of 3870 individuals was conducted in rural Anhui during 2015. We investigated the influence of five independent variables: individual demographic characteristics, family factors, social capital traits, physical health conditions and healthy lifestyle habits of participants who self-related their health as good. A chi-square test and ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to identify the relationship of these variables and self-rated health. Results: The study found that respondents who negatively rated their health often were female, elderly, poor, lived alone, had low levels of education, inadequate social support, poor physical health, used healthcare services and lived in the lower economic regions. We found no significant correlations between self-rated health and employment, marital status, medical insurance, or exercise frequency. Surprisingly, smoking and drinking also seemed to be unrelated to poor self-reported health. Conclusion: Health differences based on region were apparent in rural China. We highlighted the possible impacts of income, age, physical health, education, advanced age, and social support on health.

Unlike the existing techniques, in this paper, we propose a very lightweight single-time user identification technique that can ensure a unique authentication by presenting a system near-to-impossible to breach for intruders. Here, we have conducted a thorough study over single-time usage data collected from 33 users. The study reveals several new findings, which in turn, leads us to a novel solution exploiting a new machine learning technique. Our evaluation confirms that the proposed solution operates with only 5% False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and only 6% False Rejection Rate (FRR) over the data collected from 33 users. We further evaluate the performance through comparing its performance with some existing machine learning techniques. Finally, we perform a real implementation of our proposed solution as a mobile application to conduct a rigorous user evaluation over 27 participants using three different devices in order to show how the solution works in practical situations. Outcomes of the user evaluation demonstrate as low as 0% FAR after letting intruders to mimic the actual user, which ensures extremely low probability of being breached. Moreover, we let 2 users to continuously use our application over 25 days in different states during their operation. Outcomes of this evaluation demonstrate as low as 1% FRR confirming the usability of our technique in long-term usage. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Behavioral biometrics; Mean-SD clustering; Security; Smartphone,Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Ubiquitous computing; Behavioral biometrics; False acceptance rate; False rejection rate; Machine learning techniques; Mean-SD clustering; Security; Sensitive informations; Smart mobile devices; Mobile security,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Part of this disconnect is attributed to the exclusion of knowledge users at the outset of a study, which often results in the generation of knowledge that is not usable at the point of care. Integrated knowledge translation blended with qualitative methodologies has the potential to address this issue by working alongside knowledge users throughout the research process. Nevertheless, there is currently a paucity of literature about how integrated knowledge translation can be integrated into qualitative methodology; herein, we begin to address this gap in methodology discourse. The purpose of this paper is to describe our experience of conducting a focused ethnography with a collaborative integrated knowledge translation approach, including the synergies and potential sources of discord between integrated knowledge translation and focused ethnography. Methods: We describe the specific characteristics and synergies that exist when using an integrated knowledge translation approach with focused ethnography, using a research exemplar about the experiences of frail, older adults undergoing a transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Results: Embedding integrated knowledge translation within focused ethnography resulted in (1) an increased focus on the culture and values of the context under study, (2) a higher level of engagement among researchers, study participants and knowledge users, and (3) a commitment to partnership between researchers and knowledge users as part of a larger programme of research, resulting in a (4) greater emphasis on the importance of reciprocity and trustworthiness in the research process. Conclusions: Engaging in integrated knowledge translation from the outset of a study ensures that research findings are relevant for application at the point of care. The integration of integrated knowledge translation within focused ethnography allows for real-time uptake of meaningful and emerging findings, the strengthening of collaborative research teams, and opportunities for sustained programmes of research and relationships in the field of health services research. Further exploration of the integration of knowledge translation approaches with qualitative methodologies is recommended. © 2018 The Author(s).",focused ethnography; health services; integrated knowledge translation; knowledge user; patient experience; qualitative methodology; transcatheter aortic valve implantation,"aged; article; embedding; ethnography; health science; health services research; human; public health; scientist; transcatheter aortic valve implantation; caregiver; cooperation; cultural anthropology; family; health care delivery; health service; health services research; knowledge; methodology; patient participation; stakeholder engagement; translational research; Aged; Anthropology, Cultural; Caregivers; Cooperative Behavior; Delivery of Health Care; Family; Health Services; Health Services Research; Humans; Knowledge; Patient Participation; Research Design; Stakeholder Participation; Translational Medical Research",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14784505,,,30390696,English,Health Res.

Adults from Canada, the US, Australia, and the UK completed an online survey (n = 11,617). Respondents were randomized to view cereal boxes displaying one of 11 FOP label conditions for high levels of sugar and saturated fat: control (no FOP symbol), red circle, red stop sign, magnifying glass, magnifying glass + exclamation mark, and caution triangle + exclamation mark, plus each of these five conditions accompanied by a high in text descriptor. Participants identified the amount of saturated fat and sugar in the product (low/moderate/high). Participants were more likely to correctly identify the product as high in saturated fat or sugar when shown the stop sign, triangle + exclamation mark, red circle, or magnifying glass + exclamation mark symbols incorporating high in text (p < 0.01). The magnifying glass was the least effective symbol. The stop sign (37.7%) and triangle + exclamation mark (22.0%) were most frequently selected as the best symbol for indicating high nutrient amounts. Overall, FOP labels with high in descriptions, red color and intuitive warning symbols (e.g., stop signs, exclamation marks, caution triangles) were more effective at communicating high levels of nutrients of public health concern in a time-limited environment. © 2018 by the authors.

This paper presents the design, integration, and testing of a simple, self-contained, low-power, non-invasive system at low cost applicable for such purpose. The system is powered by piezoelectric energy harvesters (EHs) based on PZT and includes a microcontroller unit (MCU) and a central hub. Real-time information regarding the electricity consumption is measured and communicated by the system, which ultimately offers a dependable and promising solution as a wireless sensor node. The dynamic power management ensures the system to work with different types of PZT EHs at a wide range of input power. Thus, the system is robust against fluctuation of the current in the electricity grid and requires minimum adjustment if EH unit requires exchange or upgrade. Experimental results demonstrate that this unit is in a position to read and transmit 60 Hz alternating current (AC) sensor signals with a high accuracy no less than 91.4%. The system is able to achieve an operation duty cycle from <1 min up to 18 min when the current in an electric wire varies from 7.6 A to 30 A, depending on the characteristics of different EHs and intensity of current being monitored. © 2018 by the authors.

In particular, the classification of infections among the subtypes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a routine component of clinical management, and there are now many classification algorithms available for this purpose. Although several of these algorithms are similar in accuracy and speed, the majority are proprietary and require laboratories to transmit HIV-1 sequence data over the network to remote servers. This potentially exposes sensitive patient data to unauthorized access, and makes it impossible to determine how classifications are made and to maintain the data provenance of clinical bioinformatic workflows. We propose an open-source supervised and alignment-free subtyping method (KAMERIS) that operates on k-mer frequencies in HIV-1 sequences. We performed a detailed study of the accuracy and performance of subtype classification in comparison to four state-of-the-art programs. Based on our testing data set of manually curated real-world HIV-1 sequences (n = 2, 784), KAMERIS obtained an overall accuracy of 97%, which matches or exceeds all other tested software, with a processing rate of over 1, 500 sequences per second. Furthermore, our fully standalone general-purpose software provides key advantages in terms of data security and privacy, transparency and reproducibility. Finally, we show that our method is readily adaptable to subtype classification of other viruses including dengue, influenza A, and hepatitis B and C virus. © 2018 Solis-Reyes et al.

Many researchers have postulated that human motor control can be mathematically represented using optimal control theories, whereby some cost function is effectively maximized or minimized. However, such abilities are compromised in stroke patients. In this study, to promote rehabilitation of the stroke patient, a rehabilitation robot has been developed using optimal control theory. Despite numerous studies of control strategies for rehabilitation, there is a limited number of rehabilitation robots using optimal control theory. The main idea of this work is to show that impedance control gains cannot be kept constant for optimal performance of the robot using a feedback linearization approach. Hence, a general method for the real-time and optimal impedance control of an end-effector-based rehabilitation robot is proposed. The controller is developed for a 2 degree-of-freedom upper extremity stroke rehabilitation robot, and compared to a feedback linearization approach that uses the standard optimal impedance derived from covariance propagation equations. The new method will assign optimal impedance gains at each configuration of the robot while performing a rehabilitation task. The proposed controller is a linear quadratic regulator mapped from the operational space to the joint space. Parameters of the two controllers have been tuned using a unified biomechatronic model of the human and robot. The performances of the controllers were compared while operating the robot under four conditions of human movements (impaired, healthy, delayed, and time-advanced) along a reference trajectory, both in simulations and experiments. Despite the idealized and approximate nature of the human-robot model, the proposed controller worked well in experiments. Simulation and experimental results with the two controllers showed that, compared to the standard optimal controller, the rehabilitation system with the proposed optimal controller is assisting more in the active-assist therapy while resisting in active-constrained case. Furthermore, in passive therapy, the proposed optimal controller maintains the position error and interaction forces in safer regions. This is the result of updating the impedance in the operational space using a linear time-variant impedance model. © 2018 Ghannadi, Sharif Razavian and McPhee.",Human robot interaction; Linear quadratic regulator; Operational space; Optimal impedance control; Rehabilitation manipulandum; Stroke rehabilitation,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,22969144,,,,English,Front.

Accounting for the vast interindividual variability in cybersickness forms a pivotal step in solving the issue. Most studies of cybersickness focus on a single factor (e.g., balance, sex, or vection), while other contributors are overlooked. Here, we characterize the complex relationship between cybersickness and several measures of sensorimotor processing. In a single session, we conducted a battery of tests of balance control, vection responses, and vestibular sensitivity to self-motion. Following this, we measured cybersickness after VR exposure. We constructed a principal components regression model using the measures of sensorimotor processing. The model significantly predicted 37% of the variability in cybersickness measures, with 16% of this variance being accounted for by a principal component that represented balance control measures. The strongest predictor was participants sway path length during vection, which was inversely related to cybersickness [r(28) =-0.53, P = 0.002] and uniquely accounted for 7.5% of the variance in cybersickness scores across participants. Vection strength reports and measures of vestibular sensitivity were not significant predictors of cybersickness. We discuss the possible role of sensory reweighting in cybersickness that is suggested by these results, and we identify other factors that may account for the remaining variance in cybersickness. The results reiterate that the relationship between balance control and cybersickness is anything but straightforward. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The advent of consumer virtual reality provides a pressing need for interventions that combat sickness in simulated environments (cybersickness). This research builds on multiple theories of cybersickness etiology to develop a predictive model that distinguishes between individuals who are/are not likely to experience cybersickness. In the future this approach can be adapted to provide virtual reality users with curated content recommendations based on more efficient measurements of sensorimotor processing. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

The results of the review demonstrated that there exist many gaps in the literature regarding comprehensive optometric-specific infection control guidelines. Further research regarding appropriate handwashing methods, equipment disinfection techniques, extent and breadth of staff training and indications for use of personal protective equipment is required to better understand what precautions must be taken in an optometric setting when encountering patients with MRSA. © 2018 Optometry Australia",guidelines; infection control; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; optometry,,,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,8164622,,CEOPE,29572957,English,Clin.

Here, we revisit the problem of computing the inner edit distance of a regular language given via a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA). This problem relates to the inherent maximal error-detecting capability of the language in question. We present two efficient algorithms for solving this problem, both of which execute in time O(r2n2d), where r is the cardinality of the alphabet involved, n is the number of transitions in the given NFA, and d is the computed edit distance. We have implemented one of the two algorithms and present here a set of performance tests. The correctness of the algorithms is based on the connection between word distances and error detection and the fact that nondeterministic transducers can be used to represent the errors (resp., edit operations) involved in error-detection (resp., in word distances). © 2018 by the authors.",Algorithms; Automata; Complexity; Edit distance; Implementation; Regular language; Transducers,Algorithms; Finite automata; Formal languages; Pipeline processing systems; Problem solving; Transducers; Automata; Complexity; Data-communication; Edit distance; Implementation; Nondeterministic finite automaton; Performance tests; Synchronization error; Error detection,,MDPI AG,19994893,,,,English,Algorithms,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056848528,

The qubit is described by an Unruh-DeWitt detector model coupled quadratically to a scalar field and alternately to a fermion field. In the cycle, the qubit undergoes two stages of differing constant acceleration corresponding to thermal contact with a hot and cold reservoir. Explicit conditions are derived on the accelerations required for this cycle to have positive work output. By analytically calculating the detector response functions, we show that the dimensionality of the quadratic and fermionic coupling constants introduces qualitatively different behaviour of the work output from this cycle as compared to the case in which the qubit linearly couples to a scalar field. © 2018, The Author(s).",Black Holes; Thermal Field Theory,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

The Laurentian Great Lakes are the world's largest supply of freshwater and their ice cover has a major impact on regional weather and climate, ship navigation, and public safety. Ice experts at the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) have been manually producing operational Great Lakes image analysis charts based on visual interpretation of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In that regard, we have investigated the performance of the semi-automated segmentation algorithm ""glocal"" Iterative Region Growing with Semantics (IRGS) for lake ice classification using dual polarized RADARSAT-2 imagery acquired over Lake Erie. Analysis of various case studies indicated that the ""glocal"" IRGS algorithm could provide a reliable ice-water classification using dual polarized images with a high overall accuracy of 90.4%. However, lake ice types that are based on stage of development were not effectively identified due to the ambiguous relation between backscatter and ice types. The slight improvement of using dual-pol as opposed to single-pol images for ice-water discrimination was also demonstrated. © 2018 by the authors.",Classification; Lake ice; RADARSAT-2; Synthetic aperture radar,Automation; Classification (of information); Image analysis; Image classification; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Lakes; Semantics; Synthetic aperture radar; Analysis of various; Canadian Ice Services; High-latitude regions; Laurentian Great Lakes; Radarsat-2; Semi-automated segmentation; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Visual interpretation; Ice,,MDPI AG,20724292,,,,English,Remote Sens.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057086302,

Starting from what Svein Jentoft has had to say about the topic, we explore the idea that viable fishing communities require viable fish stocks, and viable fish stocks require viable fishing communities. To elaborate and expand on Jentofts arguments, first, we discuss values as a key attribute of communities that confer the ability to manage coastal resources. Turning to power, next we explore why fishing communities need to be empowered by having the opportunity to self-manage or co-manage resources. Third, regarding community viability, we make the argument that (1) rebuilding or maintaining viable fishing communities and fish stocks cannot succeed without first dealing with vulnerabilities, and that (2) the dimensions of vulnerability involve increase/decrease in well-being, better/poorer access to capitals, and building/losing resilience. The idea that healthy fishing communities and healthy fish stocks require one another implies a viable system that contains both, a social-ecological system view. The values embedded in communities enable them to manage resources. Thus, managers and policy makers need to imagine healthy fishing communities who take care of resources, and this positive image of communities is more likely than present policies to lead to viable fishing communities as well as viable fish stocks. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Community; Images; Power; Resilience; Small-scale fisheries; Social-ecological systems; Values; Vulnerability,ecosystem resilience; fishery management; fishing community; marine resource; resource management; small scale industry; valuation; vulnerability,,Springer Verlag,18727859,,,,English,Marit.

NetF, related to the ?-sheet pore-forming Leukocidin/Hemolysin superfamily, is considered a major virulence factor for this disease. The main purpose of this work is to demonstrate the pore-forming activity of NetF and characterize the chemical nature of its binding site. Electron microscopy using recombinant NetF (rNetF) confirmed that NetF is able to oligomerize and form large pores in equine ovarian (EO) cell membranes and sheep red blood cells. These oligomeric pores appear to be about 4-6 nm in diameter, and the number of oligomer subunits to vary from 6 to 9. Sodium periodate treatment rendered EO cells non-susceptible to NetF, suggesting that NetF binding requires cell surface carbohydrates. NetF cytotoxicity was also inhibited by a lectin that binds sialic acid, by sialidase, and by free sialic acid in excess, all of which clearly implicate sialic acid-containing membrane carbohydrates in NetF binding and/or toxicity for EO cells. Binding of NetF to sheep red blood cells was not inhibited by the gangliosides GM1, GM2 and GM3, nor did the latter promote membrane permeabilization in liposomes, suggesting that they do not constitute the cellular receptors. In contrast, treatment of EO cells with different proteases reduced their susceptibility to NetF, suggesting that the NetF receptor is a sialic acid-containing glycoprotein. © 2018 Mehdizadeh Gohari et al.

We investigate this transition for a general spherically-symmetric metric outside the shell and find that it occurs generically. Once the shell is null its persistence on a null trajectory can be ensured by several mechanisms that we describe. Using the outgoing Vaidya metric as an example we show that if a dust shell acquires surface pressure on its transition to a null trajectory it can evade the Schwarzschild radius through its collapse. Alternatively, the pressureless collapse may continue if the exterior geometry acquires a more general form. © 2018 The Author(s)",,,,Elsevier B.V.,5503213,,NUPBB,,English,Nucl. Phys.

Suppression in amblyopia may be an unequal form of normal interocular suppression or a distinct pathophysiology. To explore this issue, we examined the orientation tuning and contrast dependence of continuous flash suppression (CFS) in adults with amblyopia and visually normal controls. METHODS. Nine patients (mean age, 26.9 ± SD 4.7 years) and 11 controls (mean age, 24.8 ± SD 5.3 years) participated. In the CFS paradigm, spatially one-dimensional noise refreshing at 10 Hz was displayed in one eye to induce suppression of the other eye, and suppression strength was measured by using a grating contrast increment detection task. In experiment 1, noise contrast was fixed and the orientation difference between the noise and the grating was varied. In experiment 2, noise and grating orientations were identical and noise contrast was varied. RESULTS. Suppression patterns varied in both groups. In experiment 1, controls showed consistently orientation-tuned CFS (mean half-height bandwidth, 35.88 ± SD 21.58) with near-equal strength between eyes. Five of nine patients with amblyopia exhibited orientation-independent CFS. Eight patients had markedly unequal suppression between eyes. Experiment 2 found that increasing the noise contrast to the amblyopic eye may produce suppression of the fellow eye, but suppression remained unequal between eyes. CONCLUSIONS. Our data revealed that orientation specificity in CFS was very broad or absent in some patients with amblyopia, which could not be predicted by clinical measures. Suppression was unbalanced across the entire contrast range for most patients. This suggests that abnormal early visual experience disrupts the development of interocular suppression mechanisms. © 2018 The Authors.",Amblyopia; Continuous flash suppression; Interocular suppression; Psychophysics,"adult; amblyopia; analysis of variance; Article; binocular vision; blood patch; clinical article; contrast enhancement; controlled study; disease severity assessment; eye refraction; female; human; interocular transfer; male; middle aged; molecular pathology; performance; priority journal; psychophysics; refraction error; retinoscopy; spatiotemporal analysis; task performance; tuning curve; vision; visual acuity; visual orientation; young adult; amblyopia; contrast sensitivity; eye dominance; orientation; pathophysiology; perceptive threshold; photostimulation; physiology; strabismus; Adult; Amblyopia; Contrast Sensitivity; Dominance, Ocular; Female; Humans; Male; Orientation; Photic Stimulation; Sensory Thresholds; Strabismus; Vision, Binocular; Young Adult",,Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.,1460404,,IOVSD,30452600,English,Invest.

METHODS: In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, 15 primary care practices were randomly assigned to 1 of the following active-treatment conditions: OMSC or OMSC plus performance coaching (OMSC+). All practices received support to implement the OMSC. In addition, clinicians in the OMSC+ group participated in a 1.5-hour skills-based coaching session and received an individualized performance report. All clinicians and a cross-sectional sample of their patients were surveyed before and 4 months after introduction of the interventions. The primary outcome measure was rates of tobacco-dependence treatment strategy (Ask, Advise, Assist, Arrange) delivery. Secondary outcomes were patient quit attempts and smoking abstinence measured at 6 months' follow-up. RESULTS: Primary care clinicians (166) and patients (1,990) were enrolled in the trial. Clinicians in the OMSC+ group had statistically greater rates of delivery for Ask (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.69; 95% CI, 1.05-2.72), Assist (AOR = 1.64; 95% CI, 1.08-2.49), and Arrange (AOR = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.22-3.31). Sensitivity analysis found that the rate of delivery for Advise was greater only among those clinicians who attended the coaching session (AOR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.10-2.49; P = .02). No differences were documented between groups for cessation outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Performance coaching significantly increased rates of tobacco-dependence treatment by primary care clinicians when delivered as part of a multicomponent intervention. © 2018 Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.",audit and feedback; coaching; knowledge translation; Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation; primary care; quality improvement; randomized controlled trial; smoking cessation,,,NLM (Medline),15441717,,,30420364,English,Ann Fam Med,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056328826,

Objective This meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effect of HP intakes on kidney function in healthy adults. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials comparing HP (?1.5 g/kg body weight or ?20% energy intake or ?100 g protein/d) with normal- or lower-protein (NLP; ?5% less energy intake from protein/d compared with HP group) intakes on kidney function. Medline and EMBASE databases were searched. Randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of HP with NLP (>4 d duration) intakes on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in adults without kidney disease were included. Results A total of 2144 abstracts were reviewed, with 40 articles selected for full-text review; 28 of these were analyzed and included data from 1358 participants. Data were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis (RevMan 5; The Cochrane Collaboration), meta-regression (STATA; StataCorp), and dose-response analysis (Prism; GraphPad). Analyses were conducted using postintervention (post) GFR and the change in GFR from preintervention to post. The post-only comparison showed a trivial effect for GFR to be higher after HP intakes [standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.19; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.31; P = 0.002]. The change in GFR did not differ between interventions (SMD: 0.11; 95% CI: -0.05, 0.27; P = 0.16). There was a linear relation between protein intake and GFR in the post-only comparison (r = 0.332, P = 0.03), but not between protein intake and the change in GFR (r = 0.184, P = 0.33). The main limitation of the current analysis is the unclear risk of selection bias of the included trials. Conclusions Postintervention GFR comparisons indicate that HP diets result in higher GFRs; however, when changes in GFR were compared, dietary protein had no effect. Our analysis indicates that HP intakes do not adversely influence kidney function on GFR in healthy adults. © 2018 American Society for Nutrition.",chronic kidney disease; GFR; glomerular filtration rate; meta-analysis; protein; renal failure,"Article; body weight; caloric intake; carbohydrate intake; diet therapy; Embase; energy balance; fat intake; glomerulus filtration rate; health status; human; kidney function; Medline; protein diet; protein intake; systematic review; administration and dosage; adult; drug effect; meta analysis; protein intake; protein restriction; Adult; Diet, Protein-Restricted; Dietary Proteins; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans",,Oxford University Press,223166,,JONUA,30383278,English,J.

Thematic analysis of the literature identified 11 barriers: (i) Lack of time; (ii) Lack of resources; (iii) Lack of communication; (iv) Lack of management support, commitment, and participation; (v) Lack of knowledge and training; (vi) Resistance to change; (vii) Changing work environment; (viii) Scope of activities; (ix) Lack of trust, fear of job loss, or loss of authority; (x) Process deficiencies; and (xi) Difficulty of implementing controls. Three facilitators identified were: (i) Training, knowledge and ergonomists support; (ii) Communication, participation and support; and (iii) An effective implementation process. The barriers and facilitators identified were similar to those in general OHS processes.

However, these assessments often do not explore the potential health risks of climate change far outside the range of recent experience with extreme weather events and other climate-related hazards. Climate and health stress tests are designed to increase the capacity of health systems and related sectors to manage potentially disruptive climate-related shocks and stresses. Stress tests focus on hypothetical scenarios, during which it would be difficult for the health system to maintain its essential function of providing services to protect population health. The stress test explores approaches to effectively manage acute and chronic climate-related events and conditions that could directly impact health systems, and climate-related events in non-health sectors that can indirectly impact health outcomes and/or health system function. We provide detailed methods and guidance for conducting climate and health stress tests, centering on three primary activities: (1) preparing and scoping the stress test; (2) successfully conducting the stress test; and (3) communicating the results to key stakeholders to facilitate policy and programmatic reforms. © 2018 by the authors.

Objectives: The objectives for this study were to examine the prevalence of polypharmacy for people with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) following injury and to determine risk factors. Setting: Ontario, Canada Methods: We used provincial-level administrative health services data of publicly funded healthcare encounters housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario. We examined prescription medications dispensed over a 1 year period post injury for persons 66+ years with an index traumatic SCI between 2004 and 2014. Polypharmacy was defined as being on 10 or more drug classes. Descriptive and analytical statistics were conducted. Relative risks and 95% confidence limits for factors related to polypharmacy were calculated using a robust Poisson multivariate regression model. Results: We identified 418 cases of persons with traumatic SCI during the observation window. A total of 233 patients (56%) were taking at least 10 drug classes in the year following discharge from care for traumatic SCI. The mean number of drug classes taken post injury was 11 (SD = 6). Continuity of care was significantly associated with polypharmacy, with a higher continuity of care (having at least 75% of visits with the same doctor) reducing the risk of polypharmacy. The most common drugs prescribed were laxatives, opioids and cardiovascular-related drugs. Conclusion: Findings suggest that polypharmacy is extensive among older adults with traumatic SCI.

The Global Matrix 3.0 of Report Card grades on physical activity was developed to achieve a better understanding of the global variation in child and youth physical activity and associated supports. Methods: Work groups from 49 countries followed harmonized procedures to develop their Report Cards by grading 10 common indicators using the best available data. The participating countries were divided into 3 categories using the United Nations' human development index (HDI) classification (low or medium, high, and very high HDI). Results: A total of 490 grades, including 369 letter grades and 121 incomplete grades, were assigned by the 49 work groups. Overall, an average grade of ""C-,"" ""D+,"" and ""C-"" was obtained for the low and medium HDI countries, high HDI countries, and very high HDI countries, respectively. Conclusions: The present study provides rich new evidence showing that the situation regarding the physical activity of children and youth is a concern worldwide. Strategic public investments to implement effective interventions to increase physical activity opportunities are needed. © 2018 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Active transportation; Global comparison; Health promotion; International; Sedentary behavior; Sport,"article; case report; child; clinical article; female; health promotion; human; human development; human experiment; investment; juvenile; male; physical activity; sport; United Nations; adolescent; clinical trial; exercise; health promotion; multicenter study; preschool child; procedures; psychology; research; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Exercise; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Research Report",,Human Kinetics Publishers Inc.,15433080,,,30475137,English,J.

These ZnO@MFCNC hybrid nanostructures were evaluated for their in vitro sun protection factor performance and photocatalytic activity under simulated UV and solar radiation. The photodegradation kinetics of a model pigment (methylene blue) was fitted to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. A 4-fold increase in the photocatalytic activity of ZnO@MFCNCs was observed when compared to pure ZnO. This is associated with (i) increased specific surface area provided by the MFCNC template, (ii) confined surface energy and controlled growth of ZnO nanoparticles, and (iii) entrapment of photoinduced charge carriers in the pores of the core-shell MFCNC rod, followed by fast promotion of interfacial e-charge transfer to the surface of the catalyst. The present study demonstrates how an increase in photocatalytic activity can be engineered without the introduction of structural defects or band gap tailoring of the semiconductor. The aqueous-based ZnO@MFCNC hybrid system displayed attractive UV-absorption and photocatalytic characteristics, offering the conversion of this renewable and sustainable technology into intelligent cosmetic formulations. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.",,,,American Chemical Society,24701343,,,,English,ACS Omega,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054299924,

We also define efficient protocols for controlling and manipulating the lattice characteristics. These protocols are applied in an experimental realization of a lattice of optical spin-orbit beams. The novel passive devices we demonstrate here are also a natural alternative to existing methods for producing single-axis OAM and spin-orbit beams. Our techniques provide new tools for investigations of chiral and topological materials with light and particle beams. © 2018 authors.

Our research proposes that goal regulation in the workplace may have consequences for creativity. While there is an increasing trend for organizations and workers to visualize the structure of their goals (e.g., management hierarchy, concept-map, flowchart), prior research suggests the visualization approaches differ as one of the three types: hierarchical, network, and sequential models. Because a network model (vs. hierarchical and sequential models) highlights multiple connections between goals and reveals unobvious connections between them, we hypothesized that the use of a network goal model might increase people's ability to integrate seemingly unrelated ideas, even on subsequent unrelated tasks, leading to higher (convergent) creative performance. To test the hypothesis, we conducted an experiment in 2017 manipulating participants' goal models (hierarchical, network, sequential; N = 191, median age = 19) and measured their creativity. Results suggest that those in the network model condition performed better in the kind of creativity task that requires meaningful integration of unrelated ideas (i.e., convergent creativity); in contrast, there was no difference between goal model conditions on divergent creative performance. These findings thus illuminate how goal models may influence creativity, providing new insights into situational inductions that can boost creative performance.

The effects of tonal and broadband acoustic excitation are considered since such acoustic emissions commonly result from airfoil self-noise and can influence flow development via a feedback loop. This interdependence is decoupled, and the problem is studied in a controlled manner through the use of an external acoustic source. The flow field is assessed using time-resolved, two-component particle image velocimetry, the results of which show that, for equivalent energy input levels, tonal and broadband excitation can produce equivalent changes in the mean separation bubble topology. These changes in topology result from the influence of excitation on transition and the subsequent development of coherent structures in the bubble. Both tonal and broadband excitation lead to earlier shear layer roll-up and thus reduce the bubble size and advance mean reattachment upstream, while the shed vortices tend to persist farther downstream of mean reattachment in the case of tonal excitation. Through a cross-examination of linear stability theory (LST) predictions and measured disturbance characteristics, nonlinear disturbance interactions are shown to play a crucial role in the transition process, leading to significantly different disturbance development for the tonal and broadband excited flows. Specifically, tonal excitation results in transition being dominated by the excited mode, which grows in strong accordance with linear theory and damps the growth of all other disturbances. On the other hand, disturbance amplitudes are more moderate for the natural and broadband excited flows, and so all unstable disturbances initially grow in accordance with LST. For all cases, a rapid redistribution of perturbation energy to a broad range of frequencies follows, with the phenomenon occurring earliest for the broadband excitation case. By taking nonlinear effects into consideration, important ramifications are made clear in regards to comparing LST predictions and experimental or numerical results, thus explaining the trends reported in recent investigations. These findings offer new insights into the influence of tonal and broadband noise emissions, resulting from airfoil self-noise or otherwise, on transition and flow development within a separation bubble. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.",aeroacoustics; boundary layer separation; transition to turbulence,Acoustic emission testing; Acoustic wave transmission; Aeroacoustics; Airfoils; Boundary layers; Topology; Turbulent flow; Velocity measurement; Boundary-layer separation; Broadband excitation; Disturbance amplitudes; Linear stability theory; Measured disturbances; Nonlinear disturbance; Transition to turbulence; Two-component particles; Acoustic noise; acoustic wave; aerodynamics; boundary layer; bubble; separation; transient flow; turbulent flow,,Cambridge University Press,221120,,JFLSA,,English,J.

These communities need reliable and sustainable electricity to address social, environmental and economic development issues. The study examines the diffusion of RETs during the 2000-2016 period, identifies the systemic and transformational failures responsible for the functional performance of the TISs, and generates insights about factors that have the potential to sustain the development of RET projects. Findings suggest that the TIS-proposed causal mechanisms were present and performed as expected. Since the accumulation of TIS functions influences the rate of deployment of renewable technologies, policy intervention to improve local learning and networking could lead to accelerated diffusion of RETs to the benefit of remote communities and other stakeholders. © 2018 by the authors.",Remote indigenous communities; Renewable energy; Sustainable electricity systems; Technological innovation system,alternative energy; economic development; electricity generation; indigenous population; innovation; stakeholder; sustainability; technological development; Canada; Northwest Territories; Ontario [Canada],,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055519091,

Allochthonous OC loads from the landscape, along with autochthonous OC loads from primary production, are mineralized in lakes, buried in lake sediments, and exported via surface or groundwater outflows. Although these processes provide a basis for a conceptual understanding of lake OC budgets, few studies have integrated these fluxes under a dynamic modeling framework to examine their interactions and relative magnitudes. We developed a simple, dynamic mass balance model for OC, and applied the model to a set of five lakes. We examined the relative magnitudes of OC fluxes and found that long-term (>10 year) lake OC dynamics were predominantly driven by allochthonous loads in four of the five lakes, underscoring the importance of terrestrially-derived OC in northern lake ecosystems. Our model highlighted seasonal patterns in lake OC budgets, with increasing water temperatures and lake productivity throughout the growing season corresponding to a transition from burial- to respiration-dominated OC fates. Ratios of respiration to burial, however, were also mediated by the source (autochthonous vs. allochthonous) of total OC loads. Autochthonous OC is more readily respired and may therefore proportionally reduce burial under a warming climate, but allochthonous OC may increase burial due to changes in precipitation. The ratios of autochthonous to allochthonous inputs and respiration to burial demonstrate the importance of dynamic models for examining both the seasonal and inter-annual roles of lakes in landscape and global carbon cycling, particularly in a global change context. Finally, we highlighted critical data needs, which include surface water DOC observations in paired tributary and lake systems, measurements of OC burial rates, groundwater input volume and DOC, and budgets of particulate OC. © 2018 The Authors",Carbon cycle; Dissolved organic carbon; GLEON; LTER; Mass balance; Particulate organic carbon,Budget control; Ecosystems; Groundwater; Organic carbon; Carbon cycles; Dissolved organic carbon; GLEON; LTER; Mass balance; Particulate organic carbon; Lakes; carbon cycle; conceptual framework; dissolved organic matter; global change; growing season; lacustrine environment; lake water; mass balance; particulate organic matter; seasonal variation; surface water,,Elsevier B.V.,3043800,,ECMOD,,English,Ecol.

Yet, there are few reports in the literature that describe how results are summarised, shared and used. This paper aims to inform knowledge translation (KT) for realist reviews by describing the process of developing a KT strategy for a review on pathways for scaling up complex public health interventions. Methods: The participatory approach used for the realist review was also used to develop the KT strategy. The approach included three main steps, namely (1) an international meeting focused on interpreting preliminary findings from the realist review and seeking input on KT activities; (2) a targeted literature review on KT for realist reviews; and (3) consultations with primary knowledge users of the review. Results: The international meeting identified a general preference among knowledge users for findings from the review that are action oriented. A need was also identified for understanding how to tailor findings for specific knowledge user groups in relation to their needs. The literature review identified four papers that included brief descriptions of planned or actual KT activities for specific research studies; however, information was minimal on what KT activities or products work for whom, under what conditions and why. The consultations revealed that KT for realist reviews should consider the following: (1) activities closely aligned with the preferences of specific knowledge user groups; (2) key findings that are sensitive to factors within the knowledge user's context; and (3) actionable statements that can advance KT goals, activities or products. The KT strategy derived from the three activities includes a planning framework and tailored KT activities that address preferences of knowledge users for findings that are action oriented and context relevant. Conclusions: This paper provides an example of a KT strategy for realist reviews that blends theoretical and practical insights. Evaluation of the strategy's implementation will provide useful insights on its effectiveness and potential for broader application. © 2018 The Author(s).",chronic disease prevention; complex interventions; evidence-informed decision-making; knowledge translation; population health; public health; realist reviews; scaling up; system planning,Article; attitude to health; clinical effectiveness; consultation; health care planning; health care system; human; intersectoral collaboration; knowledge translation; medical research; participatory research; peer review; process development; theoretical study; decision making; evidence based medicine; health care delivery; health care planning; knowledge; literature; methodology; population health; problem solving; public health; stakeholder engagement; translational research; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Evidence-Based Medicine; Health Planning; Humans; Knowledge; Population Health; Problem Solving; Public Health; Research Design; Review Literature as Topic; Stakeholder Participation; Translational Medical Research,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14784505,,,30348180,English,Health Res.

As a result, it constitutes a useful platform to benchmark theoretical calculations of exchange interactions in insulating Yb3+ magnets. Here we study Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 at low temperatures in applied magnetic fields as a further probe of the physics of this model system. Experimentally, we consider the behavior of polycrystalline samples of Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 with a combination of inelastic neutron scattering and heat capacity measurements down to 75 mK and up to fields of 10 T. Consistent with previous work, inelastic neutron scattering finds a level crossing near 3 T, but no significant dispersion of the spin excitations is detected up to the highest applied fields. Refinement of the theoretical model previously determined at zero field can reproduce much of the inelastic neutron scattering spectra and specific heat data. A notable exception is a low temperature peak in the specific heat at ?0.1 K. This may indicate the scale of interactions between tetrahedra or may reflect undetected disorder in Ba3Yb2Zn5O11. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.",anisotropic exchange; breathing pyrochlore; inelastic neutron scattering; Pyrochlore,Barium compounds; Crystal lattices; Inelastic neutron scattering; Magnetic fields; Specific heat; Temperature; Zinc compounds; Anisotropic exchange; Applied magnetic fields; Heat capacity measurements; Polycrystalline samples; Pyrochlore compounds; Pyrochlores; Theoretical calculations; Theoretical modeling; Ytterbium compounds,,Institute of Physics Publishing,9538984,,JCOME,30256218,English,J Phys Condens Matter,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055602162,

The strategic assessment is immediately needed to provide project-level guidance for decision makers who will be required under new federal legislation to consider the extent to which each assessed project ""contributes to sustainability"" and ""hinders or contributes to"" meeting Canada's climate commitments. However, Canada, like many other countries, has not yet translated its Paris Agreement climate commitments into an adequate suite of specific policies, pathways, budgets, and other directives for compliance. Consequently, the climate commitments' strategic assessment will need to play a fully strategic role-in policy development as well as policy interpretation and elaboration for assessment purposes. This paper outlines the key considerations and required steps for a strategic assessment that fills the policy gap between Paris and projects, and develops guidance centred on a suite of tests for evaluating proposed major projects that may have important effects on Canada's prospects for meeting its climate commitments. © 2018 by the authors.",Canada; Climate change; Impact assessment; Law; Mitigation; Paris Agreement; Project assessment climate policy; Strategic assessment,,,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055118251,

Participants were asked to complete four 24 h dietary recalls (24HRs) using the Automated Self-Administered 24-h Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24-Canada-2014), two SDQ administrations (prior to recalls one and four), and the System Usability Scale (SUS) for ASA24. For the SDQ administrations, Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ranged from 0.49 to 0.57 for nutrients and 0.35 to 0.72 for food groups. Mean intakes estimated from the SDQ were lower compared than those from the 24HRs. For nutrients, correlation coefficients were highest for fiber, calcium, and vitamin D (4564 years: 0.59, 0.50, 0.51; >65 years: 0.29, 0.38, 0.49, p < 0.01); Kappas ranged from 0.14 to 0.37 in those 4564 years and 0.17 to 0.32 in participants >65 years. Among the 70% who completed all recalls independently, the SUS indicated poor usability, though the majority reported feeling confident using ASA24. Overall, the SDQ captures intake with varying test-retest reliability and accuracy by nutrient and age. Further research is needed to inform use of a more comprehensive dietary measure in the CLSA. © 2018 by the authors.

Thraustochytrids are marine heterokonts that exhibit robust growth rates, high PUFA content, and more specifically, a large percentage of omega-3 fatty acids like docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) have been shown to improve the efficiency of organic solvent extraction of oils from wet oleaginous yeast and microalgae under mild conditions. Two ILs, the imidazolium 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate [C2mim][EtSO4] IL and the phosphonium (tetrabutylphosphonium propanoate [P4444][Prop]) IL were assessed for their ability to facilitate extraction of PUFA-containing lipids from a Thraustochytrium sp. (T18) through efficient cell wall disruption. The oil extracted after IL pretreatment was further characterized with respect to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition, while the effects of process parameters, such as the ratio of ionic liquid to co-solvent, the mass ratio of microalgae to the mixture of ionic liquid, and type of co-solvent were also investigated for both ILs. The results indicate that these ILs can disrupt the cells of Thraustochytrium sp. when mixed with a co-solvent (methanol), and facilitated the recovery of oils over a large degree of dewatered Thraustochytrium biomass (0-77.2 wt% water) in a short period of time (60 min) at ambient temperature, hence demonstrating a water compatible, low-energy, lipid recovery method. The lipid recovery was not affected by repeated usage of recycled ILs (tested up to five times). © 2018 by the authors.",Ionic liquids; Microalgae; Omega 3,Algae; Microorganisms; Mixtures; Organic solvents; Polyunsaturated fatty acids; Recovery; Solvent extraction; Docosahexaenoic acid; Fatty acid methyl ester; Ionic liquid (ils); Micro-algae; Omega-3; Omega-3-fatty acids; Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs); Process parameters; Ionic liquids,,MDPI AG,19961944,,,,English,Mater.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054970591,

Existing Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) tools provide modellers with little aid, partly because tool providers have not investigated users' difficulties through empirical investigations such as field studies. This paper presents the results of a two-phase user study to identify the most prominent difficulties that users might face when developing UML Class and State-Machine diagrams using UML modelling tools. In the first phase, we identified the preliminary modelling challenges by analysing 30 Class and State-Machine models that were previously developed by students as a course assignment. The result of the first phase helped us design the second phase of our user study where we empirically investigated different aspects of using modelling tools: the tools' effectiveness, users' efficiency, users' satisfaction, the gap between users' expectation and experience, and users' cognitive difficulties. Our results suggest that users' greatest difficulties are in (1) remembering contextual information and (2) identifying and fixing errors and inconsistencies. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The energy dissipation of the entire joint surface is estimated by energy loss equation of single micro-convex body. According to the tangential force in process of micro-convex and micro-slip, the energy storage of the micro-convex body is replaced by the equivalent, and the energy storage of the composite surface of the rectifier is obtained. On the basis of the unique conversion of energy loss and storage, a model is established. The model avoids the invariance of experimental test and enhances the visualization of theoretical derivation, and can more intuitively understand the properties of damping dissipation factor. The influence law of related parameters is obtained by numerical simulation. We can see that damping loss factor of tangential decreases first and then increases when D increase and the roughness arguments are constant. When D is about 1.25, the D reaches the least value. If the D is less than 1.5, the roughness parameter and directly proportional damping dissipation factor relations, when the fractal dimension is 1.5 exactly, the roughness parameters do not produce effect, when the D is larger than 1.5, the increase of roughness, dissipation factor decreases at the same time. Comparing with the laboratory data, the results obtained by numerical simulation are in accordance with the actual situation is found. Therefore, the model is effective in certain conditions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Digital storage; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Environmental management; Fractal dimension; Numerical models; Damping loss factor; Dissipation factors; Experimental test; Hertz contact theory; Proportional damping; Roughness parameters; Tangential contact; Theoretical derivations; Damping,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17551307,,,,English,IOP Conf.

However, given the limited research pertaining to SCG use, little is currently known about the manner in which adolescents engage with this new gambling medium. The present study aims to identify the factors that characterize adolescent social casino gamers, and to determine whether these factors differ by SCG type. Moreover, the study examines the extent to which social casino gaming is associated with monetary gambling and problem gambling in this cohort. Method: Data were obtained from students in Grades 9 to 12 (n = 10,035) residing in the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Participants completed the Youth Gambling Survey (YGS), which is a supplementary instrument administered alongside the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CSTADS). Logistic regression was used to assess the factors associated with SCG play. Results: Overall, 12.4% of respondents reported having participated in SCGs in the past three months. Compared to adolescents who did not report playing SCGs, SCG players were typically more likely to participate in monetary gambling activities, and were more prevalently classified as problem gamblers of low-to-moderate severity or high severity. Although profiles of SCG players differed across SCG game types, factors significantly associated with the playing of SCGs were gender, weekly spending money, having friends and parents who gamble, and screen time. It was also shown that current smokers were significantly more likely to participate in simulated slots online relative to adolescents who did not play SCGs. Conclusion: Significant associations exist between SCG play, monetary gambling, and problem gambling among adolescents. Gambling intervention efforts directed at this population should aim to identify personal and environmental factors associated with social casino gaming, and should be tailored to different types of SCGs. © 2018 The Author(s).",Adolescent; Facebook; Poker; Simulated gambling; Slots; Social casino games,"adolescent; Canada; epidemiology; family; female; friend; gambling; human; male; psychology; questionnaire; recreational game; risk factor; sex ratio; social behavior; social media; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; student; utilization; young adult; Adolescent; Canada; Family; Female; Friends; Gambling; Games, Recreational; Humans; Male; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Social Behavior; Social Media; Socioeconomic Factors; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712458,,,30305091,English,BMC Public Health,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054773652,

However, generally, initial implementations with practical imperfections might open loopholes, allowing an eavesdropper to compromise the security of a quantum cryptographic system. This has been shown to happen for quantum key distribution (QKD). Here we apply experience from implementation security of QKD to several other quantum cryptographic primitives. We survey quantum digital signatures, quantum secret sharing, source-independent quantum random number generation, quantum secure direct communication, and blind quantum computing. We propose how the eavesdropper could in principle exploit the loopholes to violate assumptions in these protocols, breaking their security properties. Applicable countermeasures are also discussed. It is important to consider potential implementation security issues early in protocol design, to shorten the path to future applications. © 2018 The Author(s).

We describe techniques to prepare and characterize neutron spin-orbit states, and provide a quantitative comparison to known procedures. The proposed detection method directly measures the correlations of spin state and transverse momentum, and overcomes the major challenges associated with neutrons, which are low flux and small spatial coherence length. Our preparation techniques, utilizing special geometries of magnetic fields, are based on coherent averaging and spatial control methods borrowed from nuclear magnetic resonance.

Critically, widespread misconceptions about laboratory-reported microbial non-detects have led to their erroneous description and handling as ""censored"" values. This ultimately compromises their interpretation and undermines efforts to describe and model microbial concentrations accurately. Herein, these misconceptions are dispelled by (1) discussing the critical differences between discrete microbial observations and continuous data acquired using analytical chemistry methodologies and (2) demonstrating the bias introduced by statistical approaches tailored for chemistry data and misapplied to discrete microbial data. Notably, these approaches especially preclude the accurate representation of low concentrations and those estimated using microbial methods with low or variable analytical recovery, which can be expected to result in non-detects. Techniques that account for the probabilistic relationship between observed data and underlying microbial concentrations have been widely demonstrated, and their necessity for handling non-detects (in a way which is consistent with the handling of positive observations) is underscored herein. Habitual reporting of raw microbial observations and sample sizes is proposed to facilitate accurate estimation and analysis of microbial concentrations. © 2018 Chik, Schmidt and Emelko.",Censored data; Detection limit; Microbial risk assessment; Pathogens; Presence-absence; QMRA; Zeros,article; chemistry; infectious agent; learning; limit of detection; nonhuman; public health; risk assessment; sample size,,Frontiers Media S.A.,1664302X,,,,English,Front.

We examined the relationship between staffing characteristics and residents' quality of care indicators at the unit level in LTC homes. Methods: This cross-sectional study collected data from administrative records and resident assessments from July 2014 to June 2015 at 11 LTC homes in Ontario, Canada comprising of 55 units and 32 residents in each unit. The sample included 69 registered nurses, 183 licensed/registered practical nurses, 858 nursing assistants, and 2173 residents. Practice sensitive, risk-adjusted quality indicators were described individually, then combined to create a quality of care composite ranking per unit. A multilevel regression model was used to estimate the association between staffing characteristics and quality of care composite ranking scores. Results: Nursing assistants provided the majority of direct care hours in LTC homes (76.5%). The delivery of nursing assistant care hours per resident per day was significantly associated with higher quality of resident care (p = < 0.01). There were small but significant associations with quality of care for nursing assistants with seven or more years of experience (p = 0.02), nursing assistants late to shift (p = < 0.01) and licensed/registered practical nurses late to shift (p = 0.02). Conclusions: The number of care hours per resident per day delivered by NAs is an important contributor to residents' quality of care in LTC homes. These findings can inform hiring and retention strategies for NAs in LTC, as well as examine opportunities to optimize the NA role in these settings. © 2018 The Author(s).",Health care aides; Long-term care; Nursing assistants; Nursing homes; Quality of care,aged; aggression; clinical trial; cognitive defect; cross-sectional study; daily life activity; dementia; disabled person; female; health care quality; home for the aged; human; long term care; male; measurement accuracy; multicenter study; nursing home; Ontario; personnel management; standards; statistics and numerical data; urine incontinence; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aggression; Cognition Disorders; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Accuracy; Dementia; Disabled Persons; Female; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Long-Term Care; Male; Nursing Assistants; Nursing Homes; Ontario; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Quality of Health Care; Urinary Incontinence; Workforce,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14726963,,,30285716,English,BMC Health Serv.

The purpose of this study was to propose a source pollution control measure based on the spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of the runoff pollutants at urban pavement sites. Therefore, samples from pavement runoff were collected and tested for analyzing the spatial-temporal distribution characteristics. Then, infiltration tests were conducted on selected purification materials to evaluate their purification ability to the simulated pavement runoff. Results indicated that heavy metals Zn and Pb were at high concentrations near the intersection, the reason being the frequent braking of vehicles at this site. The level of suspended solids was far higher than the limitation in the standard near the site where massive human activities occurred. Besides, the cumulative amounts of all kinds of pollutants tended to be stable with the extension of rainfall duration. The logarithmic function was found to fit the experimental data well. Finally, the pavement runoff was categorized into different situations. The combinations of purification materials were recommended and integrated into a source control measure for the treatments of different pollution situations, which made the most use of each purification material and ensured the high elimination efficiency of different pollutants. © 2018 by the authors.",Pavement engineering; Purification materials; Runoff pollutants; Source control measures; Spatial-temporal distribution,,,MDPI AG,20763417,,,,English,Appl.

Physical literacy is an evolving construct representing foundational domains upon which physically active lifestyles are based. Many sectors and organizations in Canada are embracing physical literacy in their programs, practices, policies, and research; however, the use of inconsistent definitions and conceptualizations of physical literacy had been identified by stakeholders as hindering promotion and advancement efforts. Methods: With leadership from ParticipACTION, organizations from the physical activity, public health, sport, physical education, and recreation sectors collaborated to create a physical literacy consensus definition and position statement for use by all Canadian organizations and individuals. The process involved an environmental scan, survey of related evidence, stakeholder consultations, and creation of a Steering Committee. From this background work a consensus statement was drafted, shared with stakeholders, revised, and ratified. Results: Canada's Physical Literacy Consensus Statement was launched in June 2015 at the International Physical Literacy Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. To further promote the Consensus Statement, the Sport for Life Society developed and simultaneously released the ""Vancouver Declaration"", which contained additional guidance on physical literacy. Both the Consensus Statement and the Declaration endorsed the International Physical Literacy Association's definition of physical literacy, namely ""the motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and understanding to value and take responsibility for engagement in physical activities for life"". Conclusions: Sector partners hope that the Consensus Statement, with its standardized definition, brings greater harmony, synergy, and consistency to physical literacy efforts in Canada and internationally. Going forward, the impact of this initiative on the sector, and the more distal goal of increasing habitual physical activity levels, should be assessed. © 2018 The Author(s).",Confidence; Consensus; Definition; Health; Motivation; Physical activity; Physical competence; Physical literacy; Sedentary behaviour,"adolescent; Canada; child; consensus; exercise; female; health literacy; human; male; practice guideline; preschool child; Adolescent; Canada; Child; Child, Preschool; Consensus; Exercise; Female; Guidelines as Topic; Health Literacy; Humans; Male",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712458,,,30285701,English,BMC Public Health,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054317051,

We undertake an intersectional analysis that examines dynamics between groups of fisherwomen in relation to social-ecological change. We focus specifically on (1) fisherwomens perspectives about the key drivers of change (e.g., natural disasters and aquaculture) within the social and ecological system of Chilika lagoon; (2) how environmental change is impacting the livelihoods and coping responses of fisherwomen; and (3) how fisherwomen communities are adapting to the ongoing process of change, highlighting in particular the gendered dimensions of out-migration. Our findings demonstrate that fisherwomens roles and identities are not static and that the impacts of environmental change vary for different groups of fisherwomen. We find that gender intersects with caste, income, geographic location, age, and household membership to create heterogeneous experiences and knowledge that reflects the complexities associated with gender and environmental change. With specific regard to the increase in fisherwomen out-migrating, we show that responses and adaptations to environmental change have gender-differentiated impacts and challenges. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Chilika lagoon; Environmental change; Out-migration; Small-scale fisheries; Women,,,Springer Verlag,18727859,,,,English,Marit.

The composites thermal stability, crystallization behaviour, tensile strength, and electrical property are carefully examined. The thermal stability is significantly enhanced with the incorporation of small-sized GnPs as shown by the 11.2% improvement in T5% (the temperature at which 5 wt% of the mass loss occurs) and 5.1% improvement in Tmax (the temperature at which the maximum loss rate occurs). The thermal stabilizing effect of fillers can be significantly enhanced when they are well distributed with less aggregation as is the case for small-sized GnPs. The GnPs show a considerable nucleating effect on PP by increasing the crystallization temperature (Tc). The greatest improvement in tensile property is achieved with the use of small-sized GnPs. A 33.0% enhancement in tensile strength and 59.1% improvement of tensile modulus are obtained with the use of C300 and M5, respectively. The significantly increased thermal stability and mechanical property with small-sized GnPs are due to the fact that these small-sized fillers achieve a high degree of dispersion with less agglomeration as shown in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. However, the fillers with a large sheet size are still beneficial for purposes concerning electrical conductivity since the lowest percolation is obtained with H100. The greater the size of the GnPs, the smaller the percolation threshold of composites is exhibited. © BME-PT.",Electrical conductivity; Graphene nano-platelets; Polymer composites; Polypropylene; Tensile property,Electric conductivity; Extrusion; Fillers; Graphene; Injection molding; Platelets; Polypropylenes; Scanning electron microscopy; Solvents; Technetium compounds; Tensile properties; Thermodynamic stability; Crystallization behaviours; Crystallization temperature; Electrical conductivity; Nano-platelets; Percolation thresholds; Polymer composite; The scanning electron microscopes (SEM); Thermal stabilizing effects; Tensile strength,,BME-PT and GTE,1788618X,,,,English,Express Polym.

Although academic information retrieval researchers have a long history of building and sharing systems, they are primarily designed to facilitate the publication of research papers. As such, these systems are often incomplete, inflexible, poorly documented, difcult to use, and slow, particularly in the context of modern web-scale collections. Furthermore, the growing complexity of modern software ecosystems and the resource constraints most academic research groups operate under make maintaining open-source systems a constant struggle. However, except for a small number of companies (mostly commercial web search engines) that deploy custom infrastructure, Lucene has become the de facto platform in industry for building search applications. Lucene has an active developer base, a large audience of users, and diverse capabilities to work with heterogeneous collections at scale. However, it lacks systematic support for ad hoc experimentation using standard test collections. We describe Anserini, an information retrieval toolkit built on Lucene that flls this gap. Our goal is to simplify ad hoc experimentation and allow researchers to easily reproduce results with modern bag-of-words ranking models on diverse test collections. With Anserini, we demonstrate that Lucene provides a suitable framework for supporting information retrieval research. Experiments show that our system efciently indexes large web collections, provides modern ranking models that are on par with research implementations in terms of effectiveness, and supports low-latency query evaluation to facilitate rapid experimentation. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Ad hoc retrieval; TREC,Information retrieval; Open source software; Open systems; Ad Hoc retrieval; Heterogeneous collections; Information retrieval research; Open source system; Resource Constraint; Search application; Software ecosystems; TREC; Search engines,,Association for Computing Machinery,19361955,,,,English,J.

Numerical solutions were obtained, as well as asymptotic approximations based on the assumption of perturbations of long wavelength and small variation in the consistency of the fluid with respect to temperature. We investigate the critical conditions for the onset of instability and determine the effect of a non-Newtonian rheology and the dependence of the fluid properties on temperature.

In particular, this method reconstructs the spin network basis and yields a novel dual spin network basis. While the spin network basis allows to interpret states in terms of electric excitations, on top of a vacuum sharply peaked on a vanishing electric field, the dual spin network basis describes magnetic (or curvature) excitations, on top of a vacuum sharply peaked on a vanishing magnetic field (or flat connection). This technique is also applicable for manifolds with boundaries. We distinguish in particular a dual pair of boundary conditions, namely of electric type and of magnetic type. This can be used to consider a generalization of Ocneanus tube algebra in order to reveal the algebraic structure of the excitations associated with certain 3d manifolds. © 2018, The Author(s).",Gauge Symmetry; Lattice Quantum Field Theory; Topological States of Matter,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

Aquaria and aquaculture systems therefore use biological filters that promote the growth of nitrifiers to convert ammonia to nitrate. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) have been isolated from aquarium biofilters and are available as commercial supplements, but recent evidence suggests that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are abundant in aquarium biofilters. In this study, we report the cultivation and closed genome sequence of the novel AOA representative ""Candidatus Nitrosotenuis aquarius,"" which was enriched from a freshwater aquarium biofilter. ""Ca. Nitrosotenuis aquarius"" oxidizes ammonia stoichiometrically to nitrite with a concomitant increase in thaumarchaeotal cells and a generation time of 34.9 h. ""Ca. Nitrosotenuis aquarius"" has an optimal growth temperature of 33°C, tolerates up to 3 mM NH 4 Cl, and grows optimally at 0.05% salinity. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that ""Ca. Nitrosotenuis aquarius"" cells are rod shaped, with a diameter of ~0.4 ?m and length ranging from 0.6 to 3.6 ?m. In addition, these cells possess surface layers (S-layers) and multiple proteinaceous appendages. Phylogenetically, ""Ca. Nitrosotenuis aquarius"" belongs to the group I.1a Thaumarchaeota, clustering with environmental sequences from freshwater aquarium biofilters, aquaculture systems, and wastewater treatment plants. The complete 1.70- Mbp genome contains genes involved in ammonia oxidation, bicarbonate assimilation, flagellum synthesis, chemotaxis, S-layer production, defense, and protein glycosylation.

The gradient changes of multiple projections in local windows of gray-level images are encoded to build a histogram that captures spatial projection patterns. Using projections is a conventional technique in both medical imaging and computer vision. Furthermore, powerful dense-sampling methods, such as local binary patterns and the histogram of oriented gradients, are widely used for image classification and recognition. Inspired by many achievements of such existing descriptors, we explore the design of a new class of histogram-based descriptors with particular applications in medical imaging. We experiment with three public datasets (IRMA, Kimia Path24, and CT Emphysema) to comparatively evaluate the performance of ELP histograms. In light of the tremendous success of deep architectures, we also compare the results with deep features generated by pretrained networks. The results are quite encouraging as the ELP descriptor can surpass both conventional and deep descriptors in performance in several experimental settings. © 1964-2012 IEEE.",Deep features; histopathology images; image classification; image retrieval; LBP; medical image retrieval; projections; radon transform,Computerized tomography; Feature extraction; Graphic methods; Mathematical transformations; Radon; Robustness (control systems); Biomedical imaging; Classification and recognition; Conventional techniques; Experimental settings; Histogram of oriented gradients; Histograms; Local binary patterns; Shape; Medical imaging; Article; calculation; classification algorithm; computer assisted tomography; data base; diagnostic imaging; encoded local projection; feature extraction; histogram; image analysis; image retrieval; information processing; intermethod comparison; mathematical analysis; measurement accuracy; measurement error; pattern recognition; support vector machine; task performance; thorax radiography; validation process,,IEEE Computer Society,189294,,IEBEA,29993412,English,IEEE Trans.

But its efficiency is plagued by fouling, which ultimately deteriorates the membrane's performance. This paper provides a research update on the biologically inspired liquid-enabled gating mechanism that acts as a novel filtration and separation approach offering reduction in transmembrane pressure (TMP), improved throughput, and reduced fouling. We study the performance of such Liquid Gated Membranes (LGMs) and present their benefits for filtration in the presence of model inorganic (nanoclay particles) fouling. We show over twofold higher throughput, nearly threefold longer time to foul, more than 60% reduction in irreversible fouling, ability to return to baseline pressures after backwashing along with reduction in use of backwash water, and 10%-15% reduction in TMP for filtration of nanoclay particles. Fouling models exhibit not only delayed onset of fouling for LGMs compared to the control but also different fouling characteristics.

Investigating the thermal behavior of lithium-ion pouch cells and optimizing the cooling performance are required to accomplish better performance, long life, and enhanced safety. In the present study, the cooling performance characteristics of 20 Ah lithium-ion pouch cell with cold plates along both surfaces are investigated by varying the inlet coolant mass flow rates and the inlet coolant temperatures. The inlet coolant mass flow rate is varied from 0.000833 kg/s to 0.003333 kg/s, and the inlet coolant temperature is varied from 5°C to 35°C. In addition, the effects of the cold plate geometry parameter on cooling performance of 20 Ah lithium-ion pouch cell are studied by varying the number of the channels from 4 to 10. The maximum temperature and difference between the maximum and the minimum temperatures are considered as important criteria for cooling performance evaluation of the 20 Ah lithium-ion pouch cell with cold plates along both surfaces. The cooling energy efficiency parameter (?) and the pressure drop for 20 Ah lithium-ion pouch cell with cold plates along both surfaces are also reported.

However, existing methods to assess skeletal muscle from CT are time-consuming, expensive, and require training. Clinic-friendly tools to screen for low skeletal muscle in cancer patients are urgently needed. Methods: We included 807 scans from non-metastatic colorectal cancer patients. With the digital ruler available in most radiological software, we implemented an abbreviated method to assess skeletal muscle area at the third lumbar vertebra (L3), which consisted of assessing the height and width of the psoas and paraspinal muscles and computing their combined linear area in centimetres squared (cm2). A subset of CT scans was assessed twice by two analysts to compute intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. We derived cut-points for low linear area using optimal stratification and then calculated the sensitivity and specificity of these cut-points relative to standard methods (total L3 cross-sectional area assessed with Slice-O-Matic research software). We further evaluated the association of low linear area with death from any cause after colorectal cancer diagnosis in Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for demographics, smoking, body mass index category, and tumour characteristics. Results: The linear area was highly correlated with total cross-sectional area assessed using standard methods [r = 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91, 0.93] overall and within subgroups defined by age, sex, and body mass index group. Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were equally high (both intra-class correlations = 0.98). Cut-points for low linear area were sensitive (0.75; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.80) and specific (0.77; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.80) for identifying low skeletal muscle relative to the standard of total L3 cross-sectional area. The hazard ratio and 95% CI for death associated with a low linear area were hazard ratio = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.25. Conclusions: Clinic-friendly methods that assess linear area from CT scans are an accurate screening tool to identify low skeletal muscle among non-metastatic colorectal cancer patients. These linear measures are associated with mortality after colorectal cancer, suggesting they could be clinically useful both to improve prognostication and to provide a practical screening tool to identify cancer patients who require nutrition or exercise intervention. © 2018 The Authors.

In primary care, clinician behaviors and attitudes are important precursors to structured data entry, and there is an impact on overall data quality. We hypothesized that persuasive design changes data-entry behaviors in clinicians and thus improves data quality. Objective: The objective of this study was to use persuasive design principles to change clinician data-entry behaviors in a primary care environment and to increase data quality of data held in a family health teams reporting system. Methods: We used the persuasive systems design framework to describe the persuasion context. Afterward, we designed and implemented new features into a summary screen that leveraged several persuasive design principles. We tested the influence of the new features by measuring its impact on 3 data quality measures (same-day entry, record completeness, and data validity). We also measured the impacts of the new features with a paired pre-post t test and generated XmR charts to contextualize the results. Survey responses were also collected from users. Results: A total of 53 users used the updated system that incorporated the new features over the course of 8 weeks. Based on a pre-post analysis, the new summary screen successfully encouraged users to enter more of their data on the same day as their encounter. On average, the percentage of same-day entries rose by 10.3% for each user (P<.001). During the first month of the postimplementation period, users compensated by sacrificing aspects of data completeness before returning to normal in the second month. Improvements to record validity were marginal over the study period (P=.05). Statistical process control techniques allowed us to study the XmR charts to contextualize our results and understand trends throughout the study period. Conclusions: By conducting a detailed systems analysis and introducing new persuasive design elements into a data-entry system, we demonstrated that it was possible to change data-entry behavior and influence data quality in a reporting system. The results show that using persuasive design concepts May be effective in influencing data-entry behaviors in clinicians. There May be opportunities to continue improving this approach, and further work is required to perfect and test additional designs. Persuasive design is a viable approach to encourage clinician user change and could support better data capture in the field of medical informatics. © Justin St-Maurice, Catherine Burns, Justin Wolting.",Data accuracy; Data collection; Data entry; Health care; Persuasive design; Persuasive systems design framework; User interface,,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,14388871,,,,English,J.

In D = 4, we consider Einsteinian cubic gravity, for which we construct solutions with ? = S2, T2. These represent the first generalizations of the Einstein gravity Taub-NUT/bolt solutions for any higher-curvature theory in four dimensions. In D = 6, we show that no new solutions are allowed for any Generalized quasi-topological gravity at cubic order. They exist however when we consider quartic Quasi-topological and Generalized quasi-topological terms, for which we construct new solutions with ?=??2,S2×S2,S2×T2,T2×T2. In all cases, the solutions are characterized by a single metric function, and they reduce to the corresponding ones in Einstein gravity when the higher-curvature couplings are set to zero. While the explicit profiles must be constructed numerically (except for a few cases), we obtain fully analytic expressions for the thermodynamic properties of all solutions. The new solutions present important differences with respect to Einstein gravity, including regular bolts for arbitrary values of the NUT charge, critical points, and re-entrant phase transitions. © 2018, The Author(s).",AdS-CFT Correspondence; Black Holes; Classical Theories of Gravity,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

Design Population-based cohort study. Setting Patients attending primary care practices registered with the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Participants Using the UK-based CPRD, we identified two incretin-based therapies cohorts: (1) dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i)-cohort, consisting of new users of DPP-4i and SU and (2) glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA)-cohort, consisting of new users of GLP-1RA and SU, between January 2007 and January 2016. Patients with a prior history of depression, self-harm and other serious psychiatric conditions were excluded. Main outcome measures The primary study outcome comprised a composite of new-onset depression or self-harm. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to quantify the association between incretin-based therapies and depression or self-harm. Deciles of High-Dimensional Propensity Scores and concurrent number of glucose-lowering agents were used to adjust for potential confounding. Results We identified new users of 6206 DPP-4i and 22 128 SU in the DPP-4i-cohort, and 501 GLP-1RA and 16 409 SU new users in the GLP-1RA-cohort. The incidence of depression or self-harm was 8.2 vs 11.7 events/1000 person-years in the DPP-4i-cohort and 18.2 vs 13.6 events/1000 person-years in the GLP-1RA-cohort for incretin-based therapies versus SU, respectively. Incretin-based therapies were not associated with an increased or decreased incidence of depression or self-harm compared with SU (DPP-4i-cohort: Unadjusted HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96; adjusted HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.13; GLP-1RA-cohort: Unadjusted HR 1.36, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.58; adjusted HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.50). Consistent results were observed for other glucose-lowering comparators including insulin and thiazolidinediones. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the two incretin-based therapies are not associated with an increased or decreased risk of depression or self-harm. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

Using simplicial arguments, we emphasize how the consistency condition of the unitary map performing a local change of triangulation is equivalent to the coherence relation of the pentagonator 2-morphism of a monoidal 2-category. By weakening some axioms of such 2-category, we obtain a cohomological model whose underlying 1-category is a 2-group. Topological models from 2-groups together with their lattice realization are then studied from a higher gauge theory point of view. Symmetry protected topological phases protected by higher symmetry structures are explicitly constructed, and the gauging procedure which yields the corresponding topological gauge theories is discussed in detail. We finally study the correspondence between symmetry protected topological phases and t Hooft anomalies in the context of these higher group symmetries. © 2018, The Author(s).",Gauge Symmetry; Topological Field Theories; Topological States of Matter,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

The complexity of the coherent states have the same UV divergences as the vacuum state complexity and so we consider the finite increase of the complexity of these states over the vacuum state. One observation is that generally, the optimal circuits introduce entanglement between the normal modes at intermediate stages even though our reference state and target states are not entangled in this basis. We also compare our results from Nielsens approach with those found using the Fubini-Study method of [2]. For general coherent states, we find that the complexities, as well as the optimal circuits, derived from these two approaches, are different. © 2018, The Author(s).",AdS-CFT Correspondence; Black Holes in String Theory; Effective Field Theories; Lattice Quantum Field Theory,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

We apply this method to various effective field theories with and without color degrees of freedom. In the colored case, we study the U(N) non-linear sigma model of Goldstone bosons (NLSM) in a recent parametrization due to Cheung and Shen, as well as its extension involving a coupling to the bi-adjoint scalar. We propose a Lagrangian and a Cachazo-He-Yuan formula for the latter valid in multi-trace sectors and systematically calculate its amplitudes. Furthermore, we make a similar proposal for a higher-derivative correction to NLSM that agrees with the subleading order of the abelian Z-theory. In the colorless cases, we formulate perturbiner expansions for the special Galileon and Born-Infeld theories.

Generally, scholars propose addressing this problem by increasing agricultural production, investing in technology to boost yields, changing diets, or reducing food waste. In this paper, we explore whether global food production is nutritionally balanced by comparing the diet that nutritionists recommend versus global agricultural production statistics. Results show that the global agricultural system currently overproduces grains, fats, and sugars while production of fruits and vegetables and protein is not sufficient to meet the nutritional needs of the current population. Correcting this imbalance could reduce the amount of arable land used by agriculture by 51 million ha globally but would increase total land used for agriculture by 407 million ha and increase greenhouse gas emissions. For a growing population, our calculations suggest that the only way to eat a nutritionally balanced diet, save land and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to consume and produce more fruits and vegetables as well as transition to diets higher in plant-based protein. Such a move will help protect habitats and help meet the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2018 KC et al.

Part 2 provides a detailed analysis of on-road and off-road information inventory methods, including the detection and extraction of on-road objects (e.g., road surface, road markings, driving lines, and road crack) and off-road objects (e.g., pole-like objects and power lines). Part 3 presents a refined integrated analysis of challenges and future trends. Our review shows that MLS technology is well proven in urban object detection and extraction, since the improvement of hardware and software accelerate the efficiency and accuracy of data collection and processing. When compared to other review papers focusing on MLS applications, we review the state-of-the-art road object detection and extraction methods using MLS data and discuss their performance and applicability. The main contribution of this review demonstrates that the MLS systems are suitable for supporting road asset inventory, ITS-related applications, high-definition maps, and other highly accurate localization services. © 2018 by the authors.",Deep learning; Driving line; Mobile laser scanning (MLS); Point cloud; Power line; Road crack; Road marking; Road surface; Street light; Traffic sign; Tree,Data handling; Deep learning; Extraction; Highway markings; Laser applications; Object detection; Object recognition; Roads and streets; Street lighting; Traffic signs; Driving line; Laser scanning; Point cloud; Power lines; Road cracks; Road marking; Road surfaces; Tree; Road and street markings,,MDPI AG,20724292,,,,English,Remote Sens.,Review,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055455873,

This entity often presents with scrotal mass, inguinal hernia, or cryptorchidism. Herein, we report our experience with a boy who presented with a scrotal enlargement which later turned out to be SGF. Moreover, an accessory spleen was unexpectedly found in the left inguinal canal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of SGF and accessory spleen in the literature. Although rare, SGF should be included in the complete differential diagnosis list of scrotal masses, especially in children. The use of frozen section pathology if available would aid the surgeon in avoiding unnecessary orchiectomy in small testicular masses of benign origin. © 2018 Medknow Publications.

Pediatric clinical pharmacologists may be physicians but are more likely to be pharmacists or PhD scientists, and pediatric clinical pharmacology today is largely a research specialty rather than a subspecialty for direct patient care. Pharmacometrics, including top-down population modeling and bottom-up physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling, has become an indispensable tool for pharmaceutical industry scientists, government regulators, academic researchers, and even a handful of patient-oriented practitioners. This review summarizes the application of pharmacometrics within each of these domains and predicts future trends of further applications across the spectrum of pediatric clinical pharmacology from drug development to patient care. © 2018, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology",clinical pharmacology; modeling; pediatric; pharmacometrics; simulation; therapeutic drug monitoring,algorithm; allometry; Article; clinical pharmacology; drug industry; food and drug administration; human; minimum inhibitory concentration; molecular dynamics; mycosis; patient care; pharmacist; pharmacodynamic parameters; pharmacokinetic parameters; pharmacologist,,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,912700,,JCPCB,,English,J.

It is conventionally considered to be characterized by a closure temperature range between 375 and 600 °C and hence has been employed to address mid-temperature thermochronology questions relevant to the reconstruction of thermal events in the middle to lower crust. However, questions remain as to whether apatite faithfully records thermally-activated volume diffusion profiles, or rather is influenced by recrystallization and new growth processes. We present a case study of two apatite samples from the Akia Terrane in Greenland that help chart some of the post magmatic history of this region. Apatite in a tonalitic gneiss has distinct U-enriched rims and its U-Pb apparent ages correlate with Mn chemistry, with a high Mn group yielding an age of c. 2813 Ma. The U-Pb and trace element chemistry and morphology support an interpretation in which these apatite crystals are originally igneous and record cooling after metamorphism, with subsequent generation of discrete new rims. Epidote observed in the sample implies a <600 °C fluid infiltration event associated with apatite rims. The second sample, from a granitic leucosome, contains apparently homogeneous apatite, however U-Pb analyses define two distinct discordia arrays with different common Pb components. An older, c. 2490 Ma, component is associated with elevated Sr, whereas a younger, c. 1800 Ma, component has lower Sr concentration. A depth profile reveals an older core with progressively younger ages towards a compositionally discrete late Paleoproterozoic rim. The chemical and age profiles do not directly correspond, implying different diffusion rates between trace elements and U and Pb. The variation in core ages is interpreted to reflect radiogenic-Pb loss from a metamorphic population during new rim growth. The younger, c. 1800 Ma U-Pb age is interpreted to date new apatite growth from a compositionally distinct reservoir driven by tectonothermal and fluid activity, consistent with regional mica Ar-Ar ages. Results from these two samples show that recrystallization, dissolution and regrowth processes likely formed the younger rim overgrowths, and at temperatures below those often considered to be closure temperatures for Pb diffusion in apatite. The results from these samples imply many apatite grains may not record simple thermally activated Pb diffusion profiles and cautions against inversion of apatite U-Pb data to thermal histories without detailed knowledge of the grain growth/alteration processes. © 2018 The Authors",Apatite; Geochronology; Greenland; Metamorphism; Pseudosection; Themochronology; U-Pb,apatite; argon-argon dating; diagram; metamorphism; recrystallization; regrowth; thermochronology; trace element; uranium-lead dating; Arctic; Greenland,,Elsevier B.V.,244937,,,,English,Lithos,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051636362,

Methods: HOA values were obtained from the corneal surface (CS) and whole eye (WE), using a corneal topographer and ShackHartmann aberrometer, from both eyes of 50 subjects (25 females, mean age ± sd 32.5 ± 11.0 years, and 25 males, 33.88 ± 11.2 years) for two pupil sizes (3 and 6 mm) in a dark environment. One drop of Blink Contacts (Abbott Medical Optics) was instilled into the right eye and HOA measurements repeated after 30 s. After 1 h, the meibomian glands of the left lower eyelid were gently squeezed and HOA measurements repeated after 30 s. Results: There was no significant difference for CS and WE root mean square (RMS) HOAs between right and left eyes before (both pupil sizes) and after TE use or ME (3 mm pupil). For 6 mm pupil, TE use significantly reduced the WE RMS HOA (p &lt; 0.05, mean ± sd) for Z4 0 (0.297 ± 0.136 to 0.053 ± 0.069), and Z5 5 (0.221 ± 0.372 to 0.098 ± 0.121) while ME significantly increased CS RMS HOA (p &lt; 0.05, mean ± sd) for Z3 ?3 (0.799 ± 1.178 to 1.302 ± 1.991) and Z4 4 (0.594 ± 1.184 to 0.988 ± 1.463). In general, the change in HOA was significantly correlated with the initial value before TE use or ME (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: There were no detectable differences between right and left eyes. For the 6 mm pupil, the tear enhancer tended to improve optical performance of the WE and meibomian gland expression tended to reduce the optical performance at the CS. © 2018 Spanish General Council of Optometry",High order aberrations; Meibomian gland expression; Tears; Tears enhancer,hyaluronic acid; viscosupplement; adult; cornea; corneal wavefront aberration; drug effect; female; human; keratometry; male; meibomian gland; metabolism; middle aged; young adult; Adult; Cornea; Corneal Topography; Corneal Wavefront Aberration; Female; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Male; Meibomian Glands; Middle Aged; Viscosupplements; Young Adult,,Spanish Council of Optometry,18884296,,,29699948,English; Spanish,J.

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of an evidence-informed smartphone app for smoking cessation, Crush the Crave (CTC), on reducing smoking prevalence among young adult smokers in comparison with an evidence-informed self-help guide, On the Road to Quitting (OnRQ). Methods: A parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with 2 arms was conducted in Canada to evaluate CTC. In total, 1599 young adult smokers (aged 19 to 29 years) intending to quit smoking in the next 30 days were recruited online and randomized to receive CTC or the control condition OnRQ for a period of 6 months. The primary outcome measure was self-reported continuous abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. Results: Overall follow-up rates were 57.41% (918/1599) and 60.48% (967/1599) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Moreover, 45.34% (725/1599) of participants completed baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis (last observation carried forward) showed that continuous abstinence (N=1599) at 6 months was not significantly different at 7.8% (64/820) for CTC versus 9.2% (72/779) for OnRQ (odds ratio; OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59-1.18). Similarly, 30-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months was not significantly different at 14.4% (118/820) and 16.9% (132/779) for CTC and OnRQ, respectively (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.63-1.08). However, these rates of abstinence were favorable compared with unassisted 30-day quit rates of 11.5% among young adults. Secondary measures of quit attempts and the number of cigarettes smoked per day at 6-month follow-up did not reveal any significant differences between groups. For those who completed the 6-month follow-up, 85.1% (359/422) of young adult smokers downloaded CTC as compared with 81.8% (346/423) of OnRQ, ? 2 1(N=845) =1.6, P=.23. Furthermore, OnRQ participants reported significantly higher levels of overall satisfaction (mean 3.3 [SD 1.1] vs mean 2.6 [SD 1.3]; t 644 =6.87, P&lt;.001), perceived helpfulness (mean 5.8 [SD 2.4] vs mean 4.3 [SD 2.6], t 657 =8.0, P&lt;.001), and frequency of use (mean 3.6 [SD 1.2] vs mean 3.2 [SD 1.1], t 683 =5.7, P&lt;.001) compared with CTC participants. Conclusions: CTC was feasible for delivering cessation support but was not superior to a self-help guide in helping motivated young adults to quit smoking. CTC will benefit from further formative research to address satisfaction and usage. As smartphone apps may not serve as useful alternatives to printed self-help guides, there is a need to conduct further research to understand how digital mobile technology smoking cessation interventions for smoking cessation can be improved. © Neill Bruce Baskerville, Laura Louise Struik, Godefroy Emmanuel Guindon, Cameron D Norman, Robyn Whittaker, Catherine Burns, David Hammond, Darly Dash, K Stephen Brown.",Health behavior; mHealth; Mobile phone; Randomized controlled trial; Smoking cessation; Young adult,,,JMIR Publications,22915222,,,,English,JMIR mHealth uHealth,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060335969,

Egypt has used pictorial health warnings (PHWs) on waterpipe tobacco packs (WTPs) and has rotated these every two years since 2008. We explored in this qualitative study how participants perceived existing PHWs on WTPs, assessed how they interpreted novel plain packaging of WT featuring enhanced PHWs, and probed perceptions of how existing and novel sets would affect uptake or cessation of WTS. Design We conducted ten qualitative focus groups and ten in-depth interviews. We explored participants' views of the four existing PHWs (occupied 50% of the front and back of WTPs, displayed cancers, and featured colourful fruits and flavors) and four novel PHWs (occupied 80% of the front and back of WTPs, displayed different topical content, with plain packaging). Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Setting Rural Menoufia, urban and semi-urban Cairo, Egypt. Participants 90 waterpipe smokers and non-smokers, men and women, aged 18 years or older. Outcomes Perceived potential effect on WTS uptake or cessation, probing factors related to PHW content and WTP design. Results Participants in focus groups and in-depth interviews thought existing WT PHWs elicited affective responses, but found them unclear or unrealistic and thought the colourful packaging detracted from the warnings. In contrast, they thought novel and larger WT PHWs presented in plain packaging might prevent WTS initiation or trigger quit attempts. Participants regarded warnings featuring proximal health risks as most likely to be acceptable. Conclusions Our exploratory study suggests larger WT PHWs featuring proximal risks and presented on plain WTPs could potentially deter experimentation with WT products among non-users and promote cessation among existing users. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

Little is published about monitoring this systemic autoimmune DED. We analyzed the SS related DED tests used in North American optometric practices and compared academic settings to private practice settings. Methods: A retrospective chart review of 123 SS charts from 6 optometric practices in North America was conducted. Testing done during the first examination following a SS diagnosis was recorded on Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. The complete data file was reviewed and testing type and methodology were compared. Results: Symptoms of DED (98.4% of charts),meibomian gland dysfunction (76.4% of charts), corneal staining with fluorescein (75.6% of charts) and anterior blepharitis (73.2% of charts) were the most frequently recorded variables. Clinicians used different methodologies to measure and grade these variables.

In this population, dose selection to achieve safe and effective drug exposure is difficult. We developed a novel and flexible approach that uses physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to translate results from ECMO ex vivo experiments into bedside dosing recommendations. To determine fluconazole dosing in children on ECMO, we developed a PBPK model, which was validated using fluconazole pharmacokinetic (PK) data in adults and critically ill infants. Next, an ECMO compartment was added to the PBPK model and parameterized using data from a previously published ex vivo study. Simulations using the final ECMO PBPK model reasonably characterized observed PK data in infants on ECMO, and the model was used to derive dosing in children on ECMO across the pediatric age spectrum. This approach can be generalized to other forms of extracorporeal life support (ECLS), such as dialysis. © 2018 The Authors CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.",,fluconazole; Article; AUC (0-24 h); candidiasis; child; clearance; clinical trial (topic); dialysis; drug degradation; drug disposition; drug dose regimen; drug exposure; drug interaction; extracorporeal oxygenation; glomerulus filtration rate; human; in vitro study; infant; lipophilicity; long term care; mathematical model; molecular weight; pharmacokinetics; physical chemistry; priority journal; risk factor; treatment failure,,American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics,21638306,,,30033691,English,CPT Pharmacometrics Syst.

The discussion of the emergent theoretical core is centered on four shared structuring elements of SE systems: components, connections, scale, and context.

Influencing factors include: technological and management changes at farm level and along the value chain resulting in greater production efficiencies and improved life cycle resource efficiency and environmental performance; a changing policy/regulatory environment; and shifts in societal expectations and associated market dynamics, including increased attention to animal welfare outcomes-especially in regard to changes in housing systems for laying hens. In the face of this change, effective decision-making is needed to ensure the sustainability of the Canadian egg industry. Attention both to lessons from the past and to the emerging challenges that will shape its future is required and multi- and interdisciplinary perspectives are needed to understand synergies and potential trade-offs between alternative courses of action across multiple aspects of sustainability. Here, we consider the past, present and potential futures for this industry through the lenses of environmental, institutional (i.e., regulatory), and socio-economic sustainability, with an emphasis on animal welfare as an important emergent social consideration.

Within the centralized approach, a system-wide optimization technique is firstly utilized to estimate the overall optimal net benefits when the water demand management initiatives are implemented. Cooperative game-theoretic methods are used to fairly redistribute the additional net benefits. In terms of the decentralized perspective, an agent-based modelling framework is adopted to permit each user to make independent decisions on whether to conserve water or consume extra water and how much to conserve or consume by solving individual optimization problems. For comparison purposes, both the centralized and decentralized approaches are applied to a case study reflecting an actual situation in the South Saskatchewan River basin in Alberta, Canada. Both methods provide positive incentives to encourage users to conserve water while maintaining at least the same level of economic benefits such that system-wide productivity is improved. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the centralized method produces greater overall net benefits, but the users may be less motivated to participate. © 2018 by the authors.",Agent-based modelling; Bargaining; Centralized and decentralized perspectives; Cooperative game; Net benefits; Optimization; Water demand management,,,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054052714,

The primary molecular-based approach for solving this problem has been the reaction ensemble Monte Carlo (REMC) algorithm [ Turner et al. Molec. Simulation 2008, 34, (2), 119-146 ], based on classical force-field methodology. In spite of the vast improvements in computer hardware and software since its original development almost 25 years ago, its more widespread application is impeded by its computational inefficiency. A fundamental problem is that its MC basis inhibits the implementation of significant parallelization, and its successful implementation often requires system-specific tailoring and the incorporation of special MC approaches such as replica exchange, expanded ensemble, umbrella sampling, configurational bias, and continuous fractional component methodologies. We describe herein a novel CRE algorithm (reaction ensemble molecular dynamics, ReMD) that exploits modern computer hardware and software capabilities, and which can be straightforwardly implemented for systems of arbitrary size and complexity by exploiting the parallel computing methodology incorporated within many MD software packages (herein, we use GROMACS for illustrative purposes). The ReMD algorithm utilizes these features in the context of a macroscopically inspired and generally applicable free energy minimization approach based on the iterative approximation of the system Gibbs free energy function by a mathematically simple convex ideal solution model using the composition at each iteration as a reference state. Finally, we additionally describe a simple and computationally efficient a posteriori method to estimate the equilibrium concentrations of species present in very small amounts relative to others in the primary calculation. To demonstrate the algorithm, we show its application to two classic example systems considered previously in the literature: the N 2 -O 2 -NO system and the ammonia synthesis system. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,Ammonia; Application programs; Approximation algorithms; Computational efficiency; Computer hardware; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Hardware; Molecular dynamics; Molecular structure; Molecular weight; Problem solving; Reaction kinetics; Ammonia synthesis system; Classical force fields; Computationally efficient; Equilibrium concentration; Free energy minimization; Hardware and software; Iterative approximations; Molecular simulations; Iterative methods,,American Chemical Society,23747943,,,,English,ACS Cent.

Rising sea levels, sinking coasts, and changing precipitation patterns modify hydrodynamic gradients and may enhance sea-land exchange processes in both tidal and non-tidal systems. Furthermore, the removal of flood protection structures as restoration measure contributes locally to the changing coastlines. A detailed understanding of the ecosystem functioning of coastal zones and the interactions between connected terrestrial and marine ecosystems is still lacking. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary approach to the investigation of interactions between land and sea at shallow coasts, and discuss the advantages and the first results provided by this approach as applied by the research training group Baltic TRANSCOAST. A low-lying fen peat site including the offshore shallow sea area on the southern Baltic Sea coast has been chosen as a model system to quantify hydrophysical, biogeochemical, sedimentological, and biological processes across the land-sea interface. Recently introduced rewetting measures might have enhanced submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) as indicated by distinct patterns of salinity gradients in the near shore sediments, making the coastal waters in front of the study site a mixing zone of fresh- and brackish water. High nutrient loadings, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) originating from the degraded peat may affect micro- and macro-phytobenthos, with the impact propagating to higher trophic levels. The terrestrial part of the study site is subject to periodic brackish water intrusion caused by occasional flooding, which has altered the hydraulic and biogeochemical properties of the prevailing peat soils. The stable salinity distribution in the main part of the peatland reveals the legacy of flooding events. Generally, elevated sulfate concentrations are assumed to influence greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, mainly by inhibiting methane production, yet our investigations indicate complex interactions between the different biogeochemical element cycles (e.g., carbon and sulfur) caused by connected hydrological pathways. In conclusion, sea-land interactions are far reaching, occurring on either side of the interface, and can only be understood when both long-term and event-based patterns and different spatial scales are taken into account in interdisciplinary research that involves marine and terrestrial expertise. © 2018 Jurasinski, Janssen, Voss, Böttcher, Brede, Burchard, Forster, Gosch, Gräwe, Gründling-Pfaff, Haider, Ibenthal, Karow, Karsten, Kreuzburg, Lange, Leinweber, Massmann, Ptak, Rezanezhad, Rehder, Romoth, Schade, Schubert, Schulz-Vogt, Sokolova, Strehse, Unger, Westphal and Lennartz.",Coastal peatland; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land-sea coupling; Shallow coast; Submarine groundwater discharge,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,22967745,,,,English,Front.

Forming limit experiments using limiting dome height (LDH) specimens were performed under plane-strain loading conditions using a 100 mm hemispherical Nakazima punch. Strains were measured using in situ stereoscopic digital image correlation (DIC). Two forming processing routes were examined: (i) an intermediate quench and form (IQF) processing route in which the LDH coupons were solutionized, quenched to a preset temperature, and isothermally formed and (ii) a die-quench (DQ) process where the LDH coupons were solutionized, and quenched and formed simultaneously with room temperature (RT) tooling under non-isothermal conditions. The DQ processing route was devised to understand the formability of the alloy under practical die-quenching conditions, while the IQF route was meant to understand the influence of temperature on the formability of the material. The DQ processing route exhibited the best formability from a localization standpoint; however, it was found that at deformations in excess of 0.5 major true strain, an orange-peel defect was present. The IQF process with room temperature tooling may be comparable to a W-temper forming operation.

Various types of specimen geometries were fabricated in different orientations with respect to the rolling direction of the sheet to reveal the anisotropic fracture response of the alloy under proportional loading conditions. To visualize directional dependency of the fracture response, experimental fracture loci for different orientations were constructed. Furthermore, non-proportional tests were performed by abrupt changes of stress states to study the role of the loading history on fracture behaviour of the alloy. The non-proportional tests entailed pre-straining the material in uniaxial and equi-biaxial tension up to a prescribed deformation level, followed by extreme changes of stress states to plane-strain tension or shear. Based on the results of the proportional and non-proportional tests, the validity of employing ""damage indicator"" approaches commonly utilized in phenomenological modelling of fracture is assessed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Damage detection; Deep drawing; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Magnesium printing plates; Rare earths; Rolling; Strain; Stress analysis; Anisotropic fractures; Fracture behaviour; Fracture characterization; Magnesium alloy sheets; Nonproportional loading; Plane strain tension; Proportional loading; Quasi-static conditions; Magnesium alloys,Butcher C.Worswick M.Bardelcik A.,Institute of Physics Publishing,17578981,,,,English,IOP Conf.

This paper evaluates three such models using austenite phase fractions derived from Vickers hardness measurements made on Al-Si coated 22MnB5 coupons heated within lab-scale muffle furnace and then water-quenched. Overall, predicted trends are in good agreement with the experimental results at different soak temperatures, but experimental trends with increasing soak times are less obvious.

The limited room temperature formability of these alloys can be overcome through elevated temperature forming while controlling heat exposure to prevent changes to the microstructure such as over-aging. The present work details a comprehensive characterization of a developmental alloy, 7xxx-T76, for non-isothermal warm forming of a cylindrical deep drawn cup. Material anisotropy and a non-associated constitutive model were developed with the hardening response as a function of temperature and strain-rate. Friction was characterized at elevated temperature using a Warm Twist Compression Test apparatus developed at the University of Waterloo. Significant material anisotropy was observed in the tensile characterization results and during warm forming with the formation of eight ears in the deep drawn cups for a drawing ratio of 2.25.

Being a relatively new technology, adopting the DQ process into automotive assembly lines involved several challenges. One of these challenges is the constitutive modelling, which is being addressed in literature. Another challenge is determining the proper formability conditions for DQ to work. To this end, the work presented herein investigated different forming parameters required to successfully deep draw AA7075 discs. Two disc sizes were selected: 177.8 and 203.3 mm. Parameters that were investigated were: binder load and lubricant applied. The deep draw experiments were also modelled in the LS-Dyna finite element code, using the constitutive data and a Barlat-2000 yield surface developed in other work by the authors. The predicted deep draw curves were found to match well the experimental data.

Due to the strain-rate sensitivity of magnesium alloys at elevated temperature, it was important to ensure that the strain-rate remained reasonably constant during the bulge test. Various gas pressure versus time profiles were used to achieve strain-rates in the range of 0.01 s-1 to 0.1 s-1. The results from equi-biaxial bulge testing will be detailed in addition to bulge testing performed using elliptical dies with various aspect ratios to generate data under different biaxial stretching conditions. Supplementary characterization was provided using shear specimen data and tension test data from the rolling and transverse directions of the sheet. The biaxial, tensile, and shear data was used to calibrate a linear transformation-based anisotropic yield function at 200 °C. The yield function coefficients were optimized by matching the surface displacement data between experiments and finite element simulations of the bulge test. Agreement of the surface displacement data for a given applied pressure ensured that both the stress and strain in the bulged dome were accurately captured.

Both isothermal and non-isothermal experiments are performed with a draw ratio of 2.25. Warm temperature formability of ZEK100 is investigated through determination of draw depths of cylindrical cups under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. The effect of sheet anisotropy during deep drawing operation is investigated by measuring the earring profiles by means of digital imaging as well as sheet thickness from the center to the outer diameter in the rolling direction.

Temperature process windows are used to present a direct comparison of forming behavior between ZEK100 and AZ31B. The increased forming performance of ZEK100 at elevated temperatures is attributed to the weakened texture resulting from alloying with Zr and Nd, respectively, allowing for elevated slip activity at lower temperatures. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Drawing (forming); Isotherms; Magnesium alloys; Magnesium printing plates; Rare earths; Slip forming; Cylindrical punches; Drawing performance; Elevated temperature; Forming performance; Lower temperatures; Magnesium-rare earths; Non-isothermal condition; Wrought magnesium alloys; Deep drawing,Butcher C.Worswick M.Bardelcik A.,Institute of Physics Publishing,17578981,,,,English,IOP Conf.

In particular, transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steel has shown promise as a candidate for lightweighting of vehicles because of their enhanced formability. However, predictive modeling of TRIP steel in formability is difficult due the combination of dislocation and transformation mechanisms occurring during deformation for various strain paths. This work presents a crystal plasticity constitutive model to simulate the behaviour of deformation induced ? ? ?' transformation. A physics based transformation model is implemented into the crystal plasticity framework to fully capture the behavior of TRIP assisted steels.

In this work, numerical simulation is used to investigate the crush response of a Usibor® 1500-AS axial crush rail with tailored properties achieved using in-die heated (IDH) hot stamping. In this case, the targeted properties in the softened zone correspond to a tensile strength of 1000 MPa. A finite element model is utilized to predict the crash performance of the tailored in-die heated 1000 MPa crush tip within a Usibor® 1500-AS rail. A numerical parametric study is presented, comparing the crush response based on fracture loci determined using two different plane-strain strain experiments, one the plane-strain Nakazima dome test and the other the VDA-238 V-bending test. In addition a number of different mesh regularization treatments are considered. The predictions exhibit a strong dependency of the onset of fracture upon the plane strain fracture strain level and degree of mesh regularization. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Deep drawing; Forging machines; Fracture; Mesh generation; Strain; Tensile strength; Axial crushes; Crash performance; Crush response; Different planes; Fracture locus; Front-end structures; Numerical parametric studies; Tailored properties; Stamping,Butcher C.Worswick M.Bardelcik A.,Institute of Physics Publishing,17578981,,,,English,IOP Conf.

To acquire highly efficient and relatively accurate mapping for large-scale GPS/GNSS-denied scene, we present an upgraded backpacked laser scanning system and a car-mounted indoor mobile laser scanning system. The systems provide both 3D laser scanning point cloud and camera images. In this paper, a simultaneous extrinsic calibration approach for multiple multi-beam LIDAR and multiple cameras is also proposed using the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)-based algorithm. The proposed approach uses the SLAM-based algorithm to achieve a large calibration scene using mobile platforms, registers an acquired multi-beam LIDAR point cloud to the terrestrial LIDAR point cloud to acquire denser points for corner feature extraction, and finally achieves simultaneous calibration. With the proposed mapping and calibration algorithms, we can provide centimetre-lever coloured point cloud with relatively high efficiency and accuracy. © Authors 2018.

Our calculation is facilitated by the fact that the null boundaries of the Wheeler-DeWitt patch do not contribute at late times and essential contributions coming from the joints are now understood. The late time growth rate reduces to a difference of internal energies associated with the inner and outer horizons, and in the limit where the mass is much larger than the charge, we reproduce the celebrated result of 2M/? with corrections proportional to the highest Lovelock coupling in even (boundary) dimensions. We find in some cases a minimum mass below which complexity remains effectively constant, even if the black hole contains a nondegenerate horizon. © 2018 authors.

The electrode-tissue contacts remain one of the major obstacles of neural prostheses microstructure. Recently, Microelectrode fabrication techniques have been developed to have a long-term and stable interface with the brain. In this paper, a comparative analysis of finite element models (FEM) for several electrode layouts is conducted. FEM involves parametric and sensitivity analysis to show the effects of the different design parameters on the electrode mechanical performance. These parameters include electrode dimensions, geometry, and materials. The electrodes mechanical performance is evaluated with various analysis techniques including: linear buckling analysis, stationary analysis with axial and shear loading, and failure analysis for brittle and ductile materials. Finally, a novel figure of merit (FOM) is presented and dedicated to the various electrodes prototypes. The proposed designs take into account mechanical performance, fabrication cost, and cross sectional area of the electrode. The FOM provides important design insights to help the electrodes designers to select the best electrode design parameters that meet their design constraints. © 2018 The Author(s).",Buckling analysis; Finite element model; FOM; Microelectrode; Stationary analysis,Microelectrodes; Neural prostheses; Prosthetics; Sensitivity analysis; Surgery; Buckling analysis; Deep brain stimulation; Design and implementations; Figure of merit (FOM); Linear buckling analysis; Mechanical performance; Microelectrode fabrication; Stationary analysis; Finite element method; alloy; copper; nickel; polyamide; silicon; biomechanics; comparative study; cost; cross-sectional area; density; device failure analysis; equipment design; finite element analysis; geometry; linear buckling analysis; measurement; novel figure of merit; parametric test; performance; physical parameters; Poison ratio; priority journal; Review; sensitivity analysis; shear strength; Young modulus; brain depth stimulation; devices; economics; electrode; mechanics; Costs and Cost Analysis; Deep Brain Stimulation; Electrodes; Equipment Design; Mechanical Phenomena; Shear Strength,,BioMed Central Ltd.,1475925X,,BEOIB,30227862,English,Biomed.

Our study develops allometric equations for three dominant genera found in boreal fens: Alnus spp. (alder), Salix spp. (willow) and Betula pumila (bog birch). Two different types of local equations were developed: (1) individual equations based on genus/phylogeny, and (2) a general equation that pooled all individuals regardless of genera. The general equation had a R2 = 0.97 (n = 82), and was not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05) than any of the phylogenetic equations. This indicated that a single generalized equation is sufficient in estimating AGB for all three genera occurring in our study area. A closer look at the performance of the general equation revealed that smaller stems were predicted less accurately than larger stems because of the higher variability of leafy biomass found in small individuals. Previously published equations developed in other ecoregions did not perform as well as our local equations. © 2018 by the authors.",Allometric equations; Allometry; Biomass; Biometry; Carbon; Peatlands; Shrubs; Wetlands,Biology; Biomass; Carbon; Allometric equations; Allometry; Biometry; Peat land; Shrubs; Wetlands; aboveground biomass; allometry; biomass; estimation method; phylogeny; shrub; Biology; Biomass; Biometrics; Carbon; Shrubs; Wetlands; Alnus; Betula pumila; Salix,,MDPI AG,19994907,,,,English,Forests,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053635701,

A class of cationic membrane lytic peptides has shown potential as an anticancer agent by inducing cancer cell death via membrane disruption; meanwhile, their intrinsic selectivity renders them as having low cytotoxicity towards noncancerous cells. Here, we report the use of a cationic peptide amphiphile (PA), named PAH6, to load doxorubicin (Dox) that is intercalated in an ATP-binding aptamer-incorporated DNA scaffold. The PA contains a cationic lytic sequence, (KLAKLAK) 2 , a polyhistidine segment for the proton sponge effect, and a hydrophobic alkyl tail to drive the self-assembly. Dox-loaded DNA was found to form a spherical nanocomplex (NC) with PAH6 with particle sizes below 100 nm at various ratios. Since the carrier PAH6 is also a therapeutic agent, the drug loadings of the NC reached up to ~86% within the ratios we tested, and Dox was released from the NC in an ATP-rich environment. In vitro studies indicate that the presence of PAH6 could permeabilize cell membranes and kill cells through fast membrane disruption and depolarization of mitochondrial membranes. The cytotoxicity tests were conducted using A549 nonsmall cell lung cancer cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells. PAH6 showed selectivity towards A549 cells. Significantly, the Dox-DNA/PAH6 NC exhibited a synergistic effect against A549 cells, with the IC50 decreased up to ~90% for Dox and ~69% for PAH6 when compared to the IC50 values of the two components, respectively. Furthermore, the selectivity of PAH6 conferred to the complex an improved therapeutic index between A549 and NIH-3T3 cells. A 3D-cultured A549 spheroid model was adopted to test the capability of Dox-DNA/PAH6 for tumor penetration. The PAH6 or Dox-DNA/PAH6 complex was found to break the spheroids into pieces, while Dox-treated spheroids maintained their shapes. In summary, this work provides a new strategy for constructing nanomedicines using therapeutic agents to meet the features required by anticancer treatment. © 2018 by the authors.

And what underlying factors influence this shift? Insights are identified from a qualitative analysis of a 3-year residential smart grid project in a suburb of Toronto, Canada. Interviews evaluated whether participants experienced changes in their energy culture and identified underlying factors. In particular, the impacts of the project tools on participants' norms (attitudes and awareness towards energy management), material culture (technical changes) and energy practices (conservation/peak shifting actions) were assessed, and motivations and barriers towards energy management were identified. The effectiveness of engagement mechanisms (i.e., web portal, reminder emails, webinars, incentivized control programme, and weekly electricity reports) was also evaluated. By examining detailed qualitative feedback following a multi-year suburban smart grid project in Ontario this study aims to (1) assess the changes in energy culture over the duration of the 3-year project and to (2) assess the underlying factors influencing household energy consumption and asmart residentialenergy culture. Results: Findings from the interview were compared to the results of an initial project survey to identify longer-term influences on energy culture. Increases in self-reported awareness and practices were accounted for, with the web portal and individualized weekly feedback email reported most frequently as causes of change. While increased awareness was obtained, participants needed additional guidance to make substantial changes. Although participants were financially motivated, norms of lifestyle and convenience, as well as competing household values of energy management were the largest barriers to home energy management. Conclusions: This study showcases challenges for engaging homeowners with home energy management technologies due to norms as well as competing household interests. Nuanced findings as an outcome of this study framed around energy cultures can influence future studies on smart grid engagement and consumer behaviour with larger samples sizes. In particular, future studies can further investigate the motivations and barriers surrounding residential energy cultures, how to engage different 'cultures of consumption' within households, and elements to effectively educate consumers beyond disaggregated feedback. © 2018 The Author(s).",Conservation and demand management (CDM); Demand-side management (DSM); Energy cultures; Feedback; Household engagement; Smart grid; Time of use (TOU) pricing,Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electronic mail; Energy management; Energy utilization; Feedback; Housing; Motivation; Portals; Demand Side Management (DSM); Energy cultures; Household engagement; Smart grid; Time-of-use pricing; Smart power grids; alternative energy; consumption behavior; fuel consumption; household energy; household survey; material culture; participatory approach; qualitative analysis; questionnaire survey; residential energy; smart grid; sustainability; technological change; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto,,BioMed Central Ltd.,21920567,,,,English,Energy Sustainability Soc.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053263810,

Our objective was to examine variation in the associations between frailty and select 1-year health outcomes by caregiver distress and client sex among community-residing older care recipients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked population-based clinical and health administrative databases for all long-stay home care clients (n = 234,552) aged 66+ years assessed during April 2010-2013 in Ontario, Canada. Frailty was assessed using a previously validated 72-item frailty index (FI). Presence of caregiver distress was derived from clinical assessment items administered by trained home care assessors. Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to examine variations in the associations between frailty and outcomes of interest (mortality, nursing home [NH] placement, all-cause and prolonged hospitalization) by caregiver distress, with further model stratification by client sex. Results: Frailty prevalence varied little by sex (19.3% women, 19.9% men) despite significant sex-differences in clients' sociodemographic and health characteristics. In both sexes, frailty was significantly associated with all outcomes, particularly NH placement (RR = 3.84, 95%CI 3.75-3.93) and death (RR = 2.32, 95%CI 2.27-2.37), though risk ratios were greater for women. Caregiver distress was more common with increasing frailty and for male clients, and a significant independent predictor of NH placement and prolonged hospitalization in both sexes. The association between frailty and NH placement (but not other outcomes) varied by caregiver distress for both men and women (p < 0.001 interaction terms), showing a greater magnitude of association among clients without (vs. with) a distressed caregiver. Conclusions: As caregiver distress varies by client sex, represents a key driver of NH placement (even among relatively robust clients), and modifies the impact of other risk factors such as frailty, it should be routinely assessed. Further, sex-differences should be considered when developing and evaluating community-based services for older adults and their caregivers. © 2018 The Author(s).",Caregiver distress; Frailty; Gender; Home care; Hospitalization; Mortality; Nursing home; Retrospective cohort; Sex,,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712318,,,30208884,English,BMC Geriatr.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053224003,

Gravitational wave strain waveforms are extracted directly from the data using a filtering method that exploits the observed or expected time-dependent frequency content. Statistical analysis of residual noise, after filtering out spectral peaks (and considering finite bandwidth), shows no evidence of non-Gaussian behaviour. There is also no evidence of anomalous causal correlation between noise signals at the Hanford and Livingston sites. The extracted waveforms are consistent with black hole coalescence template waveforms provided by LIGO. Simulated events, with known signals injected into real noise, are used to determine uncertainties due to residual noise and demonstrate that our results are unbiased. Conceptual and numerical differences between our RMS signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and the published matched-filter detection SNRs are discussed. © 2018 The Authors",Black hole coalescence; Gravitational waves; Signal extraction,,,Elsevier B.V.,3702693,,PYLBA,,English,Phys Lett Sect B Nucl Elem Part High-Energy Phys,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052150142,

Thus, building façades must be rapidly inspected to prevent potential loss of life and property damage. Harnessing the capacity to use new vision sensors and associated sensing platforms, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would expedite this process and alleviate spatial and temporal limitations typically associated with human-based inspection in high-rise buildings. In this paper, we have developed an approach to perform rapid and accurate visual inspection of building façades using images collected from UAVs. An orthophoto corresponding to any reasonably flat region on the building (e.g., a façade or building side) is automatically constructed using a structure-from-motion (SfM) technique, followed by image stitching and blending. Based on the geometric relationship between the collected images and the constructed orthophoto, high-resolution region-of-interest are automatically extracted from the collected images, enabling efficient visual inspection. We successfully demonstrate the capabilities of the technique using an abandoned building of which a façade has damaged building components (e.g., window panes or external drainage pipes). © 2018 by the authors.

A miniature sized shear specimen was used in this work to perform high strain rate shear testing. Digital image correlation (DIC) techniques were employed to measure the strains in the experiments. At maximum in-plane shear strains greater than 20%, the AA7075-T6 alloy demonstrated a reduced work hardening rate at elevated strain rates. At lower strains, the AA7075-T6 alloy showed mild positive rate sensitivity. The strain to localization (using the Zener-Holloman criterion), measured using the DIC technique, decreased with strain rate in shear loading. The strain at complete failure, however, exhibited an increase at the highest strain rate (500 s-1). The current work also focused on characterization of the thermal conditions occurring during high rate loading in shear with in situ high speed thermal imaging. Experimental results from the highest strain rate (500 s-1) tests showed a notable increase in temperature within the specimen gauge region as a result of the conversion of plastic deformation energy into heat. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,,Cosculluela A.Cadoni E.Buzaud E.Couque H.,EDP Sciences,21016275,9.78276E+12,,,English,EPJ Web Conf.,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053699965,

Their increased strength allows for the reduction of sheet thickness, and thus a reduction in mass, while offering formability and cost advantages when compared to other metal alloys typically considered for lightweight applications. DP980 steels are AHSS being considered for structural energy absorbing components; however, there is a lack of published information on their high rate behaviour. This paper presents the results of an experimental program that characterized three production DP980 steels from three different manufacturers at strain rates of 0.001, 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 s-1. An electro-mechanical frame was used for the quasi-static tests, the 1, 10, and 100 s-1 tests were carried out using a fast hydraulic apparatus and the 1,000 s-1 experiments were carried out using a tensile split Hopkinson bar. The quasi-static hardening response at strains higher than the uniform elongation of about 7% was obtained by using a shear test, thus avoiding the use of inverse modelling techniques. The results indicate that the DP980 steels are moderately rate sensitive, with one of the materials showing higher sensitivity than the others. One of the materials exhibited a yield point phenomenon that appears to affect the behaviour of the material at 100 and 1,000 s-1, however, the reasons for this behaviour remain an open question. The data was fit to modified Johnson-Cook and Cowper-Symonds model to account for rate sensitivity. The results presented in this paper provide a tool for modelling the dynamic behaviour of DP980 steels. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,,Cosculluela A.Cadoni E.Buzaud E.Couque H.,EDP Sciences,21016275,9.78276E+12,,,English,EPJ Web Conf.,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053701347,

Surface rollers are shaped on the flow surface due to submerged hydraulic jump or any obstacles in the forced poolriffle units. Corner rollers are shaped close to the corners near the walls at the pool head. Ramp rollers are formed at the bed of the channel on the ramp into the head of the pool. All kinds of vortices stretch in the streamwise direction as they travel to the downstream, which they are called axial tails. The simulations showed that all four types of vortices interact with each other, combine, amplify or cancel out each other as they travel downstream. The strength of vortices and how they interact result into different types of flow patterns. The surface rollers combine with corner rollers to make a jet like plunging flow near the pool bed. In other cases with lower riffle heights, ramp rollers tend to push the flow up, which in turn leads to higher turbulence near the bed and higher velocity near the flow surface (skimming flow). Moreover, if both surface rollers and ramp rollers have the similar strength (e.g., vorticity) and scale, the streamwise velocity profile has a peak around the middle of the flow, and minimum velocities near the bed and free surface. This flow pattern was named as rifting flow. Based on these findings, a new hypothesis is proposed called 'vortex-resistance,' which states that the turbulent structures, by increasing the eddy viscosity and changing the pressure domain, act as an obstacle that steers the flow. Plunging and skimming flow can thus be understood as the products of different types of turbulent structures. These findings provide new clarifications to long-standing questions related to the hydraulics of pools and riffles. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,,Paquier A.Riviere N.,EDP Sciences,22671242,,,,English,E3S Web Conf.,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053787547,

However, sediment transport rate estimates are heuristic at best to within 1 - 3 orders of magnitude. Mimico Creek is an urban gravel-bed channel in Southern Ontario, Canada that has undergone intensive event-based sediment transport sampling and inter-event bed material particle tracking over a three-year period. A HEC-RAS model was developed of the study reach and calibrated to a series of discharge events where in-situ bedload sampling occurred. Both step-wise discharge and unsteady flow simulations were evaluated to compare sediment transport rates for a range of transport models which included the Meyer-Peter Müller and the Wilcock-Crowe. Calibration curves were developed to estimate sediment discharge in Mimico Creek. The results of the calibrated model were used to calculate the mean travel distance of bed material using the expression for the volumetric rate of bed material transport. Results from the modelling exercise found mean travel distances were similar and in some cases larger than those observed from field measurements, considering both mobile and immobile particles. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,,Paquier A.Riviere N.,EDP Sciences,22671242,,,,English,E3S Web Conf.,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053815373,

We are interested in how such a neural network might emerge from a biologically plausible learning rule. Other neural network learning methods either only apply to feedforward networks, or employ assumptions (such as weight copying) that render them unlikely in a real brain. Predictive estimators (PEs) offer a better solution to this bidirectional learning scenario. However, PEs also depend on weight copying. In this paper, we propose the symmetric PE (SPE), an architecture that can learn both feedforward and feedback connection weights individually using only locally available information. We demonstrate that the SPE can learn complicated mappings without the use of weight copying. The SPE networks also show promise in deeper architectures. © 2012 IEEE.",Backpropagation; learning; neural networks; predictive estimator (PE),Backpropagation; Biological systems; Brain models; Feedback; Flow visualization; Network architecture; Neural networks; Neurons; Sensory perception; Biological system modeling; Feed-forward network; Feedback connection; Feedforward systems; learning; Learning scenarios; Neural network learning; predictive estimator (PE); Feedforward neural networks,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,2162237X,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

Pore size and their volume distribution, and surface area were characterized using BET technique to correlate pore effect and surface area on RBd. Bounds for effective thermal conductivity were determined using Lipton-Vernescu model. Variation of thermal conductance with respect to temperature was studied and compared with the results of other materials. According to EMPT, RBd in Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6/SiC composites ranged from 3.84 × 10-7 to 5.42 × 10-7 m2KW-1 and 3.36 × 10-7 to 3.86 × 10-7 m2KW-1 for Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6/Al2O3 composites. Kapitza radius (aK) for SiC samples was ranged between 2.01 - 2.84 ?m; for Al2O3 samples it was 1.86 ?m. Hasselman-Johnson model gave RBd values 55%, 51%, and 8% more than what EMPT is predicting, but of the same order and aK values 3.5 ?m, 4 ?m, 3 ?m for SiC samples and 1.2 ?m, 0.6 ?m, 0.55 ?m for Al2O3 samples. Nan-Birringer model yielded large aK of 7.25 ?m and RBd ? 1.4 × 10-6 m2KW-1 for Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6/SiC. So obtained parameters are reasonable estimates. Variation of effective thermal conductivity in Al2O3 samples is more sensitive to particle size compared to SiC samples.

They define a new concept: phylogenetically diverse noncultured cells (PDNC). Unlike viable but nonculturable cells (VBNC), PDNC are microorganisms for which traditional isolation techniques may never succeed.

A 3.5 W continuous wave laser was used to ignite the samples in argon at atmospheric pressure, and a high speed camera captured the flame propagation. The high speed images revealed that the fast laser heating creates significant material ablation, followed by heat transfer along the heated surface. The bulk ignition occurs near the edge of the top surface, followed by the self-sustained burning. Lightly pressed powders (90% porosity) ignited in ~0.1 ms and the burning front propagated at around 200 m/s, while the dense pellets (40-60% porosity) ignited in ~1 ms and the burning front propagated at around 10 m/s. These results indicate that the reaction mechanism changes from mass convection to heat diffusion with increasing the packing density. The ignition and burn speeds of these Al/CuO nanothermites at different equivalence ratios (ERs), along with SEM images of pre- and post-combustion, illustrate that the homogeneity of the mixture is a critical parameter for optimizing the performance. The Al rich mixtures show significantly lower ignition delays and higher burn speeds. © 2018 Saceleanu, Idir, Chaumeix and Wen.",Flame propagation; Heterogeneous combustion; Laser ignition; Nanoparticle; Nanothermite reaction,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,22962646,,,,English,Front.

Higher microbial diversity was observed within the dump leachate, with members of the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Tenericutes being the most abundant, while the river community was dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. The microbial communities exhibit similar functional potential profiles, including chemoorganoheterotrophy as the dominant metabolism, and the potential to degrade aromatic compounds. From reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), organisms within both environments are predicted to survive in the presence of multiple antibiotics, antiseptics, biocides, and metals. Strong virulence potential coincided with the most diverse multiple resistance profiles in 1 of 5 leachate MAGs and 5 of 33 river MAGs. Unexpectedly, the microbial resistance profiles were more varied and widespread in the river populations, where we had expected the chemical composition of the leachate to select and enrich for resistance characteristics. This study provides valuable insights into the total functional potential of a landfill leachate microbial community and identifies possible human health hazards within the Duhaney River and Riverton City dump, urban environments with the potential to impact human populations. © 2018 Collins-Fairclough et al.",Antibiotic resistance; Biocide resistance; Contamination; Metagenomics; Metal resistance; Microbial diversity; Municipal solid waste; River,"antiinfective agent; disinfectant agent; metal; analysis; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; chemistry; city; classification; environmental monitoring; Jamaica; metagenomics; microbiology; phylogeny; river; waste disposal; water pollutant; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Cities; Disinfectants; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Environmental Monitoring; Jamaica; Metagenomics; Metals; Phylogeny; Refuse Disposal; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,American Society for Microbiology,23795042,,,30258036,English,mSphere,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054384526,

While the RB decay rate is known to enable estimates of the average fidelity of those operations under gate-independent Markovian noise, under gate-dependent noise this rate is more difficult to interpret rigorously. In this paper, we prove that single-qubit RB decay parameter p coincides with the decay parameter of the gate-set circuit fidelity, a novel figure of merit which characterizes the expected average fidelity over arbitrary circuits of operations from the gate-set. We also prove that, in the limit of high-fidelity single-qubit experiments, the possible alarming disconnect between the average gate fidelity and RB experimental results is simply explained by a basis mismatch between the gates and the state-preparation and measurement procedures, that is, to a unitary degree of freedom in labeling the Pauli matrices. Based on numerical evidence and physically motivated arguments, we conjecture that these results also hold for higher dimensions. © 2018 The Author(s).

To assess the effect of cathodic pH on H2O2 yield, the MEC was tested with an anion exchange membrane (AEM) and a cation exchange membrane (CEM), respectively. The maximum current density reached 0.940.96 A/m2 in the MEC at applied voltage of 0.351.9 V, regardless of membranes. The highest H2O2 conversion efficiency was only 7.2 ± 0.09% for the CEM-MEC. This low conversion would be due to further H2O2 reduction to H2O on the cathode or H2O2 decomposition in bulk liquid.

Local governments are recognizing the opportunity of this paradigm shift to improve services, create more efficient policies, and increase the wellbeing of their citizens. These new tools create the possibility for local governments to respond differently to wicked problems facing cities, including increasing chronic disease prevalence. Using lung and skin cancers as case studies, we present smart prevention as a novel approach that uses smart city-enabled built environment monitoring to trigger local cancer-prevention policies. First, we present results of a scoping review we conducted to describe mechanisms by which features in urban built and social environments are hypothesized to contribute to lung cancer and skin cancer. We systematically searched fourteen electronic databases, yielding 47 articles that examined associations between built and social environment features and lung cancer (n = 34), and/or built and social environment features and skin cancer (n = 13). Second, we present a narrative review of smart city theory and governance. Third, we use findings from both reviews to draw conceptual links between cancer prevention and SCC  presenting a hypothetical suite of built environment and policy interventions to prevent lung and skin cancer. © 2018 The Authors",Cancer prevention; Public policy; Scoping review; Smart cities; Urban health; Urban planning,cancer; disease control; disease prevalence; environmental monitoring; governance approach; health care; health policy; local government; smart city; urban planning; urban policy,,Elsevier Ltd,2642751,,,,English,Cities,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042869003,

Eyeblink conditioning is often used experimentally to detect abnormalities in cerebellar-dependent learning and memory that underlies this type of associative learning. While experiments in adults and older children are relatively simple to administer using commercial equipment, eyeblink conditioning in infants is more challenging due to their poor compliance, which makes correct positioning of the equipment difficult. To achieve conditioning in one-year-old infants, a custom-made or an adapted commercial system can be used to deliver the air puff to the infant's cornea. The main challenge lies in successfully detecting and classifying the behavioral responses. We report that automated blink detection methods are unreliable in this population, and that conditioning experiments should be analyzed using frame-by-frame analysis of supplementary video camera recordings. This method can be applied to study developmental changes in eyeblink conditioning and to examine whether this paradigm can detect children with neurological disorders. © 2018, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

While optical coherence tomography angiography provides an en face depiction of the choroidal vasculature, it does not reveal flow dynamics. In this report, we describe the use of plane-wave ultrasound to image and characterize choroidal blood flow. Methods: We scanned both eyes of 12 healthy subjects in a horizontal plane superior to the optic nerve head using an 18-MHz linear array. Plane-wave data were acquired over 10 transmission angles that were coherently compounded to produce 1000 images/sec for 3 seconds. These data were processed to produce a time series of power Doppler images and spectrograms depicting choroidal flow velocity. Analysis of variance was used to characterize peak systolic, and end diastolic velocities and resistive index, and their variability between scans, eyes, and subjects. Results: Power Doppler images showed distinct arterioles within a more diffuse background. Choroidal flow was moderately pulsatile, with peak systolic velocity averaging approximately 10 mm/sec and resistive index of 0.55. There was no significant difference between left and right eyes, but significant variation among subjects. Conclusions: Plane-wave ultrasound visualized individual arterioles and allowed measurement of flow over the cardiac cycle. Characterization of choroidal flow dynamics offers a novel means for assessment of the choroids role in ocular disease.

To determine whether attention is biased toward the nonamblyopic eye under binocular viewing conditions in adults with anisometropic or strabismic amblyopia. We first determined whether attention could be allocated preferentially to one eye in visually normal observers performing a dichoptic attentive motion tracking task. We then assessed dichoptic attentive motion tracking in amblyopia. METHODS. Participants performed a multiple-object tracking task under the following three viewing conditions: target dots to the dominant eye and distractor dots to the nondominant eye (DE condition), vice versa (NDE condition), or all dots to both eyes (binocular condition). Interocular attentional asymmetry scores were computed as the difference in accuracy between DE and NDE conditions. An interocular contrast difference favoring the amblyopic eye was used for all conditions to neutralize amblyopic eye suppression. To test for confounding effects of suppression, participants completed a separate dot enumeration task under dichoptic presentation conditions to obtain an interocular enumeration asymmetry score. RESULTS. Participants with normal vision demonstrated similar accuracy between the DE and NDE conditions and exhibited slightly impaired performance under dichoptic compared with binocular viewing conditions. Participants with strabismic/mixed amblyopia had significantly higher interocular attentional asymmetry than participants with normal vision or with anisometropic amblyopia, whereby attention was biased toward the nonamblyopic eye. The latter two groups did not exhibit a bias in interocular attention. No interocular asymmetries for the enumeration task were observed for any group. CONCLUSIONS. A nonamblyopic eye bias in the interocular allocation of attention may contribute to the binocular vision impairments caused by strabismic amblyopia. © 2018 The Authors.",Amblyopia; Binocular vision; Strabismus; Suppression; Visual attention,"accuracy; adult; amblyopia; anisometropia; Article; best corrected visual acuity; binocular vision; controlled study; depth perception; eye tracking; female; human; male; middle aged; optometry; priority journal; refraction error; strabismus; task performance; vision; visual acuity; visual stimulation; aged; amblyopia; attention; eye movement; movement perception; pathophysiology; perceptive threshold; photostimulation; physiology; statistical bias; young adult; Adult; Aged; Amblyopia; Attention; Bias; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motion Perception; Photic Stimulation; Sensory Thresholds; Strabismus; Vision, Binocular; Visual Acuity; Young Adult",,Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.,1460404,,IOVSD,30242356,English,Invest.

The potential to offset the social, economic, and personal burdens associated with such conditions depends on our ability to influence peoples thought processes, decisions, and behaviors, all of which can be understood with reference to the brain itself. Within the health neuroscience framework, the brain can be viewed as a predictor, mediator, moderator, or outcome in relation to health-related phenomena. This review explores examples of each of these, with specific reference to the primary prevention (i.e., prevention of initial onset) of chronic diseases. Within the topic of primary prevention, we touch on several cross-cutting themes (persuasive communications, delay discounting of rewards, and self-control), and place a special focus on obesity as a disorder influenced by both eating behavior and exercise habits. © 2018 New York Academy of Sciences.",Behavior; Brain; Communication; Disease; Neuroscience; Prevention; Prevention neuroscience,"brain; chronic disease; delay discounting; eating; exercise; feeding behavior; food intake; human; neurobiology; neuroimaging; neuromodulation; persuasive communication; physical activity; population health; primary prevention; prophylaxis; Review; reward; self concept; self control; association; chronic disease; forecasting; health behavior; mortality; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; pleasure; primary prevention; agents interacting with transmitter, hormone or drug receptors; Brain; Chronic Disease; Cues; Delay Discounting; Exercise; Feeding Behavior; Forecasting; Health Behavior; Humans; Neuroimaging; Neurotransmitter Agents; Obesity; Persuasive Communication; Pleasure; Primary Prevention; Reward; Self-Control",,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,778923,,ANYAA,29863790,English,Ann.

Yet, whole genome sequencing for detection of mutation clusters is prohibitive with high cost for most organisms and population surveys. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays, like the Mouse Diversity Genotyping Array, offer an alternative low-cost, screening for mutations at hundreds of thousands of loci across the genome using experimental designs that permit capture of de novo mutations in any tissue. Formal statistical tools for genome-wide detection of mutation clusters under a microarray probe sampling system are yet to be established. A challenge in the development of statistical methods is that microarray detection of mutation clusters is constrained to select SNP loci captured by probes on the array. This paper develops a Monte Carlo framework for cluster testing and assesses test statistics for capturing potential deviations from spatial randomness which are motivated by, and incorporate, the array design. While null distributions of the test statistics are established under spatial randomness via the homogeneous Poisson process, power performance of the test statistics is evaluated under postulated types of Neyman-Scott clustering processes through Monte Carlo simulation. A new statistic is developed and recommended as a screening tool for mutation cluster detection. The statistic is demonstrated to be excellent in terms of its robustness and power performance, and useful for cluster analysis in settings of missing data. The test statistic can also be generalized to any one dimensional system where every site is observed, such as DNA sequencing data. The paper illustrates how the informal graphical tools for detecting clusters may be misleading. The statistic is used for finding clusters of putative SNP differences in a mixture of different mouse genetic backgrounds and clusters of de novo SNP differences arising between tissues with development and carcinogenesis. © 2018 Luo et al.

The inversion kernel consists of a two-port transmission line forward model in the frequency domain and a constitutive material equation based on a power law soil mixture rule (Complex Refractive Index Model - CRIM). The spatially-distributed retrieval of broadband dielectric spectra was achieved with a global optimization approach based on a Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) algorithm using the full set of the scattering parameters. For each layer, the broadband dielectric spectra were retrieved with the corresponding parameters thickness, porosity, water saturation and electrical conductivity of the aqueous pore solution. For the validation of the approach, a coaxial transmission line cell measured with a network analyzer was used. The possibilities and limitations of the inverse parameter estimation were numerically analyzed in four scenarios. Expected and retrieved layer thicknesses, soil properties and broadband dielectric spectra in each scenario were in reasonable agreement. Hence, the model is suitable for an estimation of in-homogeneous material parameter distributions. Moreover, the proposed frequency domain approach allows an automatic adaptation of layer number and thickness or regular grids in time and/or space. © 2018 by the authors.

However, monitoring and enforcement problems may be overcome by encouraging resource users to develop, endorse, and subsequently enforce conservation regulations. In this article, we draw upon the literature on common-pool resources and social networks to assess the impacts of participation and network ties on the decisions of fishers to voluntarily report rule violations in two Jamaican marine reserves. Data was collected using questionnaires administered through personal interviews with fishers (n = 277). The results suggest that local fishers are more likely to report illegal fishing if they had participated in conservation planning and if they are directly linked to community-based wardens in information sharing networks. This research extends well-established findings regarding the role and impacts of participation on biodiversity conservation by highlighting the importance of synergies between participation and social networks for voluntary monitoring of conservation regulations. © 2018 The Authors.

However, the effects of inserts with such efficacy messages have not been studied using experimental designs. This study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to assess smokers' responses to efficacy inserts. METHODS In a randomized case-crossover study among smokers from the United States (n=23), participants received a one-week supply of cigarettes with efficacy inserts and a one-week supply without any inserts, and were randomized to use the packs with inserts on either the first or second week of the study. For 14 consecutive days, participants used a smartphone to answer brief surveys on cessation-related variables during smoking sessions and at the beginning of each day. Multilevel mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models compared responses during the insert period to those of the non-insert period. RESULTS The insert period was associated with greater desire to quit (b=0.21, p=0.012), motivation to quit (b=0.18, p=0.001), self-efficacy to cut down (b=0.26, p<0.001) and to quit (b=0.28, p<0.000), and response efficacy/perceived benefits of quitting (b=0.13, p=0.012). Insert exposure was not significantly associated with forgoing cigarettes (OR=1.9, p=0.2). CONCLUSIONS Results from this EMA study suggest that inserts with efficacy messages may promote determinants of smoking cessation. This is consistent with observational research in Canada, which is the only country to use inserts with efficacy messages as well as pictorial warnings about smoking risks on the outside of packs. Future studies should assess the extent to which efficacy inserts can not only be used to communicate health information to smokers but also work in synergy with pictorial warnings. © 2018 Lambert V.",Health communication; Health policy; Smoking cessation; Tobacco control,,,International Society for the Prevention of Tobacco Induced Diseases,16179625,,,,English,Tob.

They are written as integrals over the moduli space of certain rational maps localized on the (n ? 3)! solutions of the scattering equations. Due to the properties of spinor-helicity variables in six dimensions, the even-n and odd-n formulas are quite different and have to be treated separately. We first propose a manifestly supersymmetric expression for the even-n amplitudes of N= (1 1) SYM theory and perform various consistency checks. By considering soft-gluon limits of the even-n amplitudes, we deduce the form of the rational maps and the integrand for n odd. The odd-n formulas obtained in this way have a new redundancy that is intertwined with the usual SL(2, ?) invariance on the Riemann sphere. We also propose an alternative form of the formulas, analogous to the Witten-RSV formulation, and explore its relationship with the symplectic (or Lagrangian) Grassmannian. Since the amplitudes are formulated in a way that manifests double-copy properties, formulas for the six-dimensional N= (2 2) SUGRA amplitudes follow. These six-dimensional results allow us to deduce new formulas for five-dimensional SYM and SUGRA amplitudes, as well as massive amplitudes of four-dimensional N= 4 SYM on the Coulomb branch. © 2018, The Author(s).",Field Theories in Higher Dimensions; Scattering Amplitudes; Supersymmetric Gauge Theory,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

However, more limited work has addressed Neoarchean processes elsewhere in West Greenland. In particular, conflicting models have been proposed for the tectonothermal history of the Akia terrane, to the north of the Nuuk region. In this study, the depositional and metamorphic history of supracrustal rocks in the Akia terrane have been investigated using field relationships, petrography, phase equilibria modelling, and zircon and apatite U-Pb geochronology. The Akia terrane is a Palaeo- to Mesoarchean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) gneiss terrane with subordinate supracrustal rocks, mafic to ultramafic intrusions  all metamorphosed at amphibolite to granulite facies  Proterozoic mafic dyke suites, Neoproterozoic and Jurassic kimberlitic rocks, and a Mesoarchean and a Jurassic carbonatite. Some of the supracrustal rocks are known to be Mesoarchean, whilst others lack age constraint. New detrital and metamorphic zircon ages show that the metasedimentary rocks studied  the Kangerluarsuk Supracrustal Belt  were sourced from TTG gneisses within the host Akia terrane and deposited in the period ?2877 Ma to ?2857 Ma; this requires exhumation of the Akia terrane after c. 30102970 Ma magmatism and low-pressure granulite facies metamorphism. After exhumation, the Kangerluarsuk Supracrustal Belt was buried and underwent prolonged high-temperature metamorphism, reaching ?820850 °C and 810 kbar during regional ductile deformation in the period 28572700 Ma. The same rocks grew metamorphic zircon and neoblastic apatite at c. 2630 Ma and >450 to <850 °C, based on U-Pb geochronology and Pb diffusion modelling respectively. This evidence of Neoarchean metamorphism of the Akia terrane shows that a large part of West Greenland was in tectonic communication and experienced common high temperature conditions in the latest Mesoarchean to early Neoarchean and by c. 2700 Ma. The recognition of prolonged Neoarchean high-temperature metamorphism and partial melting during regional ductile deformation raises questions about the veracity of textural evidence for a giant bolide impact at ?3000 Ma in the same region as such evidence would likely have been obliterated through such pervasive metamorphic and tectonic reworking. © 2018 The Authors",Apatite; Geochronology; Granulite facies; Pseudosections; Zircon,apatite; Archean; deposition; exhumation; geochronology; granulite facies; metamorphism; petrography; phase equilibrium; supracrustal rock; terrane; uranium-lead dating; zircon; Arctic; Greenland; Nuuk; West Greenland,,Elsevier B.V.,3019268,,PCBRB,,English,Precambrian Res.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048249174,

In parts of Cambodia, irrigation with groundwater results in arsenic accumulation in soils and rice, leading to health concerns associated with rice consumption. A high concentration of iron in groundwater can precipitate arsenic and reduce its bioavailability, however high concentrations of arsenic and iron can also reduce rice production. Furthermore, concerns have been raised about chemical contamination from inorganic fertilizers used to grow rice. The relationship between soil geochemistry and arsenic concentrations in rice is not yet fully understood. Objectives. The primary objective of this project was to investigate the relationship between arsenic concentrations in irrigation water, soil and rice collected from different sites in Cambodia. A secondary objective was to explore arsenic and phosphorus levels in fertilizer samples obtained from the study area in Cambodia. Methods. The present study collected 61 well water samples, 105 rice samples, 70 soil samples, 11 inorganic fertilizer samples and conducted interviews with 44 families along the Mekong River in Cambodia. Analyses for metals, total arsenic, and arsenic species in the water and rice were conducted in Canada by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Analyses for metals, total arsenic and phosphorus in soils and inorganic fertilizers were conducted in Cambodia and Singapore by X-ray fluorescence. Results. The concentration of arsenic in rice paddy soils was highly variable and as much as 20 times higher near the irrigation wells than in more distal areas of the paddy. Two farmers in Preak Russey had integrated soil samples with arsenic levels above the concentration associated with toxicity to rice in Taiwan (40 mg/kg) and above the Dutch concentration requiring intervention or remediation (55 mg/kg). The highest total arsenic measured in soil was 95 mg/kg. In Preak Russey, the loading of arsenic from irrigation water was 3710 times greater than the loading of arsenic from inorganic fertilizers. Half of the commercial inorganic fertilizers had less than 50% of the labelled content of phosphorus. Conclusions. Emphasis should be placed on improving the management of irrigation water, not on inactivation of arsenic in soil. The high levels of iron in groundwater mitigate arsenic toxicity, but the accumulation of iron could later result in lower rice productivity. Irrigation of rice with groundwater is not likely sustainable. To improve rice productivity, the content of phosphorus in local inorganic fertilizers must be improved to world standards. X-ray fluorescence analysis can quickly identify poor quality fertilizers. Informed Consent. Obtained Competing Interests.

Arsenic bioaccumulation in rice is a global concern affecting food security and public health. Objective. The present study examined arsenic species in rice in Cambodia to characterize health risks with rice consumption and to clarify uncertainties with Codex guidelines. Methods. The present study collected 61 well water samples, 105 rice samples, 70 soil samples, and conducted interviews with 44 families in Preak Russey near the Bassac River and Kandal Province along the Mekong River in Cambodia. Analyses of metals, total arsenic and arsenic species were conducted in laboratories in Canada, Cambodia and Singapore. Results. Unlike in Bangladesh, rice with the highest total arsenic concentrations in Cambodia contains mostly organic arsenic, dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), which is unregulated and much less toxic than inorganic arsenic. The present study found that storing surface runoff in ditches prior to irrigation can significantly reduce the arsenic concentration in rice. It is possible to remove > 95% of arsenic from groundwater prior to irrigation with natural reactions. Conclusions. The provision of high quality drinking water in 2015 to Preak Russey removed about 95% of the dietary inorganic arsenic exposure. The extremes in arsenic toxicity that are still obvious in these farmers should become less common. Rice from the site with the highest documented levels of arsenic in soils and water in Cambodia passes current Codex guidelines for arsenic. Informed Consent. Obtained Competing Interests.

Considering the growing problem of polypharmacy, increasing attention has been paid to how and when medication-related decisions should be coordinated across multidisciplinary care teams. Improved knowledge on how integrated electronic health records (EHRs) can support interprofessional shared decision-making for medication therapy management is necessary to continue improving patient care. Objective: The objective of our study was to examine how physicians and pharmacists understand and communicate patient-focused medication information with each other and how this knowledge can influence the design of EHRs. Methods: This study is part of a broader cross-Canada study between patients and health care providers around how medication-related decisions are made and communicated. We visited community pharmacies, team-based primary care clinics, and independent-practice family physician clinics throughout Ontario, Nova Scotia, Alberta, and Quebec. Research assistants conducted semistructured interviews with physicians and pharmacists. A modified version of the Multidisciplinary Framework Method was used to analyze the data. Results: We collected data from 19 pharmacies and 9 medical clinics and identified 6 main themes from 34 health care professionals. First, Interprofessional Shared Decision-Making was not occurring and clinicians made decisions based on their understanding of the patient. Physicians and pharmacists reported indirect Communication, incomplete Information specifically missing insight into indication and adherence, and misaligned Processes of Care that were further compounded by EHRs that are not designed to facilitate collaboration. Scope of Practice examined professional and workplace boundaries for pharmacists and physicians that were internally and externally imposed. Physicians decided on the degree of the Physician-Pharmacist Relationship, often predicated by colocation. Conclusions: We observed limited communication and collaboration between primary care providers and pharmacists when managing medications. Pharmacists were missing key information around reason for use, and physicians required accurate information around adherence. EHRs are a potential tool to help clinicians communicate information to resolve this issue. EHRs need to be designed to facilitate interprofessional medication management so that pharmacists and physicians can move beyond task-based work toward a collaborative approach. © Kathryn Mercer, Catherine Burns, Lisa Guirguis, Jessie Chin, Maman Joyce Dogba, Lisa Dolovich, Line Guénette, Laurie Jenkins, France Légaré, Annette McKinnon, Josephine McMurray, Khrystine Waked, Kelly A Grindrod.

We used breeding habitat metrics, landscape attributes, and indices of grouse abundance, to compare fit between structural connectivity and genetic differentiation within five long-established Sage-Grouse Management Zones (MZ) I-V using microsatellite genotypes from 6,844 greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) collected across their 10.7 million-km2 range. We estimated structural connectivity using a circuit theory-based approach where we built resistance surfaces using thresholds dividing the landscape into habitat and nonhabitat and nodes were clusters of sage-grouse leks (where feather samples were collected using noninvasive techniques). As hypothesized, MZ-specific habitat metrics were the best predictors of differentiation. To our surprise, inclusion of grouse abundance-corrected indices did not greatly improve model fit in most MZs. Functional connectivity of breeding habitat was reduced when probability of lek occurrence dropped below 0.25 (MZs I, IV) and 0.5 (II), thresholds lower than those previously identified as required for the formation of breeding leks, which suggests that individuals are willing to travel through undesirable habitat. The individual MZ landscape results suggested terrain roughness and steepness shaped functional connectivity across all MZs. Across respective MZs, sagebrush availability (&lt;10%30%; II, IV, V), tree canopy cover (&gt;10%; I, II, IV), and cultivation (&gt;25%; I, II, IV, V) each reduced movement beyond their respective thresholds. Model validations confirmed variation in predictive ability across MZs with top resistance surfaces better predicting gene flow than geographic distance alone, especially in cases of low and high differentiation among lek groups. The resultant resistance maps we produced spatially depict the strength and redundancy of range-wide gene flow and can help direct conservation actions to maintain and restore functional connectivity for sage-grouse. © 2018 The Authors.

Measuring cognitive function by standardized tests, however, is biased toward highly constrained environments (such as hospitals) in selected samples. Patient-powered real-world evidence using information and communication technology devices, including environmental and wearable sensors, may help to overcome these limitations. This position paper describes current and novel information and communication technology devices and algorithms to monitor behavior and function in people with prodromal and manifest stages of dementia continuously, and discusses clinical, technological, ethical, regulatory, and user-centered requirements for collecting real-world evidence in future randomized controlled trials. Challenges of data safety, quality, and privacy and regulatory requirements need to be addressed by future smart sensor technologies. When these requirements are satisfied, these technologies will provide access to truly user relevant outcomes and broader cohorts of participants than currently sampled in clinical trials. © 2018 The Authors",,algorithm; behavior change; clinical assessment; clinical research; clinical trial (topic); cognition; communication skill; computer analysis; dementia; evidence based practice; human; information and communication technology; information technology; measurement accuracy; medical ethics; medical information; outcome assessment; patient monitoring; patient safety; priority journal; privacy; prodromal symptom; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); Short Survey,,Elsevier Inc.,15525260,,,29936147,English,Alzheimer's Dementia,Short Survey,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052867258,

Their applications in biosensor development, drug delivery, and catalysis have been explored. Lanthanides and nucleotides can form interesting CPs, although most previous works have focused on a single type of metal ligand. In this work, we explored mixed nucleotides and studied their DNA adsorption properties using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) formed negatively charged CP nanoparticles with most lanthanides, and thus a salt was required to adsorb negatively charged DNA. DNA adsorption was faster and reached a higher capacity with lighter lanthanides. Desorption of pre-adsorbed DNA by inorganic phosphates, urea, proteins, surfactants, and competing DNA was successively carried out. The results suggested the importance of the DNA phosphate backbone, although hydrogen bonding and DNA bases also contributed to adsorption. The AMP CPs adsorbed DNA more strongly than the GMP ones, and using mixtures of AMP and GMP, continuous tuning of DNA adsorption affinity was achieved. Such CPs were also used as a sensor for DNA detection based on the different affinities of single- and double-stranded DNA, and a detection limit of 0.9 nM target DNA was achieved. Instead of tuning DNA adsorption by varying the length and sequence of DNA, the composition of CPs can also be controlled to achieve this goal. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,,,American Chemical Society,24701343,,,,English,ACS Omega,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051740237,

A high-dose Li-ion implantation induced the formation of electron trap centers inside the diamond grains and amorphous carbon (a-C) phases in grain boundaries for both types of NCD films. Postannealing at 1000 °C healed the defects, eliminated the electron trap centers, and converted the a-C into nanographitic phases.

However, people spend most of their time indoors, particularly in office buildings. Poor employee mental health has become one the most prevalent and costly occupational health issues. The integration of high quality environmental features (e.g., access to sunlight) in green-certified office buildings offers a superior work environment. These nature-based experiences are anticipated to provide beneficial outcomes to wellbeing. This study is the first to empirically investigate these benefits. Participants in a green (LEED gold certified) office building (N = 213) in Canada completed an assessment of environmental features, measures of hedonic, eudaimonic and negative wellbeing (NWB) and assessments of psycho-environmental potential, environmental behaviors and social belonging. Linear regression analyses confirmed the benefits of indoor environmental features for all aspects of wellbeing. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to assess the effect of specific indoor environmental features on wellbeing. We explored physical features (e.g., air quality, light), and social features (e.g., privacy), as well as windows to the outside. Results suggest that physical features are important in promoting hedonic wellbeing, while social features prevent NWB. Both features equally predicted eudaimonic wellbeing (EWB). A view to the outside was positively correlated to wellbeing, although it did not uniquely predict it after accounting for other environmental features. Path analyses revealed the importance of person-environment fit, pro-environmental behavior and social belonging in mediating the association of indoor environmental features with hedonic and EWB. The results suggests that, by fostering person-environment fit, pro-environmental behaviors and feeling of community in a high quality setting, green buildings may lead to benefits on an array of wellbeing dimensions. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. © 2018 Dreyer, Coulombe, Whitney, Riemer and Labbé.",Employee mental health; Green buildings; High-performance green buildings; Indoor environmental features; Nature exposure; Wellbeing,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,16641078,,,,English,Front.

It is present from infancy onward, and plays a role in functions from language learning to selective attention. Despite these observations, there are few data on whether statistical learning capacity changes with age or after brain injury. In order to examine how brain injury affects the ability to learn and update statistical representations, we had young control and healthy elder participants, as well as participants with either left or right brain injury, perform an auditory statistical learning task. Participants listened to two languages with made-up words that were defined by the transition probability between syllables. Following passive listening, learning was assessed with a two-alternative forced choice test for the most familiar word. As in previous studies, we found that young controls have a learning capacity limitation for statistical learning; a second language is less well learned than the first, and this statistical learning capacity limit is attenuated with age. Additionally, we found that brain damaged patients, whether with left or right hemispheric damage, showed impaired statistical learning. This impairment was not explained by aphasia or cognitive deficits. As statistical learning is a critical skill for daily life, a better appreciation of the nature of this impairment will improve our understanding of the cognitive effects of brain injury and could lead to new rehabilitation strategies. © 2018 Shaqiri, Danckert, Burnett and Anderson.",Language; Neglect; Rehabilitation; Statistical learning; Stroke,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,16625161,,,,English,Front.

The proposed filters use slotted patch microstrip resonator based on quasi fractal geometry, simulated by AWR12 software package. Both filters have quasi elliptic frequency responses, designed at centre frequency of 2.437 GHz for bandpass filter and at band frequencies of 2.434, 4.032, 4.976 and 5.638 GHz GHz respectively, for multi band bandstop filter. All filters are employed using RT/Duroid 6010.8 LM substrate of 10.8 dielectric constant and 1.27 mm dielectric thickness. Simulation results show that the designed quasi fractal bandpass filter has very narrow fractional bandwidth of 0.38 % which is very rare in microstrip filter design. On the other hand, the projected bandstop filter offers multi narrow rejection bands that is useful in broadband wireless schemes influencing from fixed interferences. Both filters present satisfactory S11 and S21 responses besides smallness properties that stand for interesting features of the newest wireless applications.

The stable isotopic results show groundwater in the basin originates from precipitation and meltwater in the mountainous areas of the Tibetan Plateau. Modern water was found in the alluvial fan and shallow aquifers of the loess plain. Deep confined groundwater was recharged by paleowater during the late Pleistocene and Holocene under a cold climate. Groundwater in the low-lying depression of the central basin is composed of paleobrines migrated from the western part of the basin due to tectonic uplift in the geological past. Groundwater chemistry is controlled by mineral dissolution (halite, gypsum, anhydrite, mirabilite), silicate weathering, cation exchange, evaporation and mineral precipitation (halite, gypsum, anhydrite, aragonite, calcite, dolomite) and varies from fresh to brine with the water types evolving from HCO3 Cl-Ca M Na to Cl-Na, Cl-K-Na and Cl-Mg type along the flow path. Groundwater flow patterns are closely related to stratigraphic control and lithological distribution. Three hierarchical groundwater flow systems, namely local, intermediate and regional, were identified using numerical modeling. The quantity of water discharge from these three systems accounts for approximately 83 14 and 3 respectively, of the total groundwater quantity of the watershed. This study can enhance the understanding of groundwater origin, circulation and evolution in the Qaidam Basin as well as other arid endorheic watersheds in northwestern China and elsewhere worldwide. © Author(s) 2018.",,Aquifers; Calcite; Chloride minerals; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Gypsum; Hierarchical systems; Hydrogeology; Ion exchange; Isotopes; Lithology; Magnesium compounds; Potassium compounds; Silicates; Sodium chloride; Stratigraphy; Watersheds; Weathering; Geochemical evolution; Groundwater chemistry; Groundwater flow systems; Groundwater origins; Mineral dissolution; Mineral precipitation; Numerical approaches; Silicate weathering; Hydrochemistry; dissolution; evaporation; flow pattern; geochemical survey; groundwater flow; hydrogeochemistry; ion exchange; mineral deposit; numerical model; silicate; water quality; watershed; weathering; China; Golmud River; Qaidam Basin; Qinghai; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau,,Copernicus GmbH,10275606,,,,English,Hydrol.

However, generic wireless sensor units, patient health and state monitoring sensors, and smart phones and watches that contain sensors can be differently oriented on the body. The vast majority of the existing algorithms are not robust against placing the sensor units at variable orientations. We propose a method that transforms the recorded motion sensor sequences invariantly to sensor unit orientation. The method is based on estimating the sensor unit orientation and representing the sensor data with respect to the Earth frame. We also calculate the sensor rotations between consecutive time samples and represent them by quaternions in the Earth frame. We incorporate our method in the pre-processing stage of the standard activity recognition scheme and provide a comparative evaluation with the existing methods based on seven state-of-the-art classifiers and a publicly available dataset. The standard system with fixed sensor unit orientations cannot handle incorrectly oriented sensors, resulting in an average accuracy reduction of 31.8%. Our method results in an accuracy drop of only 4.7% on average compared to the standard system, outperforming the existing approaches that cause an accuracy degradation between 8.4 and 18.8%. We also consider stationary and non-stationary activities separately and evaluate the performance of each method for these two groups of activities. All of the methods perform significantly better in distinguishing non-stationary activities, our method resulting in an accuracy drop of 2.1% in this case. Our method clearly surpasses the remaining methods in classifying stationary activities where some of the methods noticeably fail. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of wearable systems to make them robust against variable sensor unit orientations by transforming the sensor data at the pre-processing stage. © 2018 by the authors.

From the early Li-metal anode iterations to the current commercial Li-ion batteries (LIBs), the story of the Li-based battery is full of breakthroughs and back tracing steps. This review will discuss the main roles of material science in the development of LIBs. As LIB research progresses and the materials of interest change, different emphases on the different subdisciplines of material science are placed. Early works on LIBs focus more on solid state physics whereas near the end of the 20th century, researchers began to focus more on the morphological aspects (surface coating, porosity, size, and shape) of electrode materials. While it is easy to point out which specific cathode and anode materials are currently good candidates for the next-generation of batteries, it is difficult to explain exactly why those are chosen. In this review, for the reader a complete developmental story of LIB should be clearly drawn, along with an explanation of the reasons responsible for the various technological shifts. The review will end with a statement of caution for the current modern battery research along with a brief discussion on beyond lithium-ion battery chemistries. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here we report the development of a mechanism and the first model simulations, which can explain the formation of this MLT N 2 O layer. N 2 O production occurs primarily via a reaction route involving the excitation of N 2 from secondary electrons. Simulations using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, with external forcing from the Global Airglow model, quantitatively reproduce the observed vertical, latitudinal, and seasonal N 2 O variations. Sensitivity results indicate that photoelectrons are far more important than previously predicted, causing approximately two thirds of global N 2 O production in the MLT. Energetic electron precipitation over high latitudes provides the remaining contribution. Solar cycle analysis reveals N 2 O enhancements of up to ×2 at solar maximum compared to solar minimum. ©2018.

The government of Vietnam has prioritized enhancing depression care through primary healthcare (PHC) and efforts are currently underway to test and scale-up psychosocial interventions throughout the country. With these initiatives in progress, it is important to understand implementation factors that might influence the successful integration of depression services into PHC. As the implementers of these new interventions, primary care providers (PHPs) are well placed to provide important insight into implementation factors affecting the integration of depression services into PHC. This mixed-methods study examines factors at the individual, organizational and structural levels that may act as barriers and facilitators to the integration of depression services into PHC in Vietnam from the perspective of PHPs. Methods: Data collection took place in Hanoi, Vietnam in 2014. We conducted semi-structured interviews with PHPs (n = 30) at commune health centres and outpatient clinics in one rural and one urban district of Hanoi. Theoretical thematic analysis was used to analyse interview data. We administered an online survey to PHPs at n = 150 randomly selected communes across Hanoi. N = 226 PHPs responded to the survey. We used descriptive statistics to describe the study variables acting as barriers and facilitators and used a chi-square test of independence to indicate statistically significant (p <.05) associations between study variables and the profession, location and gender of PHPs. Results: Individual-level barriers include low level of knowledge and familiarity with depression among PHPs. Organizational barriers include low resource availability in PHC and low managerial discretion. Barriers at the structural level include limited mental health training among all PHPs and the existing programmatic structure of PHC in Vietnam, which sets mental health apart from general services. Facilitators at the individual level include positive attitudes among PHPs towards people with depression and interest in undergoing enhanced training in depression service delivery. Conclusions: While facilitating factors at the individual level are encouraging, considerable barriers at the structural level must be addressed to ensure the successful integration of depression services into PHC in Vietnam. © 2018 The Author(s).",Depression; Global mental health; Implementation; Mixed methods; Primary care; Vietnam,"depression; female; human; integrated health care system; interview; male; organization and management; outpatient department; primary health care; qualitative research; questionnaire; rural population; urban population; Viet Nam; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Depressive Disorder; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population; Vietnam",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14726963,,,30115050,English,BMC Health Serv.

A systematic approach to selecting study areas can help ensure that an adequate range of the variables of interest is captured. We present a novel method of selecting study sites representing a larger region, in which the region is divided into subregions, which are characterized with relevant independent variables, and displayed in mathematical variable space. Potential study sites are also displayed this way, and selected to cover the range in variables present in the region. The coverage of sites is assessed with the Quality Index, which compares the range and standard deviation of variables among the sites to that of the larger region, and prioritizes sites that are well-distributed (i.e. not clumped) in variable space. We illustrate the method with a case study examining relationships between agricultural land use, physiography and stream phosphorus (P) export, in which we selected several variables representing agricultural P inputs and landscape susceptibility to P loss. A geographic area of 110,000 km2 was represented with 11 study sites with good coverage of four variables representing agricultural P inputs and transport mechanisms taken from commonly-available geospatial datasets. We use a genetic algorithm to select 11 sites with the highest possible QI and compare these, post-hoc, to our sites. This approach reduces subjectivity in site selection, considers practical constraints and easily allows for site reselection if necessary. This site selection approach can easily be adapted to different landscapes and study goals, as we provide an algorithm and computer code to reproduce our approach elsewhere. © 2018",Field studies; Optimization; Site selection; Study design,Agricultural runoff; Agriculture; Genetic algorithms; Land use; Optimization; Agricultural land use; Environmental studies; Field studies; Independent variables; Several variables; Standard deviation; Study design; Transport mechanism; Site selection; phosphorus; computer simulation; data set; genetic algorithm; numerical model; optimization; phosphorus; qualitative analysis; site selection; spatial data; agricultural land; Article; biogeographic region; case study; environmental parameters; genetic algorithm; land use; priority journal; Quality Index,,Elsevier B.V.,489697,,STEVA,,English,Sci.

A review of systematic reviews was conducted to identify gaps in the evidence on such interventions. Medline, EMBASE CINAHL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched to identify systematic reviews published in English from January 2005 to May 2017 and considering research on interventions to reduce sugar intake. Twelve systematic reviews that considered price changes, interventions to alter the food available within specific environments, and health promotion and education programs were examined. Each of the identified reviews focused on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). The existing literature provides some promising indications in terms of the potential of interventions to reduce SSB consumption among populations. However, a common thread is the limited scope of available evidence, combined with the heterogeneity of methods and measures used in existing studies, which limits conclusions that can be reached regarding the effectiveness of interventions. Reviewed studies typically had limited follow-up periods, making it difficult to assess the sustainability of effects. Further, there is a lack of studies that address the complex context within which interventions are implemented and evaluated, and little is known about the cost-effectiveness of interventions. Identified gaps speak to the need for a more holistic approach to sources of sugars beyond SSBs, consensus on measures and methods, attention to the implementation of interventions in relation to context, and careful monitoring to identify intended and unintended consequences. © 2018 by the authors.

Older adults with chronic conditions receive care from multiple providers, across multiple settings, and this care is often unorganized and confusing. In 2005, Ontario established a model of inter-professional primary care (family health teams) with the aim of providing enhanced interdisciplinary primary care to patients. Primary care requires an in-depth understanding of the operations of primary care teams and their relationships with other community services. The aim of this study was to develop a deeper understanding of the current operations of two family health teams in Ontario, including their current processes for referrals, information sharing, and engagement of patients in decision-making. Methods: Focus group and individual semi-structured interviews with health care providers were conducted. Purposeful sampling was used to ensure information was obtained from different professional perspectives. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Using NVivo 10, data were analyzed using line by line thematic analysis techniques. A cluster technique was then applied to group similar codes into themes. Results: Three focus group interviews (involving 4-6 health care providers/focus group) and six individual interviews were conducted with health care providers from two primary care teams and surrounding community care organizations. Six key themes were identified: 1) challenges engaging older adults in decisions about their care; 2) who is responsible for coordinating the care? 3) fragmented information sharing between health care providers; 4) lack of standardized referral processes and follow-up; 5) identifying services in the community for older adults; and 6) caring for older adults in rural communities. Conclusions: The results of this study provide an in-depth understanding of the current context in which the primary care teams are currently operating. Improved primary care will require stronger processes of coordination, greater knowledge of and connections with other community services, and enhanced patient engagement processes. This information provides a helpful basis for implementing interventions in primary care. © 2018 The Author(s).",Care coordination; Health care providers; Older adults; Primary care; Qualitative methods,aged; article; community care; coordination; family health; follow up; genetic transcription; health care personnel; human; Ontario; organization; patient referral; primary medical care; qualitative analysis; rural population; sampling; semi structured interview; thematic analysis,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712296,,,30086707,English,BMC Fam.

The key objective is to utilize warm forming to form aggressive geometries and control the springback to improve the part flatness which enables the use of harder temper material with improved strength. Simulations and experiments are performed considering heated dies at several different temperatures up to 350 °C and the blanks are pre-heated in the dies. The geometry under study is referred as a surrogate heat-exchanger component (SHC) and contains complex features found on commercial automotive thermal management systems. An in-depth springback characterization was completed for a wide range of forming process parameters such as: temperature, punch load, sheet direction, and holding time. Numerical simulations were also performed to predict the springback behavior and were compared to the experiments. There were no clear results showing improvement in formability using the warm forming process. However, increased temperatures (above 250 °C) offered significant improvement in springback for the harder H24 material temper. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Although crystal plasticity can provide an accurate description of local deformation behaviour, it is often computationally expensive and usually replaced by flow rule-based phenomenological models that do not capture this phenomenon. This work presents a phenomenological-based texture evolution (PBTE) model that allows for the enhancement of flow rule-based models to capture microstructural spin in a phenomenological manner. A numerical framework is presented for generating and calibrating the microstructural evolution for the PBTE model using crystal plasticity. The PBTE Model is calibrated and employed to predict the macroscopic mechanical response and the generated microstructural spin for single crystal FCC cube during non-proportional strain paths. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

To navigate change, decision-makers can adopt culturally-sensitive interventions to address the needs of diverse stakeholders and rights holders. Calls for Indigenous flows have become important as dam operators seek to renew their legal and social licenses to operate. Knowledge pluralism is needed to enhance decision-making about flows that better address complexity and change to Indigenous livelihoods and cultural practices. However, leveraging diverse knowledge types to inform these interventions is not simply a matter of changing management practice. Power relations can constrain knowledge pluralism. We contribute an empirical example that links power in a decision-making process about a dam in Saskatchewan, Canada, to the losses experienced by downstream Indigenous communities.

The relatively low conductivity of most solid electrolytes and the often sluggish charge transfer kinetics at the interface between solid electrolyte and electrode layers are considered to be amongst the major challenges facing ASSBs. This review presents an overview of the state of the art in solid lithium and sodium ion conductors, with an emphasis on inorganic materials. The correlations between the composition, structure and conductivity of these solid electrolytes are illustrated and strategies to boost ion conductivity are proposed. In particular, the high grain boundary resistance of solid oxide electrolytes is identified as a challenge. Critical issues of solid electrolytes beyond ion conductivity are also discussed with respect to their potential problems for practical applications. The chemical and electrochemical stabilities of solid electrolytes are discussed, as are chemo-mechanical effects which have been overlooked to some extent. Furthermore, strategies to improve the practical performance of ASSBs, including optimizing the interface between solid electrolytes and electrode materials to improve stability and lower charge transfer resistance are also suggested. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Charge transfer; Electrodes; Grain boundaries; Metal ions; Potentiometric sensors; Solid state devices; All-solid state batteries; Charge transfer kinetics; Charge transfer resistance; Chemical and electrochemical stability; Grain boundary resistance; High energy densities; Sodium ion conductors; Solid oxide electrolytes; Solid electrolytes; electrochemical method; electrode; electrolyte; energy storage; grain boundary; instrumentation; ion; optimization; performance assessment,,Royal Society of Chemistry,17545692,,,,English,Energy Environ.

The school environment represents an important domain for advancing health policy among youth populations. This study examines the impact of school-based e-cigarette control policies on student e-cigarette use in the context of a natural experiment. METHODS Using three years of longitudinal student and school level data (2013/2014 to 2015/2016), from a sample of 69 secondary schools in Ontario, Canada, a generalized estimating equation approach examined the impact of school-based e-cigarette control policy changes on the prevalence of youth e-cigarette use. The main outcome of interest was current e-cigarette use, while covariates included age, gender, ethnicity, and amount of spending money in dollars per week the student has. Tests of proportion (t-tests) were used to examine whether there were any significant differences in the changes for each intervention school relative to the sample of schools that report no changes in school-level e-cigarette control policies. RESULTS Estimates from the generalized estimating equation approach suggest that students had lower odds of using e-cigarettes in schools where an e-cigarette control policy was implemented. That is, the e-cigarette control policy decreased the adjusted odds of being an e-cigarette user (OR=0.68; 95% CI: 0.480.97). Examining school-specific impact, at four of six schools that had an e-cigarette control policy, the ban on the use of e-cigarettes may have lowered the prevalence of e-cigarette use. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to use longitudinal data to study school-level e-cigarette use and the impact of e-cigarette control policy. These results provide new evidence that school-level policies banning the use of e-cigarettes on school property may be effective in reducing e-cigarette use (or preventing it) in their current form, as seen in this natural experiment. © 2018 Milicic S.",Electronic cigarettes; Interventional evaluation; Natural experiment; School-based policies and programs; Youth,article; controlled study; ethnicity; female; gender; high school; human; juvenile; male; money; Ontario; prevalence; student; vaping,,International Society for the Prevention of Tobacco Induced Diseases,16179625,,,,English,Tob.

We quantify the changes in the global agricultural land footprint if the world were to adhere to the dietary guidelines put forth by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), while accounting for the land use change incurred by import/export required to meet those guidelines. We analyze data at country, continental, and global levels. USDA guidelines are viewed as an improvement on the current land-intensive diet of the average American, but despite this our results show that global adherence to the guidelines would require 1 gigahectare of additional landroughly the size of Canadaunder current agricultural practice. The results also show a strong divide between Eastern and Western hemispheres, with many Western hemisphere countries showing net land sparing under a USDA guideline diet, while many Eastern hemisphere countries show net land use increase under a USDA guideline diet. We conclude that national dietary guidelines should be developed using not just health but also global land use and equity as criteria. Because global lands are a limited resource, national dietary guidelines also need to be coordinated internationally, in much the same way greenhouse gas emissions are increasingly coordinated. © 2018 Rizvi et al.

However, there has been limited research assessing the accuracy of such reports captured using novel dietary assessment tools. The purpose of the current study was to assess the validity of the web-based Automated Self-Administered 24-h Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24-Canada) for capturing dietary intake among children aged two-five years (n = 40), using parental proxy reporting. The study was conducted in a daycare setting, allowing for standardization of foods and drinks offered and direct observation of intake. Parental-reported intake was compared to true intake for lunch and dinner, as well as an afternoon snack, on a single day. Each eating occasion, including plate waste, was unobtrusively documented. Parents were not present for lunch or the afternoon snack, but joined their children at the daycare centre for the dinner meal. The following day, parents reported their childrens intake from the previous 24-h period using ASA24-Canada. For the eating occasions assessed, parents reported exact or close matches for 79.2% (82.3% for lunch, 81.2% for the snack, and 77.4% for dinner) of the foods and beverages truly consumed by children. Estimates of intake for energy and macronutrients examined (carbohydrates, fat, and protein) based on parental reports were higher than those based on true (observed) intake. Our findings suggest that parents are able to report what their preschool children eat and drink relatively accurately. However, the accuracy of portion size estimates is low. Strategies to enhance portion size reporting are needed to improve parental proxy reporting. © 2018 by the authors.

DISB is being developed within the EU Horizon 2020 project BIOMOre which targets a calcareous sedimentary copper ore, kupferschiefer, which is a widespread subterranean rock stratum in central and north-western Europe. Laboratory tests on the two main copper-bearing fractions of kupferschiefer, sandstone and black shale, showed that, besides requiring basic minerals to be removed ahead of indirect bioleaching (to avoid the formation of ferric carbonates), both contained significant amounts of chloride minerals (chiefly halite) which could have a major negative impact on DISB. A sequential three-phased protocol was developed, involving (i) leaching with water, which removed most of the chloride, (ii) leaching with sulfuric acid, which removed most of the residual chloride and carbonate minerals, and (iii) indirect bioleaching with an acidic ferric iron lixiviant. The latter was produced in a laboratory-scale ferric iron-generating bioreactor dominated by the iron-oxidizing acidophilic prokaryotes Leptospirillum ferriphilum, Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans and Ferroplasma acidophilum. The iron oxidizing capacity of this bioreactor was not impaired by the concentrations of chloride present during the leaching phase in which it was used. Sequential leaching was applied successfully using a composite (sandstone plus black shale) ore column, which mimicked the flow circuit in a DISB, and included a bleed stream where soluble copper was removed from the pregnant leach solutions generated by sulfide precipitation. Water leaching was shown to cause partial disintegration and lowering of the resistance of the sandstone fraction to crushing. © 2018 The Authors",Acid leaching; Bioreactor; Copper ore; Indirect bioleaching; Kupferschiefer; Salt,Bioconversion; Bioleaching; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Chloride minerals; Copper deposits; Copper ore treatment; Environmental impact; Iron; Oil shale; Ores; Salts; Sandstone; Shale; Sodium chloride; Sulfur compounds; Acid leaching; Copper ore; Copper sulfide ores; Kupferschiefer; Leptospirillum ferriphilum; Pregnant leach solutions; Sulfide precipitation; Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans; Copper compounds,,Elsevier B.V.,0304386X,,HYDRD,,English,Hydrometallurgy,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047791108,

This study aimed to evaluate the relative validity of a new online Beverage Frequency Questionnaire (BFQ) among young adults in Canada. Methods: A cross-sectional relative validation study was conducted among young adults aged 16-30 years (n = 50). Participants completed a 17-item BFQ, a 7-day food record (7dFR), and a single-item measure of sugary drink intake. Pearson correlations and paired t-tests were used to evaluate correlation and agreement between the measures for 17 individual beverage categories, total drink consumption, total alcoholic beverage consumption, and two definitions of drinks with excess sugars. Cognitive interviews were conducted to examine participant interpretation and comprehensiveness of the BFQ. Results: Estimates of beverage intake based on the BFQ and the 7dFR were highly correlated, specifically for the total number and volume of beverages consumed, total alcoholic beverage consumption, sugary drink intake, and each of the 17 beverage categories with 3 exceptions: coffee or tea with sugar or cream, specialty coffees, and hard alcohol with caloric mix. Paired t-tests between the BFQ and the 7dFR indicated that the average reported volume was significantly different only for sweetened fruit drinks. The single-item measure of sugary beverage intake was not significantly correlated with the 7dFR. Cognitive interviewing demonstrated high comprehension levels, and confirmed the appropriateness of the BFQ beverage categories and sizes. Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest that the BFQ performed well relative to a 7dFR and had high usability among this study population, indicating its promise for collecting population-level data on beverage intake, including sugar-sweetened beverages, which are known indicators of diet and health. © 2018 The Author(s).",Dietary assessment; Food frequency screener; Relative validity; Sugar sweetened beverages; Sugary drinks,alcohol; drinking water; accuracy; adolescent; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; beer; Beverage Frequency Questionnaire; Canada; cider; coffee; cross-sectional study; energy drink; female; fruit juice; human; interview; male; milk; nutritional assessment; nutritional status; online system; questionnaire; sports drink; sugar-sweetened beverage; tea; validity; vegetable juice; wine; young adult,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14752891,,,30068342,English,Nutr.

The results showed that (1) individual differences in response variability during the vMRT are highly reliable; (2) prior to thought probes, response variability increases with increasing depth of mind wandering; (3) response variability is highly consistent between the vMRT and the original MRT; and (4) both response variability and depth of mind wandering increase with increasing time on task. Our results indicate that the original MRT findings are consistent across the visual and auditory modalities, and that the response variability measured in both tasks indexes a non-modality-specific tendency toward behavioral variability. The vMRT will be useful in the place of the MRT in experimental contexts in which researchers designs require a visual-based primary task. © 2018, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",Metronome Response Task; Mind wandering; MRT; Sustained Attention; vMRT,adult; article; attention; DNA probe; female; human; human experiment; male; scientist; stimulus; thinking; validation process; attention; individuality; physiology; reaction time; task performance; validation study; young adult; Adult; Attention; Female; Humans; Individuality; Male; Reaction Time; Task Performance and Analysis; Thinking; Young Adult,,Springer New York LLC,1554351X,,,29435913,English,Behav.

Low-load resistance exercise (LLRE) counters inactivity-induced muscle atrophy in older adults, but changes in muscle fibre morphology are unstudied. We aimed to determine the impact of LLRE during short-term inactivity (step-reduction) on muscle fibre size and capillarity as well as satellite cell (SC) content in older skeletal muscle. Methods: Fourteen older (~71 years) male adults underwent 14 days of step reduction (&lt;1500 steps/day) while performing six sessions of LLRE (~30% maximal strength) with one leg (SR + EX) while the contralateral leg served as an untrained control (SR). Seven healthy ambulatory age-matched male adults (~69 years) served as a comparator group (COM). Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis after 14 days, and immunohistochemical analysis was performed to determine muscle fibre cross-sectional area (CSA), myonuclear content, SC content (PAX7+ cells), and total (C:F) and fibre type-specific (C:Fi) capillary-to-fibre ratios. Results: Type I and II fibre CSA was greater in SR + EX compared with SR. Whereas there were no differences across fibre types between SR + EX and CON, type II fibre CSA was significantly lower in SR compared with COM. Type II myonuclear domain was greater in SR + EX compared with COM and SR. Pax7+ cells associated with type I and II fibres were lower in SR compared with SR + EX. Type II PAX7+ cells were also lower in SR compared with COM with a similar trend for type I fibres. There were trends for a lower C:Fi in SR compared with SR + EX for both fibre types with no differences for each compared with COM. Conclusions: Minimal LLRE during a period of decreased physical activity is associated with greater muscle fibre CSA, SC content, and capillarization. These results support the use of LLRE as an effective countermeasure to inactivity-induced alterations in muscle morphology with age. © 2018 The Authors.

The goal of this expedition was to complete the discovery of a northwest passage by navigating the uncharted area between Barrow Strait and Simpson Strait. Franklin and his crew spent the first winter at Beechey Island, where three crewmen died and were buried. In September 1846, the ships became stranded in ice off the northwest coast of King William Island, where they remained until April 1848. At that time, the crew, reduced to 105, deserted the ships and retreated south along the islands western and southern shores in a desperate attempt to reach the mainland and via the Back River, to obtain aid at a Hudsons Bay Company Post. Sadly, not one individual survived. Previous analyses of bone, hair, and soft tissue samples from expedition remains found that crewmembers tissues contained elevated lead (Pb) levels, suggesting that Pb poisoning may have contributed to their demise; however, questions remain regarding the timing and degree of exposure and, ultimately, the extent to which the crewmembers may have been impacted. To address this historical question, we investigated three hypotheses. First, if elevated Pb exposure was experienced by the crew during the expedition, we hypothesized that those sailors who survived longer (King William Island vs. Beechey Island) would exhibit more extensive uptake of Pb in their bones and vice versa. Second, we hypothesized that Pb would be elevated in bone microstructural features forming at or near the time of death compared with older tissue. Finally, if Pb exposure played a significant role in the failure of the expedition we hypothesized that bone samples would exhibit evidence of higher and more sustained uptake of Pb than that of a contemporary comparator naval population from the 19 th century. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed bone and dental remains of crew members and compared them against samples derived from the Royal Navy cemetery in Antigua. Synchrotron-based high resolution confocal X-ray fluorescence imaging was employed to visualize Pb distribution within bone and tooth microstructures at the micro scale. The data did not support our first hypothesis as Pb distribution within the samples from the two different sites was similar. Evidence of Pb within skeletal microstructural features formed near the time of death lent support to our second hypothesis but consistent evidence of a marked elevation in Pb levels was lacking. Finally, the comparative analysis with the Antigua samples did not support the hypothesis that the Franklin sailors were exposed to an unusually high level of Pb for the time period. Taken all together our skeletal microstructural results do not support the conclusion that Pb played a pivotal role in the loss of Franklin and his crew. © 2018 Swanston et al.

This paper is drawn from a workshop held at the International Society of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2017 Annual Meeting, and highlights considerations and research priorities relevant to measuring dietary outcomes within intervention studies. Self-reported dietary data are typically relied upon in such studies, and it is recognized that these data are affected by random and systematic error. Additionally, differential error between intervention and comparison groups or pre- and post-intervention can be elicited by the intervention itself, for example, by creating greater awareness of eating or drinking occasions or the desire to appear compliant. Differential reporting can render the results of trials incorrect or inconclusive by leading to biased estimates and reduced statistical power. The development of strategies to address intervention-related biases requires developing a better understanding of the situations and population groups in which interventions are likely to elicit differential reporting and the extent of the bias. Also needed are efforts to expand the feasibility and applications of biomarkers to address intervention-related biases. In the meantime, researchers are encouraged to consider the potential for differential biases in dietary reporting in a given study, to choose tools carefully and take steps to minimize and/or measure factors such as social desirability biases that might contribute to differential reporting, and to consider the implications of differential reporting for study results. © 2018 by the authors.

However, the effectiveness of PES as an instrument to achieve these multiple objectives, in particular in a conservation-development context, is often questioned. This study adds to the very limited empirical evidence base and investigates to what extent Vietnams move to PES has helped protect forest ecosystems and improve local livelihoods and income inequality. We zoom in on Lam Dong province, where PES was first introduced in Vietnam in 2009. Changes in forest cover are analysed using satellite images over a period of 15 years (20002014). Socio-economic impacts are assessed based on rural household interviews with PES participants and non-participants as a control group over a period of 7 years (20082014). Our results show that PES contributes significantly to forest cover, the improvement of local livelihoods, and the reduction of income inequality. © 2018 Phan et al.

Vero cells were used as a model. The nanocomposite materials contained comb structures with equal-width trenches and lines. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy were used to image the alignment and elongation of cells. Cells were sensitive to the trench widths, and their observed behavior could be separated into three different regimes corresponding to different spreading mechanism. Cells on fine structures (trench widths of 0.21 to 0.5 ?m) formed bridges across trench openings. On larger trenches (from 1 to 10 ?m), cells formed a conformal layer matching the surface topographical features. When the trenches were larger than 10 ?m, the majority of cells spread like those on blanket tantalum films; however, a significant proportion adhered to the trench sidewalls or bottom corner junctions. Pseudopodia extending from the bulk of the cell were readily observed in this work and a minimum effective diameter of ~50 nm was determined for stable adhesion to a tantalum surface. This sized structure is consistent with the ability of pseudopodia to accommodate ~4-6 integrin molecules. © 2018 by the authors.",Adhesion; Mammalian cells; Morphology; Nanoscale; Pseudopodia; Tantalum,Adhesion; Cytology; Fluorescence microscopy; Mammals; Morphology; Nanocomposites; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicon compounds; Silicon oxides; Tantalum; Tantalum oxides; Corner junctions; Effective diameter; High-resolution scanning electron microscopies; Mammalian cells; Nano scale; Pseudopodia; Topographical features; Trench sidewalls; Cells,,MDPI AG,19961944,,,,English,Mater.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051127339,

Since the World Health Organisation recommends Civil Society Organisation's (CSO) involvement to support compliance with smoke-free laws, we explored CSOs' perceptions of law implementation in Kampala, Uganda, and the challenges and opportunities for achieving compliance. Since hospitality workers tend to have the greatest level of exposure to second-hand smoke, we focussed on implementation in respect to hospitality venues (bars/pubs and restaurants). Methods: In August 2016, three months after law implementation, we invited key Kampala-based CSOs to participate in face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Interviews probed participants' perceptions about law implementation, barriers impeding compliance, opportunities to enhance compliance, and the role of CSOs in supporting law implementation. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Qualitative content analysis was conducted using the interview transcripts. Results: Fourteen individuals, comprising mainly senior managers from CSOs, participated and reported poor compliance with the smoke-free law in hospitality venues. Respondents noted that contributing factors included low awareness of the law amongst the general public and hospitality staff, limited implementation activities due to scarce resources and lack of coordinated enforcement. Opportunities for improving compliance included capacity building for enforcement agency staff, routine monitoring, rigorous enactment of penalties, and education about the smoke-free law aimed at hospitality venue staff and the general public. Allegations of tobacco industry misinformation were said to have undermined compliance.

Conclusions: This study suggests that the process of smoke-free law implementation in Uganda has not aligned with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for implementing smoke-free laws, and highlights that low-income countries may need additional support to enable them to effectively plan for policy implementation and resist industry interference. © 2018 The Author(s).",Global health; Policy implementation; Qualitative; Second-hand smoke; Smoke-free; Tobacco control,adult; article; awareness; capacity building; catering service; clinical article; content analysis; education; female; genetic transcription; human; human experiment; low income country; male; manager; monitoring; passive smoking; perception; practice guideline; punishment; qualitative research; semi structured interview; smoking ban; staff; stakeholder engagement; tobacco industry; Uganda; worker; world health organization,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712458,,,,English,BMC Public Health,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050877933,

Evidence indicates that MI is an effective intervention for improving health behaviors as related to diet, exercise, and diabetes among adolescents. However, there is a lack of understanding about the mechanisms through which MI works and the contextual factors impacting MI effectiveness. The purpose of this review was to understand how, for whom, and under what circumstances MI works for adolescent health behavior change, which will inform future implementation of this intervention. To provide this in-depth understanding, a realist-informed systematic review was conducted in order to synthesize the evidence on the use of MI for health behaviors. Self-determination theory (SDT) was chosen as the candidate theory for testing in the present review. Methods: Databases including PsycINFO, Healthstar, Cochrane, and PubMed were searched for articles published until March 2017. The search strategy included studies that examined or reviewed the effectiveness or efficacy of MI to change health behaviors among adolescent populations. The search identified 185 abstracts, of which 28 were included in the review. The literature was synthesized qualitatively (immersion/crystallization) and tested SDT as the candidate theory. Results: Based on SDT, three mechanisms were found within reviewed studies, including competence, relatedness, and autonomy. The following contexts were found to impact mechanisms: school setting, clinician MI proficiency, parental involvement, and peer involvement. Conclusions: This realist-informed systematic review provides advances in understanding the mechanisms involved in MI for adolescent health behavior change. Additionally, it provides important practical information as to which contexts create the conditions for these mechanisms to occur, leading to health behavior change. The results can inform future MI interventions for adolescent health behavior change. Future research should continue to test this realist theory and also examine mechanism variables not extensively documented in order to improve our understanding of MI in this population. © 2018 The Author(s).",Adolescent; Health behaviors; Motivational interviewing; Realist review,adolescent; adolescent behavior; adolescent health; article; crystallization; drug efficacy; female; health behavior; human; immersion; male; Medline; motivational interviewing; PsycINFO; systematic review; theoretical study; diet; exercise; health promotion; motivational interviewing; procedures; psychology; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Adolescent Health; Diet; Exercise; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Humans; Motivational Interviewing,,BioMed Central Ltd.,20464053,,,30053903,English,Syst.

Understanding their sources is of great importance to developing appropriate river management strategies. In this study, we present an integrated sediment transport model composed of a catchment-scale hydrological model to predict river discharge, a river-hydraulics model to obtain shear stresses in the channel, a sediment-generating model, and a river sediment-transport model. We use this framework to investigate the sediment contributions from catchment and in-stream processes in the Ammer catchment close to Tübingen in southwestern Germany. The model is calibrated to stream flow and suspended-sediment concentrations. We use the monthly mean suspended-sediment load to analyze seasonal variations of different processes. The contributions of catchment and in-stream processes to the total loads are demonstrated by model simulations under different flow conditions. The evaluation of shear stresses by the river-hydraulics model allows the identification of hotspots and hot moments of bed erosion for the main stem of the Ammer River. The results suggest that the contributions of suspended-sediment loads from urban areas and in-stream processes are higher in the summer months, while deposition has small variations with a slight increase in summer months. The sediment input from agricultural land and urban areas as well as bed and bank erosion increase with an increase in flow rates. Bed and bank erosion are negligible when flow is smaller than the corresponding thresholds of 1.5 and 2.5 times the mean discharge, respectively. The bed-erosion rate is higher during the summer months and varies along the main stem. Over the simulated time period, net sediment trapping is observed in the Ammer River. The present work is the basis to study particle-facilitated transport of pollutants in the system, helping to understand the fate and transport of sediments and sediment-bound pollutants. © 2018 Author(s).",,Catchments; Erosion; Groundwater; Hydraulics; River pollution; Rivers; Runoff; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Shear stress; Stream flow; Water quality; Facilitated transport; Fate and transport; Hydrological modeling; Seasonal variation; Sediment transport model; Stream water quality; Suspended sediment concentrations; Suspended sediment loads; Suspended sediments; agricultural land; bank erosion; catchment; hydrological modeling; river discharge; river water; sediment transport; stream; suspended sediment; Ammer River; Bavaria; Germany,,Copernicus GmbH,10275606,,,,English,Hydrol.

Individuals prone to the experience of boredom demonstrate lower levels of self-control which may be at the heart of their failures to engage in goal-directed, meaningful behaviors. Here we develop the hypothesis that distinct self-regulatory profiles, which in turn differentially influence modes of goal pursuit, are at the heart of boredom proneness. Two specific regulatory modes are addressed: Locomotion, the desire to 'just do it,' an action oriented mode of goal-pursuit, and Assessment, the desire to 'do the right thing,' an evaluative orientation toward goal pursuit. We present data from a series of seven large samples of undergraduates showing that boredom proneness is negatively correlated with Locomotion, as though getting on with things acts as a prophylactic against boredom. This 'failure to launch' that we suggest is prevalent in the highly boredom prone individual, could be due to an inability to appropriately discriminate value (i.e., everything is tarred with the same gray brush), an unwillingness to put in the required effort to engage, or simply a failure to get started. In contrast, boredom proneness was consistently positively correlated with the Assessment mode of self-regulation. We suggest that this association reflects a kind of rumination that hampers satisfying goal pursuit. © 2018 Mugon, Struk and Danckert.",Assessment; Boredom; Goal-pursuit; Locomotion; Self-regulation,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,16641078,,,,English,Front.

For the former, we compute the dependence of the CFT complexity on a boundary temporal parameter and find it to be commensurate with corresponding computations carried out in terms of the rate of change of the bulk action on a Wheeler deWitt (WDW) patch. For the latter, we compare the action/complexity relation for (d+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild AdS black holes to those of their geon counterparts, obtained via topological identification in the bulk spacetime. The complexity/action duality relation holds in both cases, but with the proportionality changed by a factor of 4, indicating sensitivity to spacetime topology. © 2018 authors.

Quantifying the condition of the reinforcing steel can help manage the human and financial risks that arise from unexpected reinforced concrete structure functional failure. Also, a quantitative time history of reinforcing steel condition can be used to make decisions on rehabilitation, decommissioning, or replacement. The self-magnetic behavior of ferromagnetic materials is useful for quantitative condition assessment. In this study, a ferromagnetic rebar with artificial defects was scanned by a three-dimensional (3D) laser scanner. The obtained point cloud was imported as a real geometry to a finite element software platform; its self-magnetic behavior was then simulated under the influence of Earth's magnetic field. The various passive magnetic parameters that can be measured were reviewed for different conditions. Statistical studies showed that 0.76% of the simulation-obtained data of the rebar surface was related to the defect locations. Additionally, acceptable coincidences were confirmed between the magnetic properties from numerical simulation and from experimental outputs, most noticeably at hole locations. © 2018 by the authors.",Defect; Magnetic flux density; Passive Magnetic Inspection (PMI); Probability paper method; Rebar; Reinforce concrete; Self-magnetic behavior,,,MDPI AG,20763417,,,,English,Appl.

The fiber laser can be tuned and switched from single-wavelength to dual-wavelength oscillation by using our recently proposed tunable comb filter. The comb filter consists of a section of multimode fiber (MMF) coiled into a polarization controller and two sections of single mode fibers (SMFs) to form a SMF/MMF/SMF structure, serving as a simple tunable all-fiber Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Due to the insertion of the MMF-based polarization controller (PC), an additional phase shift is introduced from the difference of the birefringence intensity in different dominant modes, which can be used to tune the fiber laser. In the experiment, by properly adjusting the PC, a tuning range of 9.3 nm can be achieved for the single-wavelength operation. Moreover, dual-wavelength operation with different free-spectral-ranges can be obtained.

We conducted a scoping review to characterize the state of the evidence on food insecurity and mental health among women in high-income countries. The research databases PubMed, EMBASE, and psycINFO were searched using keywords capturing food insecurity, mental health, and women. Thirty-nine articles (representing 31 unique studies/surveys) were identified. Three-quarters of the articles drew upon data from a version of the United States Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Survey Module. A range of mental health measures were used, most commonly to measure depression and depressive symptoms, but also anxiety and stress. Most research was cross-sectional and showed associations between depression and food insecurity; longitudinal analyses suggested bidirectional relationships (with food insecurity increasing the risk of depressive symptoms or diagnosis, or depression predicting food insecurity). Several articles focused on vulnerable subgroups, such as pregnant women and mothers, women at risk of homelessness, refugees, and those who had been exposed to violence or substance abuse. Overall, this review supports a link between food insecurity and mental health (and other factors, such as housing circumstances and exposure to violence) among women in high-income countries and underscores the need for comprehensive policies and programs that recognize complex links among public health challenges. © 2018 by the authors.

It has been suggested that PHWs would be more salient if placed on the waterpipe device itself. This qualitative study explored how participants perceived the effects placing PHWs on waterpipe devices would have on warning salience and uptake or quitting of WTS. Methods: We conducted 10 focus groups and 10 in-depth interviews with 90 adult waterpipe smokers and non-smokers, men and women, who lived in rural, semi-urban and urban regions of Egypt. We presented participants with four novel PHWs of different sizes positioned randomly at four locations on a waterpipe device (the glass body, metal holder, mouthpiece or hose), one at a time. At each session, participants viewed a PHW on all four locations. Novel warnings were shown on plain labels with a dark uniform background and featured pictures, text and the quitline number. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants thought placing PHWs on waterpipe devices might increase salience, prevent WTS initiation or trigger quit attempts; they favoured placing PHWs on the glass body, mouthpiece or waterpipe hose. Both waterpipe smoker and non-smoker participants thought these potential effects would affect non-smokers or non-established smokers more than established waterpipe users. Conclusions: Our exploratory study suggests that PHWs featured prominently on waterpipe devices could potentially deter experimentation with waterpipe tobacco products and promote cessation, especially among non-established users. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

The forward problem is considered that when capturing objects using a camera, light reflected off of objects at different depths will result in blurry observations in the acquired image, whereas the inverse problem seeks to estimate the depth from the knowledge of the blurry observations. In the proposed approach, a colored quasi-random point projection pattern is projected onto the scene of interest, and each projection point in the image captured by a cellphone camera is analyzed using an inverse model to estimate the depth at that point. The proposed method has a relatively simple setup, consisting of a camera and a projector, and enables depth inference from a single capture. We conclude with qualitative and quantitative results that highlight the strong potential for enabling active depth sensing in a simple, efficient manner. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Cameras; Differential equations; Image processing; Cell phone camera; Depth from defocus; Depth measurements; Inverse modeling; Inverse modelling; Novel methodology; Point projection; Quantitative result; Inverse problems,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17426588,,,,English,J.

As such, it is now possible to design and build objects or devices with complex internal structures that conform to irregular external envelopes. In applications where fluid distribution or storage is an integral part of a larger system, additive manufacturing technologies allow ""left over space"" in an overall device volume to now be effectively utilized. Herein we describe a general algorithmic framework for the construction of branched networks of tubes which occupy a specified, and possibly quite complicated, region D ? 3 as fully as possible. Such networks can be important in a variety of industrial applications ranging from heat exchangers to storage vessels to fluid distribution networks. Depending on the specific application of interest, such a design problem can be extremely ill-posed: For a given region D, our algorithm can produce an enormous number of networks, which generally requires that a much smaller number of ""best"" networks be isolated by ranking the networks based upon some problem-dependent properties (e.g., heat transfer rate, minimal friction losses, volume fraction, etc.). Some simple examples are presented to illustrate the algorithm and its output with comments added to illustrate its potential utility in industrial applications. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,3D printers; Differential equations; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Additive manufacturing technology; Algorithmic framework; Design constraints; Fluid distribution; Heat transfer rate; Internal structure; Potential utility; Traditional constructions; Inverse problems,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17426588,,,,English,J.

We aimed to determine associations between mental illness, demographic, psychosocial and economic factors with experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) among pregnant women in a low resource setting in Cape Town and to explore the contextual elements pertaining to domestic violence. Methods: We recruited adult women attending antenatal services at a primary-level maternity facility. Demographic, socioeconomic and psychosocial data were collected by questionnaire. The Expanded Mini- International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Version 5.0.0 was used to assess mental health status and the Revised Conflict Tactic Scale (CTS2) used to assess IPV in the six months prior to the study. Non-parametric tests, Wilcoxon sum of rank test, Fisher Exact and two sample T test and multicollinearity tests were performed. Descriptive, bivariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify associations between the outcome of interest and key predictors. A probability value of p ? 0.05 was selected. From counselling case notes, a thematic content analysis was conducted to describe contextual factors pertaining to forms of domestic violence (DV). Results: The prevalence of IPV was 15% of a sample of 376 women. Women who were food insecure, unemployed, in stable but unmarried relationships, had experienced any form of past abuse and were not pleased about the current pregnancy were more likely to experience IPV. MINI-defined mental health problems and a history of mental illness were significantly associated with IPV. Qualitative analysis of 95 counselling case notes revealed that DV within the household was not limited to intimate partners and, DV in this context was often perceived as 'normal' behaviour by the participants. Conclusions: This study contributes towards a greater understanding of the risk profile for IPV amongst pregnant women in low-income settings. Adversity, including food insecurity and mental ill-health are closely associated with IPV during the antenatal period. Advocates against violence against pregnant women are advised to consider that violence in the home may be perpetrated by non-intimate partners and may by enabled by a pervasive belief in the acceptability of the violence. © 2018 The Author(s).",Abuse; Antenatal; Domestic violence; Food insecurity; Intimate partner violence; Low-income setting; Mental disorders; Mixed methods; Pregnancy; South Africa,adult; Article; behavior assessment; child abuse; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; disease association; domestic violence; economic aspect; female; food insecurity; household; human; low income country; major clinical study; maternity ward; mental disease; mental health; mini international neuropsychiatric interview; partner violence; pregnant woman; prenatal care; prevalence; primary medical care; retrospective study; risk factor; single woman; social psychology; South Africa; thematic analysis; unemployment; unwanted pregnancy; domestic violence; epidemiology; human relation; partner violence; poverty; pregnancy; pregnant woman; psychological rating scale; psychology; questionnaire; sexuality; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Domestic Violence; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Intimate Partner Violence; Mental Health; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Prevalence; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Sexual Partners; South Africa; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14726874,,BWHMA,29973182,English,BMC Women's Health,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049523570,

Indeed, over 70% of the articles on this topic have been published in the past five years. Through the application of a stakeholder lens, this paper explores how CSR has developed within the extant literature, paying particular attention to current gaps and highlighting the contributions of the research in this special issue. This emerging research on CSR in the context of tourism and hospitality is pushing past the boundaries of early approaches to corporate sustainability by providing empirical evidence to support the importance of integrating a range of stakeholder perspectives and needs throughout the planning, implementation, and evaluation of CSR initiatives. We observe that while there is ample research on certain stakeholder groups such as management, employees, shareholders, and consumers, there is less emphasis on the role of communities and ecosystems as stakeholders and very little related to suppliers, NGOs, and government. Although tourism and hospitality firms may not be subject to the same pressures as other industries, there remain important opportunities to both document and engage these external stakeholders in the journey towards sustainability. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",accountability; corporate social responsibility; hospitality; stakeholders; sustainability; Tourism,,,Routledge,9669582,,,,English,J.

Methods: A research-grade 1060-nm OCT system with 3.5-lm axial resolution in retinal tissue and 92,000 A scan/s image acquisition rate was used in this study. DOCT and OCTA measurements were acquired both from a flow phantom and in vivo from retinal blood vessels in six male Brown Norway rats. The total retinal blood flow (TRBF) was modified from baseline to 70% and 20% of baseline by reducing the ocular perfusion pressure (OPP). The retinal blood vessel caliber (RBVC) was measured from OCTA and DOCT images. The caliber measurements were conducted by two separate graders using a custom MATLAB-based image processing algorithm. Results: The RBVC measured with OCTA and DOCT for normal blood flow rates were not significantly different (56.69 ± 12.17 and 57.17 ± 9.46 lm, P = 0.27, respectively). However, significant differences were detected when TRBF was reduced to 70% (55.69 ± 11.56 vs. 50.62 ± 8.85 lm, P < 0.01) and 20% (50.29 ± 9.29 vs. 44.88 ± 7.13 lm, P < 0.01) of baseline. Conclusions: Reduced TRBF resulted in inaccuracy of the RBVC measurements with DOCT in both the phantom and animal study. This result suggests that OCTA is a more accurate tool for RBVC evaluation when applied to retinal diseases associated with reduced TRBF, such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Translational Relevance: Results from this study are directly applicable to clinical studies of retinal blood flow measured with OCTA and DOCT. © 2018 The Authors.",Doppler optical coherence tomography; Ocular perfusion pressure; Optical coherence tomography angiography; Retinal imaging,animal experiment; Article; blood vessel diameter; comparative study; controlled study; doppler optical coherence tomography; image analysis; image processing; in vivo study; intraocular pressure; male; nonhuman; oculoplethysmography; optical coherence tomography angiography; rat; retina blood vessel,,Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.,21642591,,,,English,Translational Vis.

Methods: A retrospective chart review of all children identified with reading problems and seen by the University of Waterloo, Optometry Clinic, from September 2012 to June 2013. Results: Files of 121 children (mean age 8.6 years, range 614 years) were reviewed. No significant refractive error was found in 81% of children. Five and 8 children were identified as strabismic at distance and near respectively. Phoria test revealed 90% and 65% of patients had normal distance and near phoria. Near point of convergencia (NPC) was <5 cm in 68% of children, and 77% had stereoacuity of ?40 seconds of arc. More than 50% of the children had normal fusional vergence ranges except for near positive fusional vergencce (base out) break (46%). Tests for accommodation showed 91% of children were normal for binocular facility, and approximately 70% of children had an expected accuracy of accommodation. Conclusion: Findings indicate that some children with an identified reading problem also present with abnormal binocular test results compared to published normal values. Further investigation should be performed to investigate the relationship between binocular vision function and reading performance. © 2017",Binocular vision; Pediatrics; Reading difficulty; Vision and learning,"accommodation; adolescent; alexia; binocular convergence; binocular vision; child; female; human; male; Ontario; pathophysiology; physiology; prevalence; reading; refraction error; retrospective study; visual acuity; visual disorder; Accommodation, Ocular; Adolescent; Child; Convergence, Ocular; Dyslexia, Acquired; Female; Humans; Male; Ontario; Prevalence; Reading; Refractive Errors; Retrospective Studies; Vision Disorders; Vision, Binocular; Visual Acuity",,Spanish Council of Optometry,18884296,,,29174394,English; Spanish,J.

For the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), floods from the Peace and Athabasca rivers are critical for sustaining abundant shallow water habitat, but their frequency has been in decline for decades over much of its area. Here, we assess current hydrological and limnological status in the PAD by integrating spatial and temporal data. Analysis of water isotope compositions and water chemistry measured at numerous lakes across the delta shows that hydro-limnological effects of the large-scale ice-jam flood event of 2014 failed to persist beyond the early ice-free season of 2015. Isotope-inferred paleohydrological records from five hydrologically representative lakes in the PAD indicate that periodic desiccation during the Little Ice Age occurred at the most elevated basin in response to locally arid climatic conditions, yet other lower elevation sites were influenced by high water level on Lake Athabasca owing to increased snowmelt- and glacier-derived river discharge. In contrast, water isotope data during the past 15 yr at all five lakes consistently document the strong role of evaporation, a trend which began in the early to mid-20 th century according to sediment records and is indicative of widespread aridity unprecedented during the past 400 yr. We suggest that integration of hydrological and limnological approaches over space and time is needed to inform assessment of contemporary lake conditions in large, complex floodplain landscapes. © 2018 The Authors Limnology and Oceanography published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",,aridity; climate conditions; desiccation; flood; flooding; floodplain; habitat type; isotopic composition; limnology; Little Ice Age; paleohydrology; river discharge; shallow water; snowmelt; water chemistry; water level; Alberta; Canada; Peace-Athabasca Delta,,Wiley Blackwell,19395590,,LIOCA,,English,Limnol.

We first review the current status for the renormalization group equations of gauge-fermion theories and extend the results to semisimple groups. In this regime these theories develop an interacting ultraviolet fixed point that for the semisimple case leads to a rich phase diagram. The latter contains a complete asymptotically safe fixed point repulsive in all couplings. We then add two gauged Weyl fermions belonging to arbitrary representations of the semisimple gauge group and a complex, gauged scalar to the original gauge-fermion theory allowing for new Yukawa interactions and quartic scalar self-coupling. Consequently, we determine the first nontrivial order in 1/Nf for the Yukawa and quartic beta functions. Our work elucidates, consolidates, and extends results obtained earlier in the literature. We also acquire relevant knowledge about the dynamics of gauge-Yukawa theories beyond perturbation theory. Our findings are applicable to any extension of the standard model featuring a large number of fermions such as asymptotic safety. © 2018 authors.

The powder metallurgy process facilitates the use of admixed ceramic particles to produce aluminum metal matrix composites. However, fundamental data on the thermal-mechanical response of commercially relevant powder metallurgy alloy systems under varying conditions of temperature and strain rate are lacking. To address this constraint, the current study investigates the thermal-mechanical processing response of a family of metal matrix composite materials that employ a commercially exploited base alloy system coupled with admixed additions of aluminum nitride. Industrially-sintered compacts were tested under hot compression using a Gleeble 3500 thermal-mechanical test system to quantify their flow behavior. The nominal workability was assessed as a function of material formulation, sintered preform condition, and processing parameters (temperature and strain rate). Optical metallography and electron backscatter diffraction were used to observe the grain evolution through deformation. Full densification was achieved for materials with ceramic concentrations of 2% volume or less. Zener-Hollomon constituent analyses were also completed to elucidate a more comprehensive understanding the flow behavior inherent to each material. Flow behavior varied directly with the sintered density, which was influenced by the concentration and nature of ceramic particulate. © 2018 by the authors.

We consider two cases depending on whether the period of time sustained at or above level b is counted either consecutively or accumulatively (referred to as standard or cumulative waiting period). In both cases, we develop a recursive computational procedure to calculate the expected total discounted dividend payments made prior to ruin for a discrete-time Sparre Andersen renewal risk process. By varying the values of b and h, a numerical study of the trade-off effects between finite-time ruin probabilities and expected total discounted dividend payments is investigated under a variety of scenarios. Finally, a generalized threshold-based strategy with a delayed dividend payment rule is studied under the compound binomial model. © 2018 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.",Compound binomial model; Discrete-time Sparre Andersen renewal risk process; Dividend payments; Parisian-type model; Ruin probabilities; Threshold strategy; Waiting period,,,American Institute of Mathematical Sciences,15475816,,,,English,J.

Second, based on this unified probability framework, a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with some new terms was constructed. Third, with this LKF and some inequality technologies, a less conservative criterion was established, which can ensure the stochastic stability of the error system.

Methods Adult smokers from online panels in Canada (n=2357), Australia (n=1671) and Mexico (n=2537) were surveyed every 4 months from 2012 to 2013. Participants were shown PHWs on packs in their respective countries and asked about: (1) noticing PHWs; (2) negative affects towards PHWs; (3) believability of PHWs; (4) PHW-stimulated discussions; and (5) quit motivation due to PHWs. Country-specific generalised estimating equation models regressed these outcomes on time (ie, survey wave), PHW imagery type (ie, symbolic representations of risk, suffering from smoking and graphic depictions of bodily harm) and interactions between them. Results In all countries, PHW responses did not significantly change over time, except for increased noticing PHWs in Canada and Mexico, increased negative affect in Australia and decreased negative affect in Mexico. For all outcomes, symbolic PHWs were rated lower than suffering and graphic PHWs in Canada (the only country with symbolic PHWs). Graphic PHWs were rated higher than suffering PHWs for negative affect (all countries), discussions (Canada) and quit motivation (Australia). Suffering PHWs were rated higher than graphic PHWs for noticing PHWs (Canada), believability (all countries), discussions (AustraliaandMexico) and quit motivation (Mexico). Changes in noticing, believability and discussions varied somewhat by imagery type across countries. Conclusions The different PHW imagery appears to have different pathways of influence on adult smokers. Reactions to specific PHWs are similar over 1-2 years, suggesting that wear-out of PHW effects is due to decreased attention rather than the diminishing effectiveness of content. © 2018 Author(s).",communication; graphic warning; policy; tobacco control,adult; article; attention; Australia; Canada; female; human; imagery; major clinical study; male; Mexico; motivation; risk assessment; smoking,,BMJ Publishing Group,20446055,,,,English,BMJ Open,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050278216,

They have been at the forefront of the development of synthetic aperture, plane wave, shear wave elastography, and vector flow imaging. Such platforms are driven by a need for broad flexibility of parameters that are normally preset or fixed within clinical scanners. OP ultrasound scanners are defined to have three key features including customization of the transmit waveform, access to the prebeamformed receive data, and the ability to implement real-time imaging. In this paper, a formative discussion is given on the development of OPs from both the research community and the commercial sector. Both software- and hardware-based architectures are considered, and their specifications are compared in terms of resources and programmability. Software-based platforms capable of real-time beamforming generally make use of scalable graphics processing unit architectures, whereas a common feature of hardware-based platforms is the use of field-programmable gate array and digital signal processor devices to provide additional on-board processing capacity.

An investigation was conducted to determine whether contrast-balanced binocular treatment  a strategy currently being explored for children with anisometropic and strabismic amblyopia  may be effective in children with deprivation amblyopia. Methods: An unmasked, case-series design intended to assess proof of principle was employed. Eighteen children with deprivation amblyopia due to childhood cataracts (early bilateral n = 7, early unilateral n = 7, developmental n = 4), as well as 10 children with anisometropic (n = 8) or mixed anisometropic and strabismic amblyopia (n = 2) were prescribed one hour a day of treatment over a six-week period. Supervised treatment was available. Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, global motion perception and interocular suppression were measured pre- and post-treatment. Results: Visual acuity improvements occurred in the anisometropic/strabismic group (0.15 ± 0.05 logMAR, p = 0.014), but contrast sensitivity did not change. As a group, children with deprivation amblyopia had a smaller but statistically significant improvement in weaker eye visual acuity (0.09 ± 0.03 logMAR, p = 0.004), as well a significant improvement in weaker eye contrast sensitivity (p = 0.004). Subgroup analysis suggested that the children with early bilateral deprivation had the largest improvements, while children with early unilateral cataract did not improve. Interestingly, binocular contrast sensitivity also improved in children with early bilateral deprivation. Global motion perception improved for both subgroups with early visual deprivation, as well as children with anisometropic or mixed anisometropic/strabismic amblyopia. Interocular suppression improved for all subgroups except children with early unilateral deprivation. Conclusion: These data suggest that supervised contrast-balanced binocular treatment should be further investigated as a treatment option for children with deprivation amblyopia. However, for children with more severe deprivation amblyopia due to early unilateral cataracts, supplementary or alternative options should also be explored. © 2017 Optometry Australia",binocular treatment; deprivation amblyopia; paediatric cataracts,"adolescent; amblyopia; binocular vision; cataract; cataract extraction; child; complication; contrast sensitivity; follow up; human; infant; lens implantation; pathophysiology; physiology; preschool child; prospective study; pseudophakia; sensory deprivation; spectacles; visual acuity; Adolescent; Amblyopia; Cataract; Cataract Extraction; Child; Child, Preschool; Contrast Sensitivity; Eyeglasses; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant; Lens Implantation, Intraocular; Prospective Studies; Pseudophakia; Sensory Deprivation; Vision, Binocular; Visual Acuity",,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,8164622,,CEOPE,29193320,English,Clin.

This study reports on the ability of the Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) questionnaire to detect dry eye (DE) symptoms in contact lens (CL) and non-CL wearers. METHODS. The SPEED questionnaire was administered to all subjects while the Contact Lens Dry Eye Questionnaire-8 (CLDEQ-8) was only administered to CL wearers. Tear meniscus heights (TMH) were measured, and the phenol red thread (PRT) test was conducted. These tests along with self-reported DE were used to identify subjects with dry eye disease (DED). Rasch analysis was performed to evaluate the questionnaires for measurement precision and unidimensionality, and the scores from these Rasch analyses were used to understand their ability to predict measures of DED. RESULTS. We enrolled 284 subjects (150 CL and 134 non-CL wearers). Mean subject age was 39.4 ± 14.2 years. Rasch analysis yielded a multidimensional short form of the SPEED questionnaire (8-items) and a unidimensional short form of the CLDEQ-8 (4-item). Scores from both questionnaires were significantly associated with self-reported DE in CL and non-CL wearers. Scores of the 8-item SPEED questionnaire were associated with DED status in non-CL wearers but not in CL wearers while 4-item CLDEQ scores were associated with DED status in CL wearers. TMH or PRT were not associated with either questionnaire in CL or non-CL wearers. CONCLUSIONS. The 8-item SPEED questionnaire demonstrated adequate measurement precision with evidence of quantifying multiple symptoms categories while the 4-item CLDEQ-8 primarily quantified DE symptoms. Questionnaire scores were associated with self-reported DE, which suggests that they may have utility in both populations analyzed. © 2018 The Authors.",Contact lens dry eye questionnaire-8 (CLDEQ-8); Contact lenses; Dry eye disease; Rasch analysis; Standard patient evaluation of eye dryness (SPEED),adult; Article; Contact Lens Dry Eye Questionnaire 8; cross-sectional study; diagnostic test; dry eye; female; human; ligament rupture; male; measurement accuracy; meibomian gland dysfunction; phenol red thread test; priority journal; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; Rasch analysis; scoring system; Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness Questionnaire; tear meniscus height; visual system parameters; adverse device effect; chemistry; comparative study; contact lens; dry eye; lacrimal fluid; middle aged; psychometry; self report; Sickness Impact Profile; young adult; Adult; Contact Lenses; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dry Eye Syndromes; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Self Report; Sickness Impact Profile; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tears; Young Adult,,Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.,1460404,,IOVSD,30025086,English,Invest.

We aimed to compare the risk of GC among immigrants to Ontario, Canada, to the risk of GC in its general population. Methods: This was a retrospective population-based matched cohort study from 1991 to 2014. We identified immigrants who were first eligible for the Ontario Health Insurance Plan at age 40 years or older, and matched 5 controls by year of birth and sex. We calculated crude rates and relative rates of GC stratified by sex. We modeled GC hazard using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, where a time-varying coefficient was incorporated to examine changes in the association of immigrant status with GC hazard over time. Results: Among females, 415 GC cases were identified among 209,843 immigrants and 1872 among 1,049,215 controls. Among males, 596 GC cases were identified among 191,792 immigrants and 2998 among 958,960 controls. Comparing immigrants from East Asia and Pacific with the controls, the crude relative rate of GC was 1.54 for females and 1.32 for males. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for GC among female immigrants was 1.29 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12, 1.48] within 10 years and 1.19 (1.01, 1.40) beyond 10 years; for males, the HR was 1.17 (1.04, 1.31) within 10 years and 1.00 (0.87, 1.15) beyond 10 years. Conclusion: The risk of GC among immigrants is elevated. Although high-risk immigrant populations in Ontario have been identified, further knowledge is required before a program of GC prevention that is targeted to them can be planned. © 2017, The International Gastric Cancer Association and The Japanese Gastric Cancer Association.",Cox regression model with time-varying coefficient; Gastric cancer; Immigrants; Matched cohort study; Relative rate,adult; age distribution; aged; Article; cancer risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; East Asian; female; hazard ratio; high risk population; human; immigrant; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Ontario; priority journal; retrospective study; stomach cancer; case control study; Far East; migrant; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; stomach tumor; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Emigrants and Immigrants; Far East; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Risk Factors; Stomach Neoplasms,,Springer Tokyo,14363291,,GCANF,29285629,English,Gastric Cancer,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039556730,

Preexisting chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and asthma were thought to predict risk of progression to severe infections. Objective We aimed to quantify the frequency of chronic comorbidities in flavivirus diseases to provide an estimate for their prevalence in severe and non-severe infections and examine whether chronic diseases contribute to the increased risk of severe viral expression. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase and Embase Classic and grey literature databases to identify studies reporting prevalence estimates of comorbidities in flavivirus diseases. Study quality was assessed with the risk of bias tool. Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for severe infection in the presence of chronic comorbidities. Results We identified 65 studies as eligible for inclusion for DENV (47 studies) and WNV (18 studies). Obesity and overweight (i.e., BMI&gt; 25 kg/m2, prevalence: 24.5%, 95% CI: 18.631.6%), hypertension (17.1%, 13.321.8%) and diabetes (13.3%, 9.318.8%) were the most prevalent comorbidities in DENV. However, hypertension (45.0%, 39.151.0%), diabetes (24.7%, 20.229.8%) and heart diseases (25.6%, 19.532.7%) were the most prevalent in WNV. ORs of severe flavivirus diseases were about 2 to 4 in infected patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases. The small number of studies in JEV, YFV and Zika did not permit estimating the prevalence of comorbidities in these infections. Conclusion Higher prevalence of chronic comorbidities was found in severe cases of flavivirus diseases compared to non-severe cases. Findings of the present study may guide public health practitioners and clinicians to evaluate infection severity based on the presence of comorbidity, a critical public health measure that may avert severe disease outcome given the current dearth of clear prevention practices for some flavivirus diseases. © 2018 Badawi et al.

Elevated levels of vaginal inflammation has been associated with the increased risk of HIV infection as it brings highly activated HIV target cells (CCR5+CD4+ T cells; CCR5+CD4+CD161+ Th17 T cells) to the female genital tract (FGT) where they interact with HIV. Decreased HIV risk has been associated with a phenotype of decreased immune activation, called immune quiescence, described among Kenyan female sex workers who were intensely exposed to HIV yet remain uninfected. Current prevention approaches focus on limiting viral access. We took the novel HIV prevention approach of trying to limit the number of HIV target cells in the genital tract by reducing inflammation using safe, affordable and globally accessible anti-inflammatory drugs. Methods: We hypothesized that the daily administration of low doses of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA 81 mg) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ 200 mg) would reduce inflammation thereby decreasing HIV target cells at the FGT. Low-risk HIV seronegative women from Nairobi, Kenya were randomized for six weeks therapy of ASA (n = 37) or HCQ (n = 39) and tested to determine the impact on their systemic and mucosal immune environment. Results: The results showed that HCQ use was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of systemic T cells that were CCR5+CD4+ (p = 0.01) and Th17 (p = 0.01). In the ASA arm, there was a 35% and 28% decrease in the proportion of genital T cells that were CD4+CCR5+ (p = 0.017) and Th17 (p = 0.04) respectively. Proteomic analyses of the cervical lavage showed ASA use was associated with significantly reduced amount of proteins involved in the inflammatory response and cell recruitment at the mucosa, although none of the individual proteins passed multiple comparison correction. These changes were more apparent in women with Lactobacillus dominant microbiomes. Conclusion: Together, these data indicate that taking low-dose ASA daily was associated with significant reduction in HIV target cells at the FGT. This study provides proof-of-concept for a novel HIV-prevention approach that reducing inflammation using safe, affordable and globally accessible non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents is associated with significant reduction in the proportion of HIV-target cells at the FGT. © 2018 The Authors.

Elevated concentrations of nitrite have been observed in the Seine River, raising questions about its sources and fate. Here, we assess the role of bottom sediments as potential sources or sinks of nitrite along the river continuum. Sediment cores were collected from two depocenters, one located upstream, the other downstream, from the largest wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) servicing the conurbation of Paris. Pore water profiles of oxygen, nitrate, nitrite and ammonium were measured. Ammonium, nitrate and nitrite fluxes across the sediment-water interface (SWI) were determined in separate core incubation experiments. The data were interpreted with a one-dimensional, multi-component reactive transport model, which accounts for the production and consumption of nitrite through nitrification, denitrification, anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). In all core incubation experiments, nitrate uptake by the sediments was observed, indicative of high rates of denitrification. In contrast, for both sampling locations, the sediments in cores collected in August 2012 acted as sinks for nitrite, but those collected in October 2013 released nitrite to the overlying water. The model results suggest that the first step of nitrification generated most pore water nitrite at the two locations. While nitrification was also the main pathway consuming nitrite in the sediments upstream of the WWTP, anammox dominated nitrite removal at the downstream site. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the magnitude and direction of the benthic nitrite fluxes most strongly depend on bottom water oxygenation and the deposition flux of labile organic matter. © 2018 The Authors",Anammox; Benthic exchanges; Denitrification; DNRA; Nitrification; Nitrite; Reactive transport modeling; River sediments; Seine,Denitrification; Nitrates; Nitrification; Nitrogen removal; Sediments; Sensitivity analysis; Wastewater treatment; Water; ANAMMOX; DNRA; Nitrite; Reactive transport modeling; River sediments; Seine; Rivers; ammonia; nitrate; nitrite; oxygen; water; ammonium; benthos; denitrification; depocenter; diagenesis; fluvial deposit; nitrification; nitrite; nitrogen cycle; numerical model; oxygenation; reactive transport; sediment chemistry; sediment core; sediment-water interface; wastewater treatment plant; Article; benthos; chemical model; chemical sink; concentration (parameters); denitrification; diagenesis; France; mathematical model; nitrate uptake; nitrification; priority journal; river ecosystem; sediment; source sink relationship; waste water treatment plant; France; Ile de France; Paris; Seine River [France]; Ville de Paris,,Elsevier B.V.,489697,,STEVA,,English,Sci.

Although surgery can improve quality and duration of life, it can also precipitate major complications. Moreover, a substantial proportion of deaths occur after discharge. Current systems for monitoring patients postoperatively, on surgical wards and after transition to home, are inadequate. On the surgical ward, vital signs evaluation usually occurs only every 4-8 hours. Reduced in-hospital ward monitoring, followed by no vital signs monitoring at home, leads to thousands of cases of undetected/delayed detection of hemodynamic compromise. In this article we review work to date on postoperative remote automated monitoring on surgical wards and strategy for advancing this field. Key considerations for overcoming current barriers to implementing remote automated monitoring in Canada are also presented. © 2018 The Authors",,"amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; ambulatory care; automation; breathing rate; Canada; core temperature; cost effectiveness analysis; economic evaluation; electrocardiogram; electronic patient record; health care cost; health care policy; heart rate; heart rate variability; home monitoring; hospital discharge; hospital information system; hospital readmission; human; hypotension; intensive care unit; Internet; machine learning; medical technology; non invasive procedure; oxygen saturation; patient monitoring; patient transport; postoperative care; postoperative complication; postoperative remote automated monitoring; program effectiveness; pulse oximetry; randomized controlled trial (topic); remote sensing; Review; risk assessment; science; skin temperature; surgical mortality; surgical patient; surgical ward; telemedicine; telemonitoring; vital sign; physiologic monitoring; physiology; postoperative care; procedures; surgery; Humans; Monitoring, Physiologic; Postoperative Care; Surgical Procedures, Operative; Telemedicine; Vital Signs",,Elsevier Inc.,0828282X,,CJCAE,29960614,English,Can.

Benefits have been identified for recreational gamblers (those experiencing no gambling-related problems), but there are many social, financial, and health harms affecting quality of life related to gambling across the spectrum of risk levels. Because of their greater numbers, low and moderate risk (LMR) older adult gamblers are responsible for higher levels of population harm. Therefore, this study examines outcomes experienced by older adults who participate in gambling at recreational and LMR levels to better understand protective factors that contribute to quality of life. Guided by activity theory and a modified self-complexity model, we explore how leisure complexity and employment buffer the relationship between gambler type and factors associated with well-being, namely social support (both perceived and received) and stress. A sub-sample of 3232 adults, age 55 years and older, who gambled in the past year was drawn from the 20132014 Canadian Community Health Survey. Data were analyzed using linear regression with moderation, focusing on the interactions of gambling risk level with leisure complexity and employment. Recreational gamblers reported greater role complexity and more diverse leisure lifestyles, both of which were associated with greater social support and reduced stress. Life stress was higher among older adults who worked for pay. Even so, having a job appeared to temper stress levels among LMR gamblers, suggesting the importance of maintaining a diversity of social roles and leisure activities, where possible, to enhance quality of life. © 2018 The Author(s)",Leisure complexity; Low and moderate risk gambling; Older adults; Quality of life; Social support,,,Springer Netherlands,18712584,,,,English,Appl.

An independent expert group (EG) was established to conduct the impact assessment, and report their findings at COP7 (Delhi, November 2016). This article describes the methodology used by the EG to conduct the first comprehensive multi-method assessment of the possible causal impact of the FCTC on global tobacco control over the past decade. Methods: The EG developed and followed a four-stage process model to conduct the impact assessment: (1) desk review of literature on FCTC impact; (2) collection and analysis of interview data from 12 country missions; (3) data synthesis and interpretation; and (4) preparation of a final report. Conclusions: The EG developed and engaged in a transparent and systematic process to conduct the FCTC impact assessment. The methods employed were rigorous, and explicitly guided by concerns about the difficulty of ascribing cause-and-effect relations. The EG's report and supporting documents represent important sources of the positive impact of the Convention over its first decade. As development of the FCTC increasingly shifts to mechanisms for accelerating global implementation, the EG's process model can be used as a methodology to assist Parties in carrying out their own assessments of the impact of the Treaty. © World Health Organization [2018].

The threshold of the binary hypothesis for energy detection is generally determined by using the principles of constant false alarm rate (CFAR) or constant detection rate (CDR). The CDR principle guarantees the CR primary users at a designated low level of interferences, which is nonetheless subject to low spectrum usability of secondary users in a given sensing latency. On the other hand, the CFAR principle ensures secondary users spectrum utilization at a designated high level, while may nonetheless lead to a high level of interference to the primary users. The paper introduces a novel framework of energy detection for CR spectrum sensing, aiming to initiate a graceful compromise between the two reported principles. The proposed framework takes advantage of the summation of the false alarm probability P f a from CFAR and the missed detection probability (1 ? P d ) from CDR, which is further compared with a predetermined confidence level. Optimization presentations for the proposed framework to determine some key parameters are developed and analyzed. We identify two fundamental limitations that appear in spectrum sensing, which further define the relationship among the sample data size for detection, detection time, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We claim that the proposed framework of energy detection yields merits in practical policymaking for detection time and design sample rate on specific channels to achieve better efficiency and less interferences. © 2018 by the authors.",Energy detection; Fundamental limitations; Noise variance; SNR; Spectrum sensing,,,MDPI AG,22242708,,,,English,J.

AcdS reduces the level of stress ethylene to below the point where it is inhibitory to plant growth. The study determined that several mechanisms appear to be responsible for the increased salinity tolerance and that the effect of acdS on gene expression patterns in C. sativa roots during salt stress is a function of how it is delivered. Growth in soil treated with the PGPB (Pseudomonas migulae 8R6) mostly affected ethylene- and abscisic acid-dependent signaling in a positive way, while expression of acdS in transgenic lines under the control of the broadly active CaMV 35S promoter or the root-specific rolD promoter affected auxin, jasmonic acid and brassinosteroid signaling and/biosynthesis. The expression of genes involved in minor carbohydrate metabolism were also up-regulated, mainly in roots of lines expressing acdS. Expression of acdS also affected the expression of genes involved in modulating the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to prevent cellular damage, while permitting ROS-dependent signal transduction.

To better understand natural processes and their potential future trajectories requires improved integration with and quantification of human processes. Similarly, to mitigate risk and facilitate socio-economic development requires a better understanding of how the natural system (e.g. climate variability and change, extreme weather events, and processes affecting soil fertility) affects human processes. Our understanding of these interactions and feedback between human and natural systems has been formalized through a variety of modelling approaches. However, a common conceptual framework or set of guidelines to model human-natural-system feedbacks is lacking. The presented research lays out a conceptual framework that includes representing model coupling configuration in combination with the frequency of interaction and coordination of communication between coupled models. Four different approaches used to couple representations of the human and natural system are presented in relation to this framework, which vary in the processes represented and in the scale of their application. From the development and experience associated with the four models of coupled human-natural systems, the following eight lessons were identified that if taken into account by future coupled human-natural-systems model developments may increase their success: (1) leverage the power of sensitivity analysis with models, (2) remember modelling is an iterative process, (3) create a common language, (4) make code open-access, (5) ensure consistency, (6) reconcile spatio-temporal mismatch, (7) construct homogeneous units, and (8) incorporating feedback increases non-linearity and variability. Following a discussion of feedbacks, a way forward to expedite model coupling and increase the longevity and interoperability of models is given, which suggests the use of a wrapper container software, a standardized applications programming interface (API), the incorporation of standard names, the mitigation of sunk costs by creating interfaces to multiple coupling frameworks, and the adoption of reproducible workflow environments to wire the pieces together. © Author(s) 2018.",,Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Climate change; Economics; Sensitivity analysis; Applications programming interfaces; Climate variability and change; Conceptual frameworks; Coupled human-natural systems; Earth's resources; Extreme weather events; Natural variability; Socio-economic development; Modeling languages; conceptual framework; feedback mechanism; modeling; sensitivity analysis,,Copernicus GmbH,21904979,,,,English,Earth Syst.

It uses multiple regression directly to predict proximity to a geological feature (the response variable) from selected geochemical elements (explanatory variables). Lithogeochemical data from the Ben Nevis map area (Ontario, Canada) is used as an example application. The regression model was trained with geochemical samples occurring within 3 km of the Canagau Mines deposit. The resulting multielement model predicts the proximity to another prospective area, the Croxall property, where similar mineralization occurs, and model coefficients may help in understanding what constitutes a good multielement vector to mineralization. The approach can also be applied in 3-D situations to borehole data to predict presence of multielement geochemical haloes around an orebody. Residual principal components analysis is another exploratory multivariate method. After applying a conventional principal components analysis, a subset of PCs is used as explanatory variables to predict a selected (single) element, separating the element into predicted and residual parts to facilitate interpretation. The method is illustrated using lake sediment data from Nunavut Territory, Canada to separate uranium associated with two different granites, the Nueltin granite and the Hudson granite. This approach has the potential to facilitate the interpretation of multielement data that has been affected by multiple geological processes, often the situation with surficial geochemical surveys. © Springer International Publishing AG.

Following adjustments for censoring and dropping highly censored elements, a total of 41 elements were retained. A logcentred transform was applied to the data followed by the application of a principal component analysis. Using the 10 most dominant principal components for each layer (surface soil, A-horizon, C-horizon) the application of random forest classification analysis reveals continental-scale spatial features that reflect bedrock source variability. Classification accuracies range from near zero to greater than 74% for 17 surface lithologies that have been mapped across the conterminous United States. The differences of classification accuracy between the Surface Layer, A- and C-Horizons do not vary significantly. This approach confirms that the soil geochemistry across the conterminous United States retains the characteristics of the underlying geology regardless of the position in the soil profile. © Springer International Publishing AG.

They correspond to patterns of long-range entanglement. In recent years, it was shown that in 1+1D bosonic systems, there is no nontrivial topological order, while in 2+1D bosonic systems, the topological orders are classified by the following pair: a modular tensor category and a chiral central charge. In this paper, following a new line of thinking, we find that in 3+1D the classification is much simpler than it was thought to be; we propose a partial classification of topological orders for 3+1D bosonic systems: If all the pointlike excitations are bosons, then such topological orders are classified by a simpler pair (G,?4): a finite group G and its group 4-cocycle ?4-H4[G;U(1)] (up to group automorphisms). Furthermore, all such 3+1D topological orders can be realized by Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories. © 2018 authors.

To test whether oceanic anoxia might have played a role in this evolutionary event, we measured U isotope compositions (d238U) in sedimentary carbonates from the Dengying Formation of South China to obtain new constraints on the extent of global redox change during the terminal Ediacaran. We found the most negative carbonate d238U values yet reported (?0.95 per mil), which were reproduced in two widely spaced coeval sections spanning the terminal Ediacaran Period (551 to 541 million years ago). Mass balance modeling indicates an episode of extensive oceanic anoxia, during which anoxia covered &gt;21% of the seafloor and most U entering the oceans was removed into sediments below anoxic waters. The results suggest that an expansion of oceanic anoxia and temporal-spatial redox heterogeneity, independent of other environmental and ecological factors, may have contributed to the decline of the Ediacara biota and may have also stimulated animal motility.

Controlling a section of the trailing edge of the turbine airfoil is found to reduce load fluctuations on wind turbine blades. Here a detailed experimental setup is described showing the development of a compact airfoil section capable of measuring the surface pressure, root bending moment, and controlling a TEF simultaneously and in time resolved fashion to quantity the influence of a TEF on a wind turbine. This experimental work includes a trailing edge flap that covers 20% of an S833 airfoil with a chord of 178 mm. Surface pressure and blade root strain are measured for varying angles of attack and flap angle. Coefficient of lift and moment are obtained from the 54 pressure taps. The lift and drag forces are also obtained from the strain gages at the root of the blade. A 3D printed blade section is designed and built to house the actuation and sensing on the airfoil. The trailing edge flap was tested inside a 0.61 m wind tunnel as a baseline case and the results showed how the lift, drag, and root moment on the airfoil can change for different flap angles. The coefficient of lift changed by 30% for flap angle of 20°.

The objective of this research was to generate a skin microbiota baseline for members of the class Mammalia, testing the effects of host species, geographic location, body region, and biological sex. Skin from the back, torso, and inner thighs of 177 nonhuman mammals was sampled, representing individuals from 38 species and 10 mammalian orders. Animals were sampled from farms, zoos, households, and the wild. The DNA extracts from all skin swabs were amplified by PCR and sequenced, targeting the V3-V4 regions of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes. Previously published skin microbiome data from 20 human participants, sampled and sequenced using an identical protocol to the nonhuman mammals, were included to make this a comprehensive analysis. Human skin microbial communities were distinct and significantly less diverse than all other sampled mammalian orders. The factor most strongly associated with microbial community data for all samples was whether the host was a human. Within nonhuman samples, host taxonomic order was the most significant factor influencing skin microbiota, followed by the geographic location of the habitat. By comparing the congruence between host phylogeny and microbial community dendrograms, we observed that Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates) and Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates) had significant congruence, providing evidence of phylosymbiosis between skin microbial communities and their hosts. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

These interactions are commonly assessed by monitoring changes in chemical water quality, but this might not be indicative for microbial contamination. The hydrological dynamics of the infiltrating river can influence these interactions, but seasonal temperature fluctuations and the supply of oxygen and nutrients from the surface water can also play a role. In order to understand the interaction between surface water and groundwater in a highly dynamic RBF system of a large river, bacterial abundance, biomass and carbon production as well as standard chemical parameters were analyzed during a 20 month period under different hydrological conditions. In the investigated RBF system, groundwater table changes exhibited striking dynamics even though flow velocities were rather low under regular discharge conditions. Bacterial abundance, biomass, and bacterial carbon production decreased significantly from the river towards the drinking water abstraction well. The cell size distribution changed from a higher proportion of large cells in the river, towards a higher proportion of small cells in the groundwater. Although biomass and bacterial abundance were correlated to water temperatures and several other chemical parameters in the river, such correlations were not present in the groundwater. In contrast, the dynamics of the bacterial groundwater community was predominantly governed by the hydrogeological dynamics. Especially during flood events, large riverine bacteria infiltrated further into the aquifer compared to average discharge conditions. With such information at hand, drinking water utilities are able to improve their water abstraction strategies and react quicker to changing hydrological conditions in the RBF system. © 2018 The Authors",Bacterial abundance; Bacterial production; Hydrological dynamics; Riverbank filtration; Surface water  groundwater interaction,Abstracting; Aquifers; Biomass; Carbon; Chemical analysis; Dynamics; Floods; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Oxygen supply; Potable water; Radial basis function networks; Rivers; Water filtration; Water quality; Bacterial abundance; Bacterial carbon production; Bacterial production; Groundwater interaction; Riverbank filtration; Riverbank filtration systems; Seasonal temperature fluctuations; Surface water and groundwaters; Hydrochemistry; carbon; drinking water; ground water; surface water; ground water; abundance; biomass; drinking water; filtration; flow velocity; groundwater-surface water interaction; hydrogeology; hydrological regime; microbial activity; river bank; spatiotemporal analysis; water industry; aquifer; Article; bacterial cell; bacterium; cell count; cell size; chemical parameters; controlled study; filtration; flooding; flow rate; hydrodynamics; hydrology; microbial biomass; microbial community; nonhuman; population abundance; priority journal; river; riverbank filtration system; spatiotemporal analysis; water quality; water temperature; biomass; environmental monitoring; filtration; microbiology; river; spatiotemporal analysis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Biomass; Environmental Monitoring; Filtration; Groundwater; Rivers; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Water Microbiology,,Elsevier B.V.,489697,,STEVA,29426167,English,Sci.

We introduce an experimental approach to realize universal quantum control, and benchmarking thereof, in zero-field NMR, an analog of conventional high-field NMR that features less-constrained spin dynamics. We design a composite pulse technique for both arbitrary one-spin rotations and a two-spin controlled-not (CNOT) gate in a heteronuclear two-spin system at zero field, which experimentally demonstrates universal quantum control in such a system. Moreover, using quantum informationinspired randomized benchmarking and partial quantum process tomography, we evaluate the quality of the control, achieving single-spin control for 13C with an average fidelity of 0.9960(2) and two-spin control via a CNOT gate with a fidelity of 0.9877(2). Our method can also be extended to more general multispin heteronuclear systems at zero field. The realization of universal quantum control in zero-field NMR is important for quantum state/coherence preparation, pulse sequence design, and is an essential step toward applications to materials science, chemical analysis, and fundamental physics.

This study was designed to (1) examine how support for a PoS cigarette display ban changed among Dutch smokers between 2010 and 2015 and (2) identify the variables that predict support among smokers for a PoS cigarette display ban. Methods: Longitudinal data from six annual survey waves (2010-2015) from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Netherlands Survey were analyzed. The sample consisted of between 1279 and 1800 smokers per year. Smokers were asked whether they supported a complete ban on displays of cigarettes inside shops and stores. Results: Support for a PoS cigarette display ban increased from 28.9% in 2010 to 42.5% in 2015 (OR = 1.40, p < 0.001). A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that support for a PoS display ban of cigarettes was more likely among smokers who had more knowledge about the health risks of smoking (OR = 3.97, p < 0.001), believed smoking-related health risks to be severe (OR = 1.39, p < 0.001), had a more positive attitude towards quitting smoking (OR = 1.44, p = 0.006), reported stronger social norms to quit smoking (OR = 1.29, p = 0.035), had a higher self-efficacy for quitting smoking (OR = 1.31, p = 0.001), and had stronger intentions to quit smoking (OR = 1.23, p = 0.006). Conclusions: This paper showed that support for a PoS display ban of cigarettes increased among smokers in the Netherlands over the years. To further increase support, educational campaigns about the dangers of smoking, and campaigns that encourage quitting may be needed. © 2018 The Author(s).",Point of sale; Smokers; Support; The Netherlands; Tobacco display ban,article; cigarette; controlled study; health hazard; human; major clinical study; multivariate logistic regression analysis; Netherlands; self concept; smoking cessation; social norm,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712458,,,29902984,English,BMC Public Health,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048641129,

Green finance has been growing rapidly in China since the government issued its Green Credit Policy. The objective of this study is to explore whether green loans are less risky than non-green loans. Based on a five-year dataset of 24 Chinese banks, we used panel regression techniques, including two-stage least square regression analysis and random-effect panel regression to examine whether a higher green credit ratio reduces a bank's non-performing loan ratio (NPL ratio). The results suggest that allocating more green loans to the total loan portfolio does reduce a bank's NPL ratio. We conclude that institutional pressure by the Chinese Green Credit Policy has a positive effect on both the environmental and the financial performance of banks. The study contributes to the literature on the correlation between green lending and credit risks, as well as to the literature on the impact of institutional pressure on environmental and financial risks. © 2018 by the authors.",Chinese banking sector; Environmental risk management; Green credit policy; Green finance; Non-performing loan ratio,banking; credit provision; data set; economic policy; environmental risk; government; green economy; industrial policy; risk assessment; China,,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048583715,

Evidence from around Antarctica indicates that ice shelves are thinning and weakening, primarily driven by warm ocean water entering into the shelf cavities. We have identified a mechanism for ice shelf destabilization where basal channels underneath the shelves cause ice thinning that drives fracture perpendicular to flow. These channels also result in ice surface deformation, which diverts supraglacial rivers into the transverse fractures. We report direct evidence that a major 2016 calving event at Nansen Ice Shelf in the Ross Sea was the result of fracture driven by such channelized thinning and demonstrate that similar basal channeldriven transverse fractures occur elsewhere in Greenland and Antarctica. In the event of increased basal and surface melt resulting from rising ocean and air temperatures, ice shelves will become increasingly vulnerable to these tandem effects of basal channel destabilization.

The coexistence of ammonium and nitrate has been observed in almost all the investigated monitoring wells, reaching maximum values of 100 and 200 mg/L for both species. Chloride and potassium concentration coupled with groundwater stable isotopes data show the influence of local and urban recharge and the occurrence of seawater intrusion in areas near the coastline. ?15NNH4 + values ranging between ?4.9 and +14.9% suggest that different processes such as partial nitrification of ammonium, probably anammox activities and sorption, are occurring at the site. The isotope data for NH4 + also showed the existence of the remnant of an old fertilizer plume in the downgradient area. The nitrate isotope data ranging between +9 and +46% and +6 and +26% for ?15NNO3 ? and ?18ONO3 ?, respectively, suggest that nitrate content is attenuated by denitrification and probably annamox. The fast groundwater flow field is one of the reasons for the coexistence of NH4 + and NO3 ? in groundwater, since both compounds can penetrate the reducing zone of the aquifer.

As an example, we numerically construct the most general class of planar black holes coupled to a single scalar field in the consistent truncation of type IIB supergravity that preserves the SO(3)×SO(3) R-symmetry group of the gauge theory. For this particular family of solutions, we find that the speed of sound exceeds the conformal value. From a phenomenological point of view, the fact that the conformal bound can be violated by choosing the right mixed boundary conditions is relevant for the existence of neutron stars with a certain mass-size relationship for which a large value of the speed of sound codifies a stiff equation of state. In the way, we also shed light on a puzzle regarding the appearance of the scalar charges in the first law. Finally, we generalize the formula of the speed of sound to arbitrary dimensional scalar-metric theories whose parameters lie within the BreitenlohnerFreedman window. © 2018 The Author(s)",,,,Elsevier B.V.,3702693,,PYLBA,,English,Phys Lett Sect B Nucl Elem Part High-Energy Phys,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046376566,

However, multi-window operations result in unnecessary energy drain due to increased multitasking, CPU load, and multithread processing. Considering linear dependence between power consumed and the displayed colors, we present the design and realization of MultiDroid, a novel display power reduction technique during multi-window operations for the OLED screens. MultiDroid employs dynamic local dimming based on the context switching between the application pairs displayed on the screen. The display optimization works based on the user interaction with the mobile screen, where dynamic changes on the display screens are implemented for the non-critical application window. MultiDroid architecture is validated through power modeling and correctness verification. Furthermore, a survey on multi-window usage has been conducted reflecting the application usage pattern. The performance of MultiDroid is evaluated on preferred application pairs on multi-window framework obtained from the survey. Modeling and comparative analysis of the energy profiles for the devised test cases on optimized and default multi-window screens reflect around 10% to 25% reduction in the overall device power consumption per hour with a negligible performance degradation. After experimental validation, we present user acceptance and feasibility of MultiDroid based on the feedback from 50 participants. © 2013 IEEE.",display power management; local dimming; multi-window; OLED screen; Smartphone screen,Electric power utilization; Flow visualization; Liquid crystal displays; Multitasking; Optimization; Smartphones; Solar cells; Surveys; Visualization; Correctness verifications; Display power managements; Experimental validations; Local dimming; Multi-Windows; Performance degradation; Power demands; Power reduction techniques; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED),,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048481622,

Data sources: Published reports on global FCTC implementation; searches of four databases through June 2016; hand-search of publications/online resources; tobacco control experts. Study selection: WHO Convention Secretariat global progress reports (2010, 2012, 2014); 2015 WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic; studies of social, behavioural, health, economic and/or environmental impacts of FCTC policies. Data extraction: Progress in the implementation of 17 FCTC Articles was categorised (higher/intermediate/lower) by consensus. 128 studies were independently selected by multiple authors in consultation with experts. Data synthesis: Implementation was highest for smoke-free laws, health warnings and education campaigns, youth access laws, and reporting/information exchange, and lowest for measures to counter industry interference, regulate tobacco product contents, promote alternative livelihoods and protect health/environment. Price/tax increases, comprehensive smoking and marketing bans, health warnings, and cessation treatment are associated with decreased tobacco consumption/health risks and increased quitting. Mass media campaigns and youth access laws prevent smoking initiation, decrease prevalence and promote cessation. There were few studies on the effectiveness of policies in several domains, including measures to prevent industry interference and regulate tobacco product contents. Conclusions: The FCTC has increased the implementation of measures across several policy domains, and these implementations have resulted in measurable impacts on tobacco consumption, prevalence and other outcomes. However, FCTC implementation must be accelerated, and Parties need to meet all their Treaty obligations and consider measures that exceed minimum requirements. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

Besides drug treatment, deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) has developed as an effective therapy. Goal: We present a neural model that simulates a syllable repetition task and evaluate its performance when varying the level of dopamine in the striatum, and the level of activity reduction in the STN or GPi. Method: The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) is used to build a model of syllable sequencing through a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex circuit. The model is able to simulate a failing substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), as occurs in Parkinsons patients. We simulate syllable sequencing parameterized by (i) the tonic dopamine level in the striatum and (ii) average neural activity in STN or GPi. Results: With decreased dopamine levels, the model produces syllable sequencing errors in the form of skipping and swapping syllables, repeating the same syllable, breaking and restarting in the middle of a sequence, and cessation (freezing) of sequences. We also find that reducing (inhibiting) activity in either STN or GPi reduces the occurrence of syllable sequencing errors. Conclusion: The model predicts that inhibiting activity in STN or GPi can reduce syllable sequencing errors in Parkinsons patients. Since DBS also reduces syllable sequencing errors in Parkinsons patients, we therefore suggest that STNor GPi inhibition is one mechanismthrough which DBS reduces syllable sequencing errors in Parkinsons patients. © 2018 Senft, Stewart, Bekolay, Eliasmith and Kröger.",Basal ganglia; Deep brain stimulation; Neural engineering framework; Parkinsons disease; Speech; Speech disorders,Amines; Brain; Drug therapy; Errors; Neurons; Speech; Basal ganglia; Deep brain stimulation; Neural engineering; Parkinson; Speech disorders; Neurosurgery; dopamine; Article; basal ganglion; computer simulation; controlled study; cortico basal ganglia thalamus cortex circuit; dopamine brain level; dopaminergic activity; electroencephalogram; error; globus pallidus; globus pallidus internus; nerve conduction; nerve tract; nonbiological model; Parkinson disease; qualitative analysis; repetition error; speech analysis; substantia nigra pars compacta; subthalamic nucleus; syllable sequencing error; syllable sequencing model,,Frontiers Media S.A.,16625188,,,,English,Front.

The fractal dimensions are calculated, the theoretical and the calculated values are compared with paired samples. And the results are compared by non-parametric test. The result shows that power spectral density method has good characterization effect on fractal simulation contour curve.

Although a vast number of studies have been conducted to join Al to steel, the joining of Al to steel is still challenging due to the formation of brittle Fe-Al intermetallic compounds. In this work, the microstructure and mechanical properties of the dissimilar Al/steel joints with and without a nickel coating are comparatively investigated. A homogenous reaction layer composed of FeZn 10 and Fe 2 A l5 is formed at the interface in the joints without Ni coating, and the joint facture load is only 743 N. To prevent the formation of brittle Fe 2 A l5 , Ni electroplated coating is applied onto a steel surface. It has been shown that a nonhomogeneous reaction layer is observed at the interfacial region: Ni 5 Zn 21 is formed at the direct irradiation zone, while Al 3 Ni is formed at the fusion zone root. The microhardness of the interfacial layer is reduced, which leads to the improvement of the joint mechanical properties. The average fracture load of the Al/Ni-coated steel joints reaches 930 N. In all of the cases, failure occurs at the Ni coating/fusion zone interface. © 2018 by the authors.",Aluminum alloy; Interfacial microstructure; Intermetallic compounds; Laser welding/brazing; Mechanical properties; Ni coating,,,MDPI AG,20763417,,,,English,Appl.

Advances in natural language processing have made it possible to extract information from large scale unstructured data like nursing notes. This study extracted the sentimentimpressions and attitudesof nurses, and examined how sentiment relates to 30-day mortality and survival. Methods This study applied a sentiment analysis algorithm to nursing notes extracted from MIMIC-III, a public intensive care unit (ICU) database. A multiple logistic regression model was fitted to the data to correlate measured sentiment with 30-day mortality while controlling for gender, type of ICU, and SAPS-II score. The association between measured sentiment and 30-day mortality was further examined in assessing the predictive performance of sentiment score as a feature in a classifier, and in a survival analysis for different levels of measured sentiment. Results Nursing notes from 27,477 ICU patients, with an overall 30-day mortality of 11.02%, were extracted. In the presence of known predictors of 30-day mortality, mean sentiment polarity was a highly significant predictor in a multiple logistic regression model (Adjusted OR = 0.4626, p < 0.001, 95% CI: [0.4244, 0.5041]) and led to improved predictive accuracy (AUROC = 0.8189 versus 0.8092, 95% BCI of difference: [0.0070, 0.0126]). The Kaplan Meier survival curves showed that mean sentiment polarity quartiles are positively correlated with patient survival (log-rank test: p < 0.001). Conclusions This study showed that quantitative measures of unstructured clinical notes, such as sentiment of clinicians, correlate with 30-day mortality and survival, thus can also serve as a predictor of patient outcomes in the ICU. Therefore, further research is warranted to study and make use of the wealth of data that clinical notes have to offer. © 2018 Waudby-Smith et al.

These models allow for software-in-the-loop (SIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing, where the battery pack is simulated in software. However, development of these battery models can be time-consuming, especially when trying to model the effects of temperature and SOC on the equivalent circuit model (ECM) parameters. Estimation of this relationship is often accomplished by carrying out many experiments, which can be costly and time consuming for BMS manufacturers. To address these issues, this paper makes two contributions to literature. First, a comprehensive battery model is developed, where the ECM parameter surface is generated using a design of experiments (DOE) approach. Second, replication runs are conducted to accurately estimate the measurement noise and determine which model parameters are significant. The technique is then compared with existing approaches from the literature, and it is shown that, by using the proposed method, the same degree of accuracy can be obtained while requiring significantly fewer experimental runs. This can be advantageous for BMS manufacturers that require a high-fidelity model but cannot afford to carry out many experiments. © 2018 by the authors.

Although emerging evidence indicates that quit smoking apps are an effective way to reduce smoking among young adults, lacking is formative evaluative research that captures the perspectives of end-users. Objective: The objective of this study was to contribute insights toward understanding how young adults interact with the Crush the Crave (CTC) app, and how this interaction shapes young adults smoking cessation experiences and practices, with consideration of the influence of gender. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 31 young adult CTC end-users. Guided by sociomateriality theory and an affordances approach, data were inductively analyzed to derive thematic findings in relation to the impacts of CTC on quit efforts, and to expose the underlying affordances (mechanisms) that lend to these outcomes. Findings were grouped according to the 4 design components of CTC: credibility, social support, task support, and dialogue support. Results: The credibility component of CTC played an important role in harnessing the trust of young adults because it afforded them promise in relation to its potential effectiveness in assisting them with quitting smoking. The social support component lent to various end-user practices and experiences that rendered this aspect as the weakest component in supporting quit efforts. Although most functions situated in the task and dialogue support components were found to be helpful, there were a few affordances in CTC that resulted in negative experiences, notably weaning from smoking. Gender-related influences were also evident. For example, young men preferred to control and self-manage their quitting and, therefore, did not engage with functions that afforded journaling or reminding to stay on track. Women, in contrast, were more likely to benefit from these affordances. Conclusions: An affordances approach is productive for gaining an in-depth understanding of how mobile apps interact with end-users to lend to particular outcomes. The study findings have implications for developing and improving apps for helping young adults quit smoking, as well as apps that target other health behaviors.

In doing so, we address a knowledge gap about the maintenance and replication of governance processes that support transformative change, with a particular focus on small-scale fisheries that are facing ecological decline. Recent introduction of comanaged territorial use rights for small-scale fishers in the Cau Hai Lagoon, Vietnam has shown promise for alleviating ecological impacts from overfishing and reduced conflicts among fishers. We use this setting to inductively identify building blocks in two case study sites, and highlight the lessons for replicating successes in similar small-scale coastal fisheries. The investigation revealed five building blocks that were instrumental to success in the two case study communities: fisher approval of ecological conservation, cooperation among fishers, support from local government, secure funding, and effective leadership. These findings demonstrate site-level specificity of what governance attributes are already contributing to more durable and transformative change, and how these attributes can be augmented in other communities in the Cau Hai Lagoon. Key lessons for governance of transformations are that (1) building blocks do not need to be identical from case to case, and (2) further consideration needs to be given to how building blocks may nest or fit together. Our research contributes to a relatively new body of literature on deliberative transformations and offers guidance on a way to support and enhance transformations of small-scale fisheries. © 2018 by the author(s).",Deliberative transformations; Small-scale fisheries; Territorial use rights for fishers; Transformation pathways,coastal lagoon; comanagement; ecological impact; fishery management; governance approach; overfishing; territorial management; Cau Hai Lagoon; Viet Nam,,Resilience Alliance,17083087,,,,English,Ecol.

Although there is no universal definition for battery SOH, it is often defined based on the increase in the battery's internal resistance. Techniques such as extended Kalman filter (EKF) and recursive least squares (RLS) are two frequently used approaches for online estimation of this resistance. These two methods can, however, be computationally expensive, especially in the case of a battery pack composed of hundreds of cells. In addition, both methods require a battery model as well as chemistry specific parameters. Therefore, this paper investigates the performance of a direct resistance estimation (DRE) technique that requires minimal computational resources and can be implemented without any training data. This approach estimates the ohmic resistance only when the battery experiences sharp pulses in current. Comparison of results from the three algorithms shows that the DRE algorithm can accurately identify a degraded cell under various operating conditions while significantly reducing the required computational complexity. The findings will further advance diagnostic techniques for the identification of a weak cell in a large battery pack. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Fundamental to any landscape conservation efforts is the identification of priority habitats to help target management efforts. Many avian species associated with prairie ecosystems have experienced population declines along with continued loss of prairie habitats. Additionally, given the long history of research in avian systems and the close grassland associations of some species, birds are excellent candidate taxa for the identification of priority habitats and can provide an informed starting point for multispecies assessments. We used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (1997-2014) to develop species distribution models for 15 grassland bird species across the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada. Model performance varied widely across species. Ten species demonstrated good model performance (average Boyce Index > 0.64 across 5-fold cross validation). We used these 10 species to assess the influence of habitat covariates on the relative probability of occurrence, to compare the spatial scales of selection, and to generate multispecies habitat priority maps. Of the nine habitat covariates considered, most species predictably demonstrated positive associations with grassland habitats and avoidance of areas of high tree and shrub cover. Two covariates representing wetland abundance were also frequently included in the top models. The area covered by wetlands (w.area) was present in the top model for 5 of 10 species with a consistently estimated negative coefficient. However, a covariate, which represented the number of wetland basins (w.basins), was present in the top model for 8 of 10 species with an estimated positive coefficient for all but 1 species, representing a preference for more heterogeneous wetland landscapes. The larger spatial scales we considered tended to have greater explanatory power than smaller spatial scales and were thus more prevalent in the top models. The multispecies priority habitat maps that we produced can be used for future assessments of potential habitat management actions. Our work provides a critical foundation for the incorporation of grassland bird conservation goals into on-going landscape-planning initiatives in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada. © 2018 by the author(s).",Ecology; Grassland birds; Prairie; SDM; Species distribution models; Wildlife,,,Resilience Alliance,17126568,,,,English,Avian Conserv.

In order to apply the CA approach, we introduce an action principle for the null fluid which sources the Vaidya geometries, and we carefully examine the contribution of the null shell to the action. Further, we find that adding a particular counterterm on the null boundaries of the Wheeler-DeWitt patch is essential if the gravitational action is to properly describe the complexity of the boundary state. For both the CV proposal and the CA proposal (with the extra boundary counterterm), the late time limit of the growth rate of the holographic complexity for the one-sided black hole is precisely the same as that found for an eternal black hole. © 2018, The Author(s).",AdS-CFT Correspondence; Black Holes; Black Holes in String Theory; Gauge-gravity correspondence,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

This study provides an in-depth understanding of how relatively new multidisciplinary primary care settings may be affecting nutrition care practices of family physicians and nurse practitioners. This qualitative comparative case study sought to assess nutrition care practices in three different types of multidisciplinary clinics (2 Family Health Teams, 3 Community Health Centers, 1 Nurse Practitioner-Led Clinic) in Ontario, Canada. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with nurse practitioners (n = 13) and family physicians (n = 7) in fall 2017. Data analysis was conducted using NVivo Software. The integrated approach was used for elucidating codes and themes. Findings suggest that suboptimal duration of medical visits and increasing prevalence of complex patients were reported by most participants and were perceived as barriers for addressing nutrition and obesity. However, improved nutrition care was fostered through Electronic Medical Records, primary care providers' positive attitude towards nutrition and cost-free dietitian services at point of access.

While several studies have shown that AmED can have dangerous effects, less well understood is how AmED is associated with driving under the influence of either alcohol or drugs. This study sought to determine whether youth who use AmED were more likely to engage in driving, or being a passenger of a driver, under the influence of alcohol or cannabis compared to youth who use either alcohol or energy drinks alone. This study used data from grade 1012 students who took part in the 2014/2015 Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (N = 17,450). The association of past-year AmED use with past-30 day: driving under the influence of alcohol or cannabis, and riding with an alcohol- or cannabis-influenced driver, was assessed using logistic regression. One in four youth had consumed AmED in the previous 12 months. AmED users were more likely to engage in all risk behaviours except riding with a drinking driver, relative to youth who only consumed alcohol. No association was observed for youth who consumed alcohol and energy drinks on separate occasions. Youth who use AmED demonstrate a higher risk profile for driving under the influence of alcohol or cannabis, than youth who use alcohol alone. Future research should explore the biopsychosocial pathways that may explain why using energy drinks enhances the already heightened risk posed by alcohol on other health-related behaviours such as driving under the influence. © 2017 The Authors",Adolescents; Alcohol; Driving under the influence of alcohol; Driving under the influence of cannabis; Energy drinks; Road safety,alcohol; cannabis; alcohol consumption; Article; Canada; cannabis use; car driver; controlled study; drunken driving; energy drink; female; high risk behavior; high school student; human; male; priority journal,,Academic Press Inc.,917435,,PVTMA,29197535,English,Prev.

Conservation on these private lands, next to statutory protected areas, promises to play a critical role in efforts for reaching internationally agreed environmental protection targets. Lying at the heart of an emerging land system science, in which ecology, economics, geography, psychology, and other social sciences interact, private land conservation is reflecting the intertwined and multiscalar processes of our rapidly transforming world. Situated at this disciplinary meeting point, private land conservation invites a great breadth of approaches and cross-disciplinary work that offer deep insights into social and environmental change, often from surprising angles. Although many questions remain in private land conservation, we can now build on a large body of recent high-quality studies as we push this field forward in both research and practice. The Special Feature Private Land Conservation-Landowner Motives, Policies, and Outcomes of Conservation Measures in Unprotected Landscapes brings together contributions that explore the diversity of recent advances in private land conservation science. As an introduction to this Special Feature, first we are reviewing recent dynamics in important social-ecological drivers with bearing on private land conservation science. We go on to introduce the individual contributions to this Special Feature and then examine common themes as they are emerging from these papers, including the need for flexibility in conservation approaches, pursuit of community cobenefits of conservation, increasing consideration of environmental justice questions, and acknowledgment of the importance of social psychology in shaping private land conservation. We conclude with identification of knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research, as we advance from diagnostics to normative work in private land conservation science. © 2018 by the author(s).",Conservation; Environmental protection; Land management; Multidisciplinary; Policy; Practice; Private landowner; Social-ecological,,,Resilience Alliance,17083087,,,,English,Ecol.

The objective of this study was to systematically review and appraise the quality of cost-effectiveness or utility studies assessing eHealth technologies in study populations involving older adults. Methods: We systematically searched multiple databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, NHS EED, and PsycINFO) for peer-reviewed studies published in English from 2000 to 2016 that examined cost-effectiveness (or utility) of eHealth technologies. The reporting quality of included studies was appraised using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards statement. Results: Eleven full text articles met the inclusion criteria representing public and private health care systems. eHealth technologies evaluated by these studies includes computerized decision support system, a web-based physical activity intervention, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy, telecare, and telehealth. Overall, the reporting quality of the studies included in the review was varied. Most studies demonstrated efficacy and costeffectiveness of an intervention using a randomized control trial and statistical modeling, respectively. This review found limited information on the feasibility of adopting these technologies based on economic and organizational factors. Conclusions: This review identified few economic evaluations of eHealth technologies that included older adults. The quality of the current evidence is limited and further research is warranted to clearly demonstrate the long-term cost-effectiveness of eHealth technologies from the health care system and societal perspectives. © 2018 Sanyal et al.

Hence, half-hourly CO2 fluxes of an ombrotrophic peat bog in the Harz Mountains, Germany, were measured with the EC technique during a growing season with exceptionally dry weather spells. A common biophysical process model for net ecosystem exchange was used to describe measured CO2 fluxes and to fill data gaps. Model parameters and uncertainties were estimated by robust inverse modelling in a Bayesian framework using a population-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler. The focus of this study was on the correct statistical description of error, i.e. the differences between the measured and simulated carbon fluxes, and the influence of distributional assumptions on parameter estimates, cumulative carbon fluxes, and uncertainties. We tested the Gaussian, Laplace, and Student's t distribution as error models. The t-distribution was identified as best error model by the deviance information criterion. Its use led to markedly different parameter estimates, a reduction of parameter uncertainty by about 40%, and, most importantly, to a 5% higher estimated cumulative CO2 uptake as compared to the commonly assumed Gaussian error distribution. As open-path measurement systems have larger measurement error at high humidity, the standard deviation of the error was modeled as a function of measured vapor pressure deficit. Overall, this paper demonstrates the importance of critically assessing the influence of distributional assumptions on estimated model parameters and cumulative carbon fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere. © 2018.

The aim is to inform and improve capacity building interventions. Methods: Four strategies were used: 1) electronic database searching; 2) reference lists of included papers; 3) key informant consultation; and 4) grey literature searching. Inclusion (e.g., published in English) and exclusion criteria (e.g., non-English language papers published earlier than 2005) are outlined with included papers focusing on capacity building, learning plans, or professional development plans within public health and related settings, such as non-governmental organizations, government, or community-based organizations relating to public health or healthcare. Outcomes of interest included changes in knowledge, skill or confidence (self-efficacy), changes in practice (application or intent), and perceived support or supportive environments, with outcomes reported at the individual, organizational or systems level(s). Quality assessment of all included papers was completed. Results: Fourteen papers were included in this review. These papers reported on six intervention types: 1) internet-based instruction, 2) training and workshops, 3) technical assistance, 4) education using self-directed learning, 5) communities of practice, and 6) multi-strategy interventions. The available literature showed improvements in one or more capacity-building outcomes of interest, mainly in terms of individual-level outcomes. The available literature was moderate in quality and showed a range of methodological issues. Conclusions: There is evidence to inform capacity building programming and how interventions can be selected to optimize impact. Organizations should carefully consider methods for analysis of capacity building interventions offered; specifically, through which mechanisms, to whom, and for which purpose. Capacity-building interventions can enhance knowledge, skill, self-efficacy (including confidence), changes in practice or policies, behaviour change, application, and system-level capacity. However in applying available evidence, organizations should consider the outcomes of highest priority, selecting intervention(s) effective for the outcome(s) of interest. Examples are given for selecting intervention(s) to match priorities and context, knowing effectiveness evidence is only one consideration in decision making. Future evaluations should: extend beyond the individual level, assess outcomes at organizational and systems levels, include objective measures of effect, assess baseline conditions, and evaluate features most critical to the success of interventions. © 2018 The Author(s).",Global Health; Health education/st [standards]; Health promotion/st [standards]; MeSH (7) capacity building; Professional competence/st [standards]; Public health; Total quality management/og [Organization & Administration],behavior change; capacity building; clinical assessment; comparative effectiveness; consultation; global health; government; health education; health promotion; human; human experiment; information retrieval; Internet; language; outcome assessment; professional competence; professional development; public health service; review; self-directed learning; skill; systematic review; total quality management,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712458,,,29859075,English,BMC Public Health,Review,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047907215,

Ranking allows scarce resources to be guided toward nodes integral to connectivity. The greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a species of conservation concern that breeds on spatially discrete leks that must remain connected by genetic exchange for population persistence. We genotyped 5,950 individuals from 1,200 greater sage-grouse leks distributed across the entire species geographic range. We found a small-world network composed of 458 nodes connected by 14,481 edges. This network was composed of hubsthat is, nodes facilitating gene flow across the networkand spokesthat is, nodes where connectivity is served by hubs. It is within these hubs that the greatest genetic diversity was housed. Using indices of network centrality, we identified hub nodes of greatest conservation importance. We also identified keystone nodes with elevated centrality despite low local population size. Hub and keystone nodes were found across the entire species contiguous range, although nodes with elevated importance to network-wide connectivity were found more central: especially in northeastern, central, and southwestern Wyoming and eastern Idaho. Nodes among which genes are most readily exchanged were mostly located in Montana and northern Wyoming, as well as Utah and eastern Nevada. The loss of hub or keystone nodes could lead to the disintegration of the network into smaller, isolated subnetworks. Protecting both hub nodes and keystone nodes will conserve genetic diversity and should maintain network connections to ensure a resilient and viable population over time.

In a subhumid climate, hydrogeological position is an important control on peatland hydrology and wildfire vulnerability. Consequently, we hypothesized that in a coarse-textured glaciofluvial outwash, isolated peatlands lacking the moderating effect of large-scale groundwater flow would have greater water table (WT) variability and would also be more vulnerable to deep WT drawdown and wildfire during dry climate cycles. A holistic approach was taken to evaluate 3 well-accepted factors that are associated with smouldering in boreal peatlands: hollow microform coverage, peatland margin morphometry, and gravimetric water content. Using a combination of field measurements (bulk density, humification, WT position, hummockhollow distribution, and margin width) and modelling (1-D vertical unsaturated flow coupled with a simple peatfuel energy balance equation), we assessed the vulnerability of peat to smouldering. We found that a peatland in the regionally intermediate topographic position is the most vulnerable to smouldering due to the interaction of variable connectivity to large-scale groundwater flow and the absence of mineral stratigraphy for limiting WT declines during dry conditions. Our findings represent a novel assessment framework and tool for fire managers by providing a priori knowledge of potential peat smouldering hot spot locations in the landscape to efficiently allocate resources and reduce emergency response time to smouldering events. © 2018 The Authors.

We proposed that two capacities will be essential to transformation: the capacity to navigate emergence and cross-scale systems reflexivity. We outline our efforts to design and deliver a Global Fellowship program in social innovation, intended to strengthen these two capacities among practitioners already engaged in socially innovative work. Results indicated that the concepts, frameworks, and experiences introduced through the Fellowship led to four key insights about these capacities. Firstly, individual Fellows and their organizations were able to see some complex system dynamics that were previously invisible, which in turn, allowed Fellows to see the distribution of resources and agency across the system in new ways. Secondly, engaging with diversity is essential in social innovation and transformative change processes, and system reflexivity aided in doing this. Additionally, Fellows indicated they were able to identify different kinds of opportunities and the generative potential that can lie within social-ecological systems. Lastly, the findings demonstrate the challenging nature of crossing scales and how a transformative space, such as a Fellowship, helps to practice the experience of contestation, unpredictability, and the uncontrollable dynamics of transformation and social innovation. © 2018 by the author(s).",Complex systems; Emergence; Fellowship; Institutional work; Resilience; Social innovation; Systems change; Systems entrepreneurship; Systems reflexivity; Transformations to sustainability; Transformative capacities; Transformative spaces,complexity; entrepreneur; innovation; institutional framework; learning; social development; social network; sustainability,,Resilience Alliance,17083087,,,,English,Ecol.

Methods: One thousand and four (792 urban and 193 rural) support persons of adults diagnosed with haematological cancer were recruited from five Australian state population-based cancer registries. Participants completed the Support Person Unmet Needs Survey (SPUNS) that assessed the level of unmet needs experienced over the past month across six domains. Results: Overall, 66% of support persons had at least one moderate, high or very high unmet need and 24% (n = 182) reported having multiple (i.e. 6 or more) high/very high unmet needs in the past month. There were no significant differences between rural and urban support persons in the prevalence of multiple unmet needs or mean total unmet needs scores. There were however significant differences in the types of high/very high unmet needs with support persons living in rural areas more likely to report finance-related unmet needs. Support persons who indicated they had difficulty paying bills had significantly higher odds of reporting multiple high/very high unmet needs. Conclusions: This is the first large, population-based study to compare the unmet needs of support persons of haematological cancer survivors living in rural and urban areas. Findings confirm previous evidence that supporting a person diagnosed with haematological cancer correlates with a high level of unmet needs and highlight the importance of developing systemic strategies for assisting support persons, especially in regard to making financial assistance and travel subsidies known and readily accessible to those living in rural areas. © 2018, The Author(s).",Haematological; Informal care givers; Supportive care; Unmet needs,adolescent; adult; aged; Article; Australia; cancer registry; cancer survival; cancer survivor; clinical assessment; comparative study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; female; financial management; health care need; hematologic malignancy; hospital billing; human; leukemia; major clinical study; male; middle aged; myeloma; nonhodgkin lymphoma; prevalence; priority journal; psychological well-being; rural area; social support; urban area; very elderly; epidemiology; hematologic disease; mortality; pathology; questionnaire; rural population; survivor; urban population; Australia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hematologic Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires; Survivors; Urban Population,,Springer Verlag,9414355,,SCCAE,29313130,English,Supportive Care Cancer,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046000348,

Gait performance is an accepted indicator of global health and it has been proposed as a valid motor marker to detect older adults at risk of developing mobility and cognitive declines including future falls and incident dementia. Our goal was to provide a gait assessment protocol to be used for clinical and research purposes. Methods Based on a consensus that identified common evaluations to assess motorcognitive interactions in community-dwelling older individuals, a protocol on how to evaluate gait in older adults for the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) was developed.Results The CCNA gait assessment includes preferred and fast pace gait, and dual-task gait that comprises walking while performing three cognitively demanding tasks: counting backwards by ones, counting backwards by sevens, and naming animals. This gait protocol can be implemented using an electronic-walkway, as well as by using a regular stopwatch. The latter approach provides a simple manner to evaluate quantitative gait performance in clinics. Conclusions Establishing a standardized gait assessment protocol will help to assess motorcognitive interactions in aging and neurode-generation, to compare results across studies, and to feasibly implement and translate gait testing in clinics for detecting impending cognitive and mobility decline. © 2018 Author(s).",Aging; Cognition; Consensus; Gait; Neurodegenerative diseases,,,Canadian Geriatrics Society,19258348,,,,English,Canadian Geriatrics J.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049917673,

Starting with the premise that an understanding of fisheries' interactions with these external sectors is in itself critical for achieving sustainability of the fisheries, this paper explores the topic of intersectoral governance and outlines an approach to analyzing the intricate and often challenging sector relationships. By drawing on examples of inland fisheries from around the world, the paper proposes four broad discursive mechanisms that can structure the study of the intersectoral dynamics, i.e., system characterization, valuation, power relations, and vertical policy interaction. A synthesis model then demonstrates their interwoven nature, revealing the way each mechanism influences one another as together they shape overall outcomes. It is apparent that analyses often need to be combined to advance more rigorous (and transdisciplinary) science and also inform appropriate courses for the governance of inland fisheries. Given the typically marginal position of fisheries in inland water-use discussions, we call for a more systematic understanding of intersectoral interactions to enhance the sector's resilience within the wider society and subsequently contribute to integrated governance of waterbodies. © 2018 by the author(s).",Cross-sectoral relationships; Inland fisheries; Integrative environmental governance; Valuation; Water-energy-food nexus,environmental management; fishery management; human activity; inland fishery; sustainability; valuation; water use,,Resilience Alliance,17083087,,,,English,Ecol.

Some speculative theories suggest that quantum correlations, such as entanglement, may exhibit different behavior to purely classical correlations in curved space. By measuring this effect or lack thereof, we can test the hypotheses behind several such models. For instance, as predicted by Ralph et al [5] and Ralph and Pienaar [1], a bipartite entangled system could decohere if each particle traversed through a different gravitational field gradient. We propose to study this effect in a ground to space uplink scenario. We extend the above theoretical predictions of Ralph and coworkers and discuss the scientific consequences of detecting/failing to detect the predicted gravitational decoherence. We present a detailed mission design of the European Space Agency's Space QUEST (Space - Quantum Entanglement Space Test) mission, and study the feasibility of the mission scheme. © 2018 The Author(s).

The survey covers the whole Virgo cluster region from its core to one virial radius (104 deg 2 ). The sensitivity of the survey is of f(H?) ? 4 × 10 -17 erg s -1 cm -2 (5? detection limit) for point sources and ?(H?) ? 2 × 10 -18 erg s -1 cm -2 arcsec -2 (1? detection limit at 3 arcsec resolution) for extended sources, making VESTIGE the deepest and largest blind NB survey of a nearby cluster. This paper presents the survey in all its technical aspects, including the survey design, the observing strategy, the achieved sensitivity in both the NB H?+[NII] and in the broad-band r filter used for the stellar continuum subtraction, the data reduction, calibration, and products, as well as its status after the first observing semester. We briefly describe the H? properties of galaxies located in a 4 × 1 deg 2 strip in the core of the cluster north of M87, where several extended tails of ionised gas are detected. This paper also lists the main scientific motivations for VESTIGE, which include the study of the effects of the environment on galaxy evolution, the fate of the stripped gas in cluster objects, the star formation process in nearby galaxies of different type and stellar mass, the determination of the H? luminosity function and of the H? scaling relations down to ?10 6 M ? stellar mass objects, and the reconstruction of the dynamical structure of the Virgo cluster. This unique set of data will also be used to study the HII luminosity function in hundreds of galaxies, the diffuse H?+[NII] emission of the Milky Way at high Galactic latitude, and the properties of emission line galaxies at high redshift. © ESO 2018.",Galaxies: clusters: general; Galaxies: clusters: individual: Virgo; Galaxies: evolution; Galaxies: interactions; Galaxies: ISM,Gas emissions; Ionization; Luminance; Product design; Stars; Surveys; Galaxies: clusters: General; Galaxies: clusters: individual: Virgo; Galaxies: evolutions; Galaxies: interactions; Galaxies: ISM; Galaxies,,EDP Sciences,46361,,AAEJA,,English,Astron.

The X-ray spectra in the 0.8-80 keV range obtained with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS), Soft X-ray Imager, and Hard X-ray Imager (HXI) show a significant break in the continuum as previously found with the NuSTAR observation. After taking into account all known emissions from the SNR other than the PWN itself, we find that the Hitomi spectra can be fitted with a broken power law with photon indices of 1 = 1.74 ± 0.02 and 2 = 2.14 ± 0.01 below and above the break at 7.1 ± 0.3 keV, which is significantly lower than the NuSTAR result (?9.0 keV). The spectral break cannot be reproduced by time-dependent particle injection one-zone spectral energy distribution models, which strongly indicates that a more complex emission model is needed, as suggested by recent theoretical models. We also search for narrow emission or absorption lines with the SXS, and perform a timing analysis of PSR J1833-1034 with the HXI and the Soft Gamma-ray Detector. No significant pulsation is found from the pulsar. However, unexpectedly, narrow absorption line features are detected in the SXS data at 4.2345 keV and 9.296 keV with a significance of 3.65 s. While the origin of these features is not understood, their mere detection opens up a new field of research and was only possible with the high resolution, sensitivity, and ability to measure extended sources provided by an X-ray microcalorimeter. © 2018 The Author(s).",ISM: individual objects(G21.5-0.9); ISM: supernovaremnants; pulsars: individual(PSR J1833-1034),,,Oxford University Press,46264,,,,English,Publ.

Using such a material as a dopant in increasingly higher concentrations is found to lead to an increase in device stability, a trend that is different from that commonly observed with conventional OLED guests. The results are consistent with the newly discovered exciton-polaron-induced aggregation degradation mechanism of OLED materials. When this emitter is used as a neat emission layer, the material is already in a highly aggregated state, and the device is no longer affected by exciton-polaron interactions.

It involves sensing and integration of these biophysical cues into their transcriptome with a mechanism that is yet to be discovered. In addition to the cytoskeletal and focal adhesion remodeling, nanotopography has also been shown to modulate nucleus morphology. Here, we studied the effect of nanotopography on the temporal changes in nuclei of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Using a high throughput Multi-architecture (MARC) chip analysis, the circularity of the stem cell nuclei changed significantly on different patterns. Human ESCs and MSCs showed different temporal changes in nucleus morphology, lamin A/C expression and histone methylation during topography-induced neuronal differentiation. In hESCs, the expression of nuclear matrix protein, lamin A/C during neuronal differentiation of hESCs on PDMS samples were weakly detected in the first 7 days of differentiation. The histone 3 trimethylation on Lysine 9 (H3K9me3) decreased after differentiation initiated and showed temporal changes in their expression and organization during neuronal differentiation. In hMSCs, the expression of lamin A/C was significantly increased after the first 24 h of cell culture. The quantitative analysis of histone methylation also showed a significant increase in hMSCs histone methylation on 250 nm anisotropic nanogratings within the first 24 h of seeding. This reiterates the importance of cell-substrate sensing within the first 24 h for adult stem cells. The lamin A/C expression and histone methylation shows a correlation of epigenetic changes in early events of differentiation, giving an insight on how extracellular nanotopographical cues are transduced into nuclear biochemical signals. Collectively, these results provide more understanding into the nuclear regulation of the mechanotransduction of nanotopographical cues in stem cell differentiation. © 2018 Ankam, Teo, Pohan, Ho, Lim and Yim.",Embryonic stem cells; Epigenetics; Mechanotransduction; Mesenchymal stem cells; Neuronal differentiation; Nuclear changes; Nucleus,Alkylation; Amino acids; Cell culture; Methylation; Morphology; Nanotechnology; Neurons; Embryonic stem cells; Epigenetics; Mechanotransduction; Mesenchymal stem cell; Neuronal differentiation; Nuclear changes; Nucleus; Stem cells,,Frontiers Media S.A.,22964185,,,,English,Front.

The fully reverse four-point rotating-bending fatigue tests were conducted on the coated and uncoated samples in different environmental conditions. It is seen that the cold sprayed AA7075 improved the yield strength of the AZ31B cast alloy. Similarly, a significant fatigue enchantment was observed in the coated samples, reaching a fatigue strength of 90 MPa compared to as-cast fatigue strength of 70 MPa at 107 cycles when tested in air, and fatigue strength of 80 MPa under a 3.5%NaCl testing environment. The SEM analysis at the interface of the tensile tested sample exhibited the interfacial fracture followed by delamination of the coating. Similarly, delamination of coating was merely detected in the fatigue fracture sample tested in the air, while the sample tested in the corrosive environment showed pits which allowed the solution to penetrate in the AZ31B substrate results delamination and premature failure. However, the presence of e-paint forms a passive layer which is hindering the pit formation and extending the fatigue life. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,Bending tests; Coatings; Delamination; Fatigue testing; Fracture; High strength alloys; Magnesium alloys; Sodium chloride; Surface treatment; Zinc compounds; Cold spray process; Corrosive environment; Electrostatic painting; Environmental conditions; Interfacial fracture; Premature failures; Rotating bending fatigue tests; Testing environment; Corrosion fatigue,Henaff G.,EDP Sciences,2261236X,,,,English,MATEC Web Conf.,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048066749,

As-cast ZK60 billets were forged at a ram speed of 20 mm/sec and a temperature of 250 °C. While the yield strength of the starting alloy was 139 MPa, the forging process improved the yield strength significantly by ?68% to 234 MPa. Moreover, the stresscontrolled push-pull fatigue tests at the stress amplitudes of 140 MPa to 180 MPa revealed that the fatigue life was enhanced by an order of magnitude.

As a specific example, we investigate thin films of nearest-neighbor spin ice, using a combination of analytic large-N techniques and Monte Carlo simulations. In the simplest film geometry, with surfaces perpendicular to the [001] crystallographic direction, we observe pinch points in the spin-spin correlations characteristic of a two-dimensional Coulomb phase. We then consider the consequences of crystal symmetry breaking on the surfaces of the film through the inclusion of orphan bonds. We find that when these bonds are ferromagnetic, the Coulomb phase is destroyed by the presence of fluctuating surface magnetic charges, leading to a classical Z2 spin liquid. Building on this understanding, we discuss other film geometries with surfaces perpendicular to the [110] or the [111] direction. We generically predict the appearance of surface magnetic charges and discuss their implications for the physics of such films, including the possibility of an unusual Z3 classical spin liquid. Finally, we comment on open questions and promising avenues for future research. © 2018 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.

Conjecturally quantum-resistant, SIDH has the feature that it shares the same data flow as ordinary Diffie-Hellman: two parties exchange a pair of public keys, each generated from a private key, and combine them to form a shared secret. To create a potentially quantum-resistant scheme, SIDH depends on a new family of computational assumptions involving isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves which replace both the discrete logarithm problem and the computational and decisional Diffie- Hellman problems. As in the case of ordinary Diffie-Hellman, one is interested in knowing if these problems are related. In fact, more is true: there is a rich network of reductions between the isogeny problems securing the private keys of the participants in the SIDH protocol, the computational and decisional SIDH problems, and the problem of validating SIDH public keys. In this article we explain these relationships, which do not appear elsewhere in the literature, in hopes of providing a clearer picture of the SIDH problem landscape to the cryptography community at large. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Equivalence theorems; Isogeny-based cryptography; Post-quantum cryptography; SIDH; Supersingular elliptic curves; Torsion points,Chromium compounds; Geometry; Network security; Public key cryptography; Quantum cryptography; Computational assumptions; Decisional diffie-hellman problems; Diffie-Hellman protocol; Discrete logarithm problems; Equivalence theorem; Post quantum cryptography; SIDH; Supersingular elliptic curve; Computation theory,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9.78145E+12,,,English,"APKC - Proc.

Because of the noncommutative nature of quantum mechanics, the training process of the quantum Boltzmann machine (QBM) can become nontrivial. We circumvent the problem by introducing bounds on the quantum probabilities. This allows us to train the QBM efficiently by sampling. We show examples of QBM training with and without the bound, using exact diagonalization, and compare the results with classical Boltzmann training. We also discuss the possibility of using quantum annealing processors for QBM training and application. © 2018 authors.

In this paper, we provide an in-depth understanding of current nutrition-related weight management practices of primary care providers (PCPs) working in relatively new multidisciplinary health care settings in Ontario. Methods: Three types of multidisciplinary primary care settings were included (2 Family Health Teams, 3 Community Health Centres and 1 Nurse Practitioner-Led Clinic). Participants (n = 20) included in this study were nurse practitioners (n = 13) and family physicians (n = 7) supporting care for adult patients (18 years or older). In-depth interviews were transcribed, coded and the content was analyzed using an integrated approach. Results: Our analysis showed that most PCPs used anthropometric measures such as weight for screening patients who would benefit from nutrition counselling with a dietitian. The topic of nutrition was generally brought up either during physical examinations, when patients were diagnosed with a chronic disease, or when blood markers were out of normal range. Participants also mentioned that physical examinations are no longer occurring annually, with most PCPs offering episodic care. All participants reported utilizing dietetic referrals, noting the enablers for providing the referral, which included access to an on-site dietitian. Nonetheless, dietetic referrals were mostly used when patients had an obesity-related co-morbidity. Participants mentioned that healthy eating advice was reinforced during follow-up visits with patients only when there was enough time to do so. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) were utilized to facilitate message reinforcement by PCPs, who perceived EHRs to be helpful for viewing what was discussed in the session with the dietitian. Conclusions: PCPs mostly used objective measures to screen for patients who would benefit from nutrition counselling rather than diet assessment, which undermines the importance of dietary intake and overemphasizes weight. With physical examinations occurring less frequently, there will be additional missed opportunities for addressing nutrition-related concerns. The presence of a dietitian on site allowed for PCPs to refer patients to nutrition counselling. Having sufficient time during medical visits and EHRs seemed to facilitate message reinforcement by PCPs in follow-up visits with patients. © 2018 The Author(s).",Family medicine; Family physicians; Nurse practitioners; Nutrition; Obesity; Primary health care; Qualitative research; Weight management,,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712296,,,29788914,English,BMC Fam.

It employs the sociological theory of Bourdieu and Ingram to consider how parents experience non-vaccination as a valued form of capital in specific communities, and how this can affect their decision-making. Drawing on research conducted in two Australian cities, our qualitative analysis of new interview data shows that parents experience disjuncture and tugs towards appropriate forms of vaccination behavior in their social networks, as these link to broader behaviors around food, school choices and birth practices. We show how differences emerge between the two cities based on study designs, such that we are able to see some parents at the center of groups valorizing their decisions, whilst others feel marginalized within their communities for their decisions to vaccinate. We draw on the work of philosopher Mark Navin to consider how all parents join epistemic communities that reward compliance and conformity with the status quo and consider what this means for interventions that seek to influence the flow of pro-vaccine information through vaccine-critical social groups. © 2018 by the authors.

Here, we introduce a new quantity, the disjointness of the stabilizer code, which, roughly speaking, is the number of mostly nonoverlapping representations of any given nontrivial logical Pauli operator. The notion of disjointness proves useful in limiting transversal gates on any error-detecting stabilizer code to a finite level of the Clifford hierarchy. For code families, we can similarly restrict logical operators implemented by constant-depth circuits. For instance, we show that it is impossible, with a constant-depth but possibly geometrically nonlocal circuit, to implement a logical non-Clifford gate on the standard two-dimensional surface code. © 2018 authors.

The observations were performed in 2013 March using six VLBI stations in Hawaii, California, Arizona, and Chile. Compared to earlier observations, the addition of the APEX telescope in Chile almost doubles the longest baseline length in the array, provides additional uv coverage in the N-S direction, and leads to a spatial resolution of ?30 ?as (?3 Schwarzschild radii) for Sgr A?. The source is detected even at the longest baselines with visibility amplitudes of ?4%-13% of the total flux density. We argue that such flux densities cannot result from interstellar refractive scattering alone, but indicate the presence of compact intrinsic source structure on scales of ?3 Schwarzschild radii. The measured nonzero closure phases rule out point-symmetric emission. We discuss our results in the context of simple geometric models that capture the basic characteristics and brightness distributions of disk- and jet-dominated models and show that both can reproduce the observed data. Common to these models are the brightness asymmetry, the orientation, and characteristic sizes, which are comparable to the expected size of the black hole shadow. Future 1.3 mm VLBI observations with an expanded array and better sensitivity will allow more detailed imaging of the horizon-scale structure and bear the potential for a deep insight into the physical processes at the black hole boundary. © 2018.

Memory clinic (MC) teams in primary care settings have been established to provide care to people with ADRD. To consider wider adoption of these MC teams, insight is needed into the experiences of practitioners working in these models. The purpose of the current study is to explore the experiences of health care providers (HCPs) who work in primary care Memory Clinic (MC) teams to provide care to persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Methods: This study utilized a phenomenological methodology to explore experiences of 12 HCPs in two primary care MCs. Semi-structured interviews were completed with each HCP. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Colaizzi's steps for analyzing phenomenological data was utilized by the authors. Results: Three themes emerged from the analysis to describe HCP experiences: supporting patients and family members during ADRD diagnosis and treatment, working in a team setting, and personal and professional rewards of caring for people with ADRD and their family members. Conclusions: Findings provide insight into current practices in primary care MCs and on the motivation of HCPs working with persons with ADRD. © 2018 The Author(s).",Alzheimer's disease; Dementia; Gerontology; Memory clinics; Phenomenology; Primary health care; Qualitative methodology,,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712296,,,29778091,English,BMC Fam.

Their overall morphology was globular and rounded with a size distribution from about 20 to 200 ?m. Only the ATOMET 28 powder was characterized by a strong inhomogeneity of particle size and irregular polyhedral shape of powder particles with sharp edges. The powders were pre-sieved to a size distribution from 40 to 150 ?m before LENS processing. One particular sample-LENS-fabricated from the ATOMET 28 powder-was characterized by the largest cross-sectional (2D) porosity of 4.2% and bulk porosity of 3.9%, the latter determined by microtomography measurements. In contrast, the cross-sectional porosities of bulk, solid, nearly cubic LENS-fabricated samples from the other ATOMET powders exhibited very low porosities within the range 0.03-0.1%. Unexpectedly, the solid sample-LENS-fabricated from the reference, a purely spherical Fe 99.8 powder-exhibited a porosity of 1.1%, the second largest after that of the pre-sieved, nonspherical ATOMET 28 powder. Vibrations incorporated mechanically into the LENS powder feeding system substantially improved the flow rate vs. feeding rate dependence, making it completely linear with an excellent coefficient of fit, R2 = 0.99. In comparison, the reference powder Fe 99.8 always exhibited a linear dependence of the powder flow rate vs. feeding rate, regardless of vibrations. © 2018 by the authors.",Additive manufacturing; Globular powder; LENS technique; Water atomization,3D printers; Feeding; Particle size; Porosity; Size distribution; Laser engineered net shaping; Linear dependence; Micro-tomography; Powder feeding system; Powder flow rate; Powder particles; Water atomization; Water atomized iron powder; Powder metals,,MDPI AG,19961944,,,,English,Mater.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047129313,

The impact of radiation damage in particular regions or tissues on brain development as a whole has not been elucidated. Methods We delivered whole-brain or focal radiation (8 Gy single dose) to infant mice. Focal treatments targeted white matter (anterior commissure), neuronal (olfactory bulbs), or neurogenic (subventricular zone) regions. High-resolution ex vivo MRI was used to assess radiation-induced volume differences. Immunohistochemistry for myelin basic protein and doublecortin was performed to assess associated cellular changes within white matter and related to neurogenesis, respectively. Results Both whole-brain and focal RT in infancy resulted in volume deficits in young adulthood, with whole-brain RT resulting in the largest deficits. RT of the anterior commissure, surprisingly, showed no impact on its volume or on brain development as a whole. In contrast, RT of the olfactory bulbs resulted in off-target volume reduction in the anterior commissure and decreased subventricular zone neurogenesis. RT of the subventricular zone likewise produced volume deficits in both the olfactory bulbs and the anterior commissure. Similar off-target effects were found in the corpus callosum and parietal cortex. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that radiation damage locally can have important off-target consequences for brain development. These data suggest that WM may be less radiosensitive than volume change alone would indicate and have implications for region-sparing radiation treatments aimed at reducing cognitive late effects. © The Author(s) 2017.

While most cancer detection algorithms utilize either voxel-based or region-based feature models, the complexity of prostate tumour phenotype in MP-MRI requires a more sophisticated framework to better leverage available data and exploit a priori knowledge in the field. Methods: In this paper, we present MPCaD, a novel Multi-scale radiomics-driven framework for Prostate Cancer Detection and localization which leverages radiomic feature models at different scales as well as incorporates a priori knowledge of the field. Tumour candidate localization is first performed using a statistical texture distinctiveness strategy that leverages a voxel-resolution feature model to localize tumour candidate regions. Tumour region classification via a region-resolution feature model is then performed to identify tumour regions. Both voxel-resolution and region-resolution feature models are built upon and extracted from six different MP-MRI modalities. Finally, a conditional random field framework that is driven by voxel-resolution relative ADC features is used to further refine the localization of the tumour regions in the peripheral zone to improve the accuracy of the results. Results: The proposed framework is evaluated using clinical prostate MP-MRI data from 30 patients, and results demonstrate that the proposed framework exhibits enhanced separability of cancerous and healthy tissue, as well as outperforms individual quantitative radiomics models for prostate cancer detection. Conclusion: Quantitative radiomic features extracted from MP-MRI of prostate can be utilized to detect and localize prostate cancer. © 2018 The Author(s).",Computer-aided detection; Multi-parametric MRI; Prostate cancer,"algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; data mining; diagnostic imaging; early cancer diagnosis; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; prostate tumor; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Data Mining; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Prostatic Neoplasms; Sensitivity and Specificity",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712342,,BMIMA,29769042,English,BMC Med.

The Brewer-Dobson circulation is not well constrained by observations and further investigation is required to resolve uncertainties related to the mechanisms driving the circulation. This study has assessed the specified dynamics mode of the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM30) by comparing to the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) profile measurements of CFC-11 (CCl3F), CFC-12 (CCl2F2), and N2O. In the CMAM30 specified dynamics simulation, the meteorological fields are nudged using the ERA-Interim reanalysis and a specified tracer was employed for each species, with hemispherically defined surface measurements used as the boundary condition. A comprehensive sampling technique along the line of sight of the ACE-FTS measurements has been utilized to allow for direct comparisons between the simulated and measured tracer concentrations. The model consistently overpredicts tracer concentrations of CFC-11, CFC-12, and N2O in the lower stratosphere, particularly in the northern hemispheric winter and spring seasons. The three mixing barriers investigated, including the polar vortex, the extratropical tropopause, and the tropical pipe, show that there are significant inconsistencies between the measurements and the simulations.

Our platform measures a variety of iAQ metrics (CO 2 , HCHO, volatile organic compounds, NO 2 , O 3 , temperature, and relative humidity), can be flexibly powered by batteries or standard 5 W power supplies, and is connected to an infrastructure that supports an arbitrary number of nodes that push data to the cloud and record it in real-time. Some of the sensors used in our nodes generate data in standard units (like ppm or °C), and others provide an analog signal that cannot be directly converted into standard units. To increase the relative precision of measurements taken by different nodes, we placed all 6 pairs of the nodes used in our deployments in the same environment, recorded how they reacted to changing iAQ, and developed calibration functions to synchronize their signals. We deployed the comparatively cross-calibrated nodes to two different buildings on Princeton University's campus; a fabrication shop and an office building. In both buildings, we placed nodes at key positions in the ventilation supply chain, providing us with the ability to monitor where indoor air pollutants were being introduced, and when they tended to be introducedenabling us to monitor the evolution of pollutants temporally and spatially. We find that the occupied space of the first building's fabrication shop and the second building's open-plan office have higher levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) than outside air. This indicates that both buildings' ventilation systems are unable to supply enough fresh air to dilute VOCs generated inside those spaces. In the second building, we also find indications that other parameters are being driven by set-backs and occupancy. These first deployments demonstrate the ability of low-cost distributed iAQ sensor networks to help researchers identify where and when indoor air pollutants are introduced in buildings. © 2018 Coleman and Meggers.",Comparative calibration; Distributed sensing; Indoor Air Quality (IAQ); Internet of Things (IoT); Microcontrollers; Sensors; Ventilation; Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN),,,Frontiers Media S.A.,22973362,,,,English,Front.

The two black hole solutions present in the anti-de Sitter geometry have different mass and are compared to the data showing that the small black hole solution is in good agreement. This is a new feature in the literature since the small black hole in general relativity has different thermodynamic behavior from that of the large black hole solution. We find that the inclusion of the cosmological constant (which can be interpreted as the plasma pressure) leads to a lowering of the temperature of the freeze-out curve as a function of the baryochemical potential, improving the description previously suggested by Castorina, Kharzeev, and Satz. © 2018 The Authors",Anti de Sitter space; Black hole; Heavy-ion collisions; Thermalization,,,Elsevier B.V.,3702693,,PYLBA,,English,Phys Lett Sect B Nucl Elem Part High-Energy Phys,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042873551,

Based on the data collected through a citywide survey in 2015 and the map data of wet markets and supermarkets, the Poisson regression model was deployed to examine the correlations between geographical proximity to supermarkets and wet markets and household dietary diversity. The result shows that the coefficients for the distance to the nearest wet market are not statistically significant. Although the coefficients for the distance to nearest supermarket are statistically significant, they were too minor to reach a practical importance. We argue, however, that the insignificant correlations reflect exactly the high physical accessibility to food outlets and the extensive spatially dense food supply network constituted by wet markets, supermarkets and small food stores in Nanjing, due in part to the food infrastructure development planning in Nanjing that has ensured relatively equal and convenient access to wet markets or supermarkets for all households. Our findings are verified by the survey data that more than 90% of households purchased fresh food items within their neighborhoods or in walking distance. In addition to the densely distributed food outlets, various other factors contributed to the non-significant influence of the distance to the nearest wet market and supermarket, in particular, the numerous small food stores within or close to residential communities, the prevalence of three-generation extended household structure and the high household income. © 2018 by the author.",Dietary diversity; Food access; Food environment; Food geographies; Food security; Proximity to food outlets,food availability; food security; food supply; household income; household structure; neighborhood; supermarket; urban area; urban population; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu],,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046671285,

In these measurements, a small magnetic particle attached to the tip of a silicon cantilever is scanned over a micron-size superconducting ring fabricated from a thin aluminum film. We find that near the superconducting transition temperature of the aluminum, the dissipation and frequency of the cantilever changes significantly at particular locations where the tip-induced magnetic flux penetrating the ring causes the two lowest-energy fluxoid states to become nearly degenerate. In this regime, we show that changes in the cantilever frequency and dissipation are well-described by a stochastic resonance (SR) process, wherein small oscillations of the cantilever in the presence of thermally activated phase slips (TAPS) in the ring give rise to a dynamical force that modifies the mechanical properties of the cantilever. Using the SR model, we calculate the average fluctuation rate of the TAPS as a function of temperature over a 32-dB range in frequency, and we compare it to the Langer-Ambegaokar-McCumber-Halperin theory for TAPS in one-dimensional superconducting structures. © 2018 American Physical Society.",,,,American Physical Society,24699950,,,,English,Phys.

Methods: This was a double-masked, randomized, parallel-group study conducted in 14 clinical centers in Canada and Australia. Subjects with no more than mild dry eye instilled CMC-HA or CMC for 90 days post-LASIK. Ocular Surface Disease Index© (OSDI; primary efficacy measure), corneal staining, tear break-up time (TBUT), Schirmers test, acceptability/tolerability surveys, and visual acuity were assessed at screening and days 2, 10, 30, 60, and 90 post-surgery. Safety analyses included all enrolled. Results: A total of 148 subjects (CMC-HA, n=75; CMC, n=73) were enrolled and assigned to receive treatment, and 126 subjects completed the study without any protocol violations. Post-LASIK, dry eye signs/symptoms peaked at 10 days. OSDI scores for both groups returned to normal with no differences between treatment groups at day 90 (P=0.775). Corneal staining, Schirmers test, TBUT, and survey results were comparable. Higher mean improvements in uncorrected visual acuity were observed in the CMC-HA group at all study visits, reaching statistical significance at day 30 (P=0.013). Both treatments were well tolerated. Conclusion: CMC-HA-containing artificial tears relieved post-LASIK ocular dryness as well as CMC alone, and demonstrated incremental benefit in uncorrected vision, with a favorable safety profile. Results support use of CMC-HA eye drops to reduce signs and symptoms of ocular dryness post-LASIK. © 2018 Schafer et al.",Artificial tears; Carboxymethylcellulose; Dry eye; Hyaluronic acid; LASIK; Ocular surface disease,artificial tear; carboxymethylcellulose; hyaluronic acid; adult; Article; comparative study; controlled study; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug safety; drug tolerability; dry eye; female; human; keratomileusis; major clinical study; male; Ocular Surface Disease Index; postoperative period; randomized controlled trial; visual acuity,,Dove Medical Press Ltd,11775467,,,,English,Clin.

We use a CO2 laser to perform the standard ablative techniques of cutting and engraving materials, but we also apply a method that we call laser placement. This allows us to fabricate precisely-positioned and precisely-sized, isolated diaphragms. This in turn enables the rapid prototyping of integrated multilayer microfluidic devices to form complex structures without the need for manual positioning or cleanroom equipment. The fabrication process is also remarkably rapid and capable of being scaled to manufacturing levels of production. We explore the use of these devices to construct a compact system of peristaltic pumps that can form water in oil droplets without the use of the non-pulsatile pumping systems typically required. Many devices can be fabricated at a time on a sheet by sheet basis with a fabrication process that, to our knowledge, is the fastest reported to date for devices of this type (requiring only 3 h).

They assembled at a camp south of Victory Point on the northwest coast of King William Island and made the final preparations for the next step, a 400 km trek along the frozen seashores of King William Island and Adelaide Peninsula to the Back River. All of the men died before reaching their destination, and their remains have been found at 35 locations along the route of the retreat. These discoveries have played a central role in reenactments of events thought to have occurred during the failed attempt to reach the Back River and to the disastrous outcome of the expedition. This paper presents a summary of these findings and examines the criteria used to attribute them to the Franklin expedition.

In children and youth, experience of any chronic physical illness leads to a substantial increase in risk for mental illness. As a growing field of interest, research is needed to map the current state of the literature in child and youth multimorbidity in order to identify existing gaps and inform the direction of future investigations. Methods and analysis We are proposing the conduct of a scoping review to explore the depth and breadth of existing evidence in the field of child and youth multimorbidity. The scoping review will follow the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley, and will incorporate additional scoping review recommendations made by Levac et al. A systematic search of the following four key databases will be conducted: (1) PubMed; (2) EMBASE; (3) PsycINFO; and (4) Scopus, using combinations of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Emtree terms. We will also consult grey literature sources and hand-search reference lists of included studies to identify additional studies of relevance. For eligible studies that meet all identified inclusion and exclusion criteria, a data extraction tool will be used to collect and store key study characteristics that will be relevant for collating, summarising and reporting the results of the scoping review. This scoping review also presents a novel use of quality index scoring, which we anticipate will contribute to strengthening the rigour of the scoping review methodology. Ethics and dissemination The proposed scoping review does not require ethical approval. Final study results will be disseminated via conference presentations, publication in a peer-reviewed journal and knowledge translation activities with relevant stakeholders. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.",mental health; public health,child; childhood disease; consultation; Embase; Emtree; human; internal validity; medical information; Medical Subject Headings; Medline; meta analysis; multiple chronic conditions; PsycINFO; quality control; Review; Scopus; systematic review,,BMJ Publishing Group,20446055,,,29794105,English,BMJ Open,Review,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053119715,

Longitudinal data are needed to explore the pathway between e-cigarette and cigarette use, particularly among different risk groups including susceptible and non-susceptible never-smokers. The objective of this study was to examine whether baseline use of e-cigarettes among a sample of never-smoking youth predicted cigarette smoking initiation over a 2-year period. Design Longitudinal cohort study. Setting 89 high schools across Ontario and Alberta, Canada. Participants A sample of grade 9-11 never-smoking students at baseline (n=9501) who participated in the COMPASS study over 2 years. Primary and secondary outcome measures Participants completed in-class questionnaires that assessed smoking susceptibility and smoking initiation. Results Among the baseline sample of non-susceptible never-smokers, 45.2% of current e-cigarette users reported trying a cigarette after 2 years compared with 13.5% of non-current e-cigarette users. Among the baseline sample of susceptible never-smokers, 62.4% of current e-cigarette users reported trying a cigarette after 2 years compared with 36.1% of non-current e-cigarette users. Overall, current e-cigarette users were more likely to try a cigarette 2 years later. This association was stronger among the sample of non-susceptible never-smokers (AOR=5.28, 95% CI 2.81 to 9.94; p<0.0001) compared with susceptible never-smokers (AOR=2.78, 95% CI 1.84 to 4.20; p<0.0001). Conclusions Findings from this large, longitudinal study support public health concerns that e-cigarette use may contribute to the development of a new population of cigarette smokers. They also support the notion that e-cigarettes are expanding the tobacco market by attracting low-risk youth who would otherwise be unlikely to initiate using cigarettes. Careful consideration will be needed in developing an appropriate regulatory framework that prevents e-cigarette use among youth. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

To model between subject variability of corneal swelling (CS) and deswelling after overnight wear of silicone hydrogel (SiHy) contact lenses. METHODS. A total of 29 neophyte subjects wore 12 SiHy lenses with central transmissibility range of 31 to 211 Dk/t units on separate nights, in random order, and on one eye only. The contralateral eye served as the control. Central corneal thickness was measured using digital optical pachymetry before lens insertion, immediately after lens removal on waking, then 20, 40 minutes, 1, 2, and 3 hours later. Mixed modelling was conducted for simultaneous analysis of group and between-subject effects of CS and deswelling. RESULTS. The best model for overnight CS versus Dk/t was linear with a random intercept showing constant between-subject differences in CS for different Dk/t values. The best fit for corneal deswelling versus time was a curvilinear random intercept and random slope model. About 90% of the total between-subject deswelling variance in either lens or control eyes was due to the intercept variability with much less (~10%) being due to the variability of the individual deswelling rate (slope). Subject age, sex, and ametropia were not predictors of individual corneal swelling in the swelling versus Dk/t analysis. Age, however, was a significant (inverse) predictor of the rate of corneal deswelling, only in lens-wearing eyes. CONCLUSIONS. A large proportion of variability in corneal swelling is because of subject-specific differences in corneal response to hypoxia. This shows that low swellers and high swellers actually do exist. © 2018 The Authors.",Between-subject variability; Corneal deswelling; Corneal swelling; Mixed modeling; Pachymetry,"adult; age; Article; biomicroscopy; central corneal thickness; controlled study; cornea edema; corneal pachymetry; female; human; male; middle aged; model; priority journal; refraction error; young adult; adolescent; adverse device effect; biological model; cornea; cornea edema; double blind procedure; extended wear contact lens; hydrogel; hydrophilic contact lens; pathophysiology; randomized controlled trial; silicone derivative; Adolescent; Adult; Contact Lenses, Extended-Wear; Contact Lenses, Hydrophilic; Cornea; Corneal Edema; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Hydrogels; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Silicones; Young Adult",,Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.,1460404,,IOVSD,29847665,English,Invest.

In the current literature, the seismic risk analysis is largely limited to the evaluation of the average cost of damage, which is not informative about the full extent of variability in the cost. The paper presents a systematic development of the stochastic modeling of seismic risk analysis problem and reformulates the damage cost analysis as a superposition of compound Poisson processes. An explicit analytical solution for the distribution of damage cost is derived in form of a recursive equation. The proposed approach extends the capability of the existing framework of seismic risk analysis, which can be used to optimize initial design and retrofitting of structures. © 2017 The Authors",Damage cost analysis; Laplace transform; Life cycle analysis; Poisson process; Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis; Seismic risk; Stochastic point process; Structural safety,Cost accounting; Costs; Laplace transforms; Life cycle; Poisson distribution; Probability distributions; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Seismic design; Seismology; Stochastic systems; Damage costs; Life cycle analysis; Poisson process; Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis; Seismic risk; Stochastic point process; Structural safety; Cost benefit analysis,,Elsevier B.V.,1674730,,,,English,Struct.

The wireless sensor network nodes should cooperatively adjust their local time according to certain distributed synchronization algorithms to achieve global time synchronization. Conventionally, it is assumed that all nodes in the network are cooperative and well-functioned in the synchronization process. However, in cognitive radio wireless sensor networks, the global time synchronization process among secondary users is prone to fail because the communication process for exchanging synchronization reference may be frequently interrupted by the primary users. The anomaly nodes that failed to synchronize will significantly affect the global convergence performance of the synchronization algorithm. This article proposes an anomaly node detection method for distributed time synchronization algorithm in cognitive radio sensor networks. The proposed method adopts the statistical linear correlation analysis approach to detect anomaly nodes through the historical time synchronization information stored in local nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the robustness of the synchronization algorithm in distributed cognitive radio sensor networks. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.",abnormal node detection; cognitive radio; convergence; time synchronization; Wireless sensor networks,Cognitive radio; Synchronization; Wireless sensor networks; convergence; Distributed synchronization; Global time synchronizations; Linear correlation analysis; Node detection; Synchronization algorithm; Synchronization process; Time synchronization; Sensor nodes,,SAGE Publications Ltd,15501329,,,,English,Int.

However, freezethaw cycles (FTC) may increase the availability of water extractable P (WEP) from damaged plant tissues, leading some to question their efficacy as a nutrient BMP due to their potential to release P during snowmelt. The objectives of this study were to experimentally determine the influence of: (1) FTC magnitude (4°C, ?4 to 4°C, 18 to 4°C, and 18 to 10°C), (2) CC species [cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleoferus Metzg Stokes), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth)], and (3) termination using herbicide on the magnitude of WEP, NH+ 4, and NO - 3 release. Shoot tissue clippings underwent five FTC followed by extraction. Large magnitude FTC from 18 to 4 and 18 to 10°C (heavy frost) elevated WEP release, whereas the ?4 to 4°C (light frost) treatment did not. Responses varied with plant type, where frost-intolerant species released more WEP than frost-tolerant species. In contrast, NH+ 4, and NO - 3 release did not increase following FTC. Termination elevated WEP and NH + 4 release across all temperature treatments.

The most widely used measure of HRQoL for deriving estimates of health-adjusted life expectancy is the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3). The HUI3 is available in most national surveys administered by Statistics Canada, and has been used as part of a microsimulation model to examine the impact of neurological conditions over the life course. Persons receiving home care and nursing home services are often not well-represented in these surveys; however, interRAI assessment instruments are now used as part of normal clinical practice in these settings for nine Canadian provinces/territories. Building on previous research that developed a HUI2 crosswalk for the interRAI assessments, the present study examined a new interRAI HRQoL index crosswalked to the HUI3. Methods: interRAI and survey data were used to examine the distributional properties of global and domain-specific interRAI HRQoL and HUI3 index scores, respectively. Three populations were considered: well-elderly persons not receiving home care, home care clients and nursing home residents. Results: The mean HUI3 and interRAI HRQoL index global scores declined from independent healthy older persons to home care clients, followed by nursing home residents. For the home care and nursing home populations, the interRAI HRQoL global estimates tended to be lower than HUI3 global scores obtained from survey respondents. While there were some statistically significant age, sex and diagnostic group differences in global scores and within attributes, the most notable differences were between populations from different care settings. Discussion: The present study provides strong evidence for the validity of the interRAI HRQoL based on comparisons of distributional properties with those obtained with survey data based on the HUI3. The results demonstrate the importance of admission criteria for home care and nursing home settings, where function plays a more important role than demographic or diagnostic criteria. The interRAI HRQoL has a distinct advantage because it is gathered as part of normal clinical practice in care settings where interRAI instruments are mandatory and are used to assess all eligible persons in those sectors. In particular, those with severe cognitive and functional impairments (who tend to be under-represented in survey data) will be evaluated using the interRAI tools. Future research should build on this work by providing direct, person-level comparisons of interRAI HRQoL index and HUI3 scores, as well as longitudinal analyses to examine responsiveness to change. © 2018, The Author(s).",Assessment; Home care; HUI3; InterRAI; Nursing homes,,,Springer International Publishing,9629343,,QLREE,,English,Qual.

Here we present two case studies for such occurrences: (1) Maniitsoq region (Kangerdluarssuk), where kyanite paragneiss hosts ruby corundum, and (2) Nuuk region (Storø), where sillimanite gneiss hosts ruby corundum. At both occurrences, ultramafic rocks (amphibole-peridotite) are in direct contact with the ruby-bearing zones, which have been transformed to mica schist by metasomatic reactions. The bulk-rock geochemistry of the ruby-bearing rocks is consistent with significant depletion of SiO2 in combination with addition of Al2O3, MgO, K2O, Th and Sr relative to an assumed aluminous precursor metapelite. Phase equilibria modelling supports ruby genesis from the breakdown of sillimanite and kyanite at elevated temperatures due to the removal of SiO2. The juxtaposition of relatively silica- and aluminum-rich metasedimentary rocks with low silica ultramafic rocks established a chemical potential gradient that leached/mobilized SiO2 allowing corundum to stabilize in the former rocks. Furthermore, addition of Al2O3 via a metasomatic reaction is required, because Al/Ti is fractionated between the aluminous precursor metapelites and the resulting corundum-bearing mica schist. We propose that Al was mobilized either by complexation with hydroxide at alkaline conditions, or that Al was transported as K-Al-Si-O polymers at deep crustal levels. The three main exploration vectors for corundum within Archean greenstone belts are: (1) amphibolite- to granulite-facies metamorphic conditions, (2) the juxtaposition of ultramafic rocks and aluminous metapelite, and (3) mica-rich reactions zones at their interface. © 2018 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University",Desilicification; Kyanite; Metasomatism; Pseudosection; Sillimanite; Ultramafic rocks,Archean; corundum; greenstone belt; kyanite; metapelite; metasomatism; ruby; sapphire; sillimanite; ultramafic rock; Arctic; Greenland; North Atlantic Craton,,Elsevier B.V.,16749871,,,,English,Geosci.

In this approach, first, environmental DNA is cloned to generate metagenomic libraries that are maintained in Escherichia coli, and second, the cloned DNA is screened for activities of interest. Typically, functional screens are carried out using E. coli as a surrogate host, although there likely exist barriers to gene expression, such as lack of recognition of native promoters. Here, we describe efforts to develop Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron as a surrogate host for screening metagenomic DNA from the human gut. We construct a B. thetaiotaomicron-compatible fosmid cloning vector, generate a fosmid clone library using DNA from the human gut, and show successful functional complementation of a B. thetaiotaomicron glycan utilization mutant. Though we were unable to retrieve the physical fosmid after complementation, we used genome sequencing to identify the complementing genes derived from the human gut microbiome. Our results demonstrate that the use of B. thetaiotaomicron to express metagenomic DNA is promising, but they also exemplify the challenges that can be encountered in the development of new surrogate hosts for functional screening. IMPORTANCE Human gut microbiome research has been supported by advances in DNA sequencing that make it possible to obtain gigabases of sequence data from metagenomes but is limited by a lack of knowledge of gene function that leads to incomplete annotation of these data sets. There is a need for the development of methods that can provide experimental data regarding microbial gene function. Functional metagenomics is one such method, but functional screens are often carried out using hosts that may not be able to express the bulk of the environmental DNA being screened. We expand the range of current screening hosts and demonstrate that human gut-derived metagenomic libraries can be introduced into the gut microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to identify genes based on activity screening. Our results support the continuing development of genetically tractable systems to obtain information about gene function. © 2018 Ward et al.",Anaerobic sulfatase maturating enzyme; Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; Chondroitin sulfate utilization; Fosmid library; Functional metagenomics; Functional screening; Gut microbiota; Human gut microbiome; Metagenomic library; Surrogate host,glycan; Article; bacterial genome; bacterium mutant; Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; cloning vector; DNA screening; fosmid; human; intestine flora; metagenomics; molecular library; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region,,American Society for Microbiology,23795077,,,,English,mSystems,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046888787,

Recent research has highlighted that the effects of job demands on strain vary across cultures, but similar work has not explored whether this is true for job resources. Given that societal characteristics can influence individuals' cognitive structures and, to a lesser extent, values in a culture, we address this gap in the literature and argue that individuals' strain in reaction to job resources may differ across cultures. Specifically, we theorize that the societal cultural dimensions of individualismcollectivism and uncertainty avoidance shape individual-level job resourcestrain relationships, as they dictate which types of resources (i.e., individual vs. group preference-oriented and uncertainty-reducing vs. not) are more likely to be valued, used, or effective in combating strain within a culture. Results revealed that societal individualismcollectivism and uncertainty avoidance independently moderated the relationships between certain job resources (i.e., job control, participation in decision making, and clear goals and performance feedback) and strain (i.e., job satisfaction and turnover intentions). This study expands our understanding of the cross-cultural specificity versus generalizability of the job demandsresources model. © 2017 The Authors Journal of Organizational Behavior Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",cross-cultural management; culture; individualismcollectivism; job resources; job satisfaction; multilevel modeling; turnover intentions; uncertainty avoidance,,,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,8943796,,,,English,J.

Some have implemented travel clinics to meet the growing demand for pre-travel consultations. As a new service, the outcomes of independent pharmacist-performed pre-travel consultations is unknown. Methods: Chart review and post-travel surveys were performed among a convenience sample of patients presenting to a pharmacist-managed travel clinic for consultation. Data collected included patients travel plans, recommendations for vaccines and other prescription and non-prescription drugs and adherence to these recommendations, satisfaction with the service, and health issues experienced during travel. Results: 103 patients participated in the study. The overwhelming majority (79%) of recommended vaccinations were administered in clinic. The post-travel questionnaire was completed by 76% of patients, with 94% of these reporting being satisfied or very satisfied with the care received. Health issues during travel were infrequent, with gastrointestinal illness most common. Of those patients who experienced any health issue during their trip, 93% felt adequately prepared to manage the condition.

Here, we present evidence from eye movements for a novel mechanism underlying this association. Two groups of 18 Grade 4 children received oral vocabulary training on one set of 16 novel words (e.g., nesh, coib), but no training on another set. The words were assigned spellings that were either predictable from phonology (e.g., nesh) or unpredictable (e.g., koyb). These were subsequently shown in print, embedded in sentences. Reading times were shorter for orally familiar than unfamiliar items, and for words with predictable than unpredictable spellings but, importantly, there was an interaction between the two: children demonstrated a larger benefit of oral familiarity for predictable than for unpredictable items. These findings indicate that children form initial orthographic expectations about spoken words before first seeing them in print.

Not all denervated muscle fibres are degraded; some may be reinnervated by an adjacent surviving neuron, which expands the innervating motor unit proportional to the numbers of fibres rescued. Enlarged motor units have larger motor unit potentials when measured using electrophysiological techniques. We recorded much larger motor unit potentials in relatively healthy older men compared to young men, but the older men with the smallest muscles (sarcopenia) had smaller motor unit potentials than healthy older men. These findings suggest that healthy older men reinnervate large numbers of muscle fibres to compensate for declining motor neuron numbers, but a failure to do so contributes to muscle loss in sarcopenic men. Abstract: Sarcopenia results from the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and reduced function in older age. It is likely to be associated with the well-documented reduction of motor unit numbers innervating limb muscles and the increase in size of surviving motor units via reinnervation of denervated fibres. However, no evidence exists to confirm the extent of motor unit remodelling in sarcopenic individuals. The aim of the present study was to compare motor unit size and number between young (n = 48), non-sarcopenic old (n = 13), pre-sarcopenic (n = 53) and sarcopenic (n = 29) men. Motor unit potentials (MUPs) were isolated from intramuscular and surface EMG recordings. The motor unit numbers were reduced in all groups of old compared with young men (all P < 0.001). MUPs were higher in non-sarcopenic and pre-sarcopenic men compared with young men (P = 0.039 and 0.001 respectively), but not in the vastus lateralis of sarcopenic old (P = 0.485). The results suggest that extensive motor unit remodelling occurs relatively early during ageing, exceeds the loss of muscle mass and precedes sarcopenia. Reinnervation of denervated muscle fibres probably expands the motor unit size in the non-sarcopenic and pre-sarcopenic old, but not in the sarcopenic old. These findings suggest that a failure to expand the motor unit size distinguishes sarcopenic from pre-sarcopenic muscles. © 2018 The Authors.

RESULTS Our analysis found clinic characteristics, including the presence of an electronic medical record, being located in a rural setting, and being in private practice were significantly associated with increased rates of tobacco treatment delivery. Female GPs were more likely than males to arrange follow-up (AOR 3.38, 95%CI 1.11, 10.35). Our analysis found a variety of patient-level factors were positively associated with tobacco treatment delivery, including: longer smoking history; presence of a smoking related illness; readiness to quit smoking; and symptoms or a diagnosis of anxiety, depression or other mental health illness. Other patient-level factors were negatively associated with tobacco treatment delivery, including level of education and reason for visit. Patients seen in clinic for episodic care were less likely to be asked (AOR 0.22, 95%CI 0.12, 0.39), advised (AOR 0.22, 95%CI 0.13, 0.38), and receive assistance (AOR 0.36, 95%CI 0.19, 0.66) compared to patients seen in clinic for a medical examination. CONCLUSIONS Providers are significantly more frequently delivering tobacco treatment to a sub-group of high-risk patients compared to other tobacco users in their clinical practice. This results in missed opportunities for early intervention and disease prevention. © 2018 Papadakis S.",Crete; Factors; Primary health care; Tobacco treatment delivery,adult; anxiety; Article; clinical practice; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; educational status; female; general practitioner; geographic distribution; Greece; health care delivery; health status; high risk patient; human; male; mental disease; middle aged; outcome assessment; priority journal; quasi experimental study; rural area; sex difference; smoking cessation; smoking prevention; social status; symptom; tobacco,,International Society for the Prevention of Tobacco Induced Diseases,16179625,,,,English,Tob.

A large number of existing results focus on the study of vision-based lane detection methods due to the extensive knowledge background and the low-cost of camera devices. In this paper, previous vision-based lane detection studies are reviewed in terms of three aspects, which are lane detection algorithms, integration, and evaluation methods. Next, considering the inevitable limitations that exist in the camera-based lane detection system, the system integration methodologies for constructing more robust detection systems are reviewed and analyzed. The integration methods are further divided into three levels, namely, algorithm, system, and sensor. Algorithm level combines different lane detection algorithms while system level integrates other object detection systems to comprehensively detect lane positions. Sensor level uses multi-modal sensors to build a robust lane recognition system. In view of the complexity of evaluating the detection system, and the lack of common evaluation procedure and uniform metrics in past studies, the existing evaluation methods and metrics are analyzed and classified to propose a better evaluation of the lane detection system. Next, a comparison of representative studies is performed. Finally, a discussion on the limitations of current lane detection systems and the future developing trends toward an Artificial Society, Computational experiment-based parallel lane detection framework is proposed. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.",ACP theory; Advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs); benchmark; lane detection; parallel vision; performance evaluation,Automobile drivers; Benchmarking; Cameras; Indium compounds; Object detection; Signal detection; Acp theories; Artificial societies; Computational experiment; Lane detection; Object detection systems; Parallel vision; Performance evaluations; System integration; Advanced driver assistance systems,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,23299266,,,,English,IEEE CAA J.

HLA genes are implicated in the pathogenesis of PsA. Little is known about the relationship between HLA genetic susceptibility markers and enthesitis in PsA patients. Our aim was to examine the association between HLA genetic susceptibility markers and sonographic enthesitis in PsA. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted in patients with PsA. Sonographic enthesitis was assessed according to the Madrid Sonography Enthesitis Index scoring system. HLA genotyping was performed using sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. The association between 6 HLA susceptibility markers of PsA and the severity of sonographic enthesitis was assessed using multivariate regression models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and disease duration. Results: Two hundred twenty-five patients were included, 57.8% of whom were men. The mean ± SD age was 56.1 ± 12.7 years, and the mean ± SD PsA duration was 16.9 ± 12.3 years. In the multivariate regression model, HLAB*27 was associated with a higher enthesitis score (? = 4.24 [95% confidence interval {95% CI} 0.02, 8.46]), and the interaction between HLAB*27 and PsA duration was statistically significant, showing an increasing effect of HLAB*27 with longer PsA duration (? = 4.62 [95% CI 1.38, 7.86]). Conclusion: HLAB*27 is associated with more severe sonographic enthesitis in PsA, particularly in patients with longer disease duration. This finding highlights the possible role of genetic variants in predisposing to PsA subphenotypes. © 2018, American College of Rheumatology",,biological product; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; HLA B27 antigen; HLA B38 antigen; HLA B39 antigen; HLA B44 antigen; HLA B8 antigen; HLA C antigen; HLA C6 antigen; unclassified drug; adult; age; allele; Article; biological therapy; body mass; cohort analysis; correlation coefficient; cross-sectional study; disease duration; disease severity; echography; enthesitis; female; gene interaction; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genotype; human; immunogenetics; Madrid Sonography Enthesitis Index; major clinical study; male; middle aged; musculoskeletal disease assessment; observational study; oligonucleotide probe; phenotype; priority journal; psoriatic arthritis; sex,,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,23265191,,,29361203,English,Arthritis Rheum.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044500220,

We argue that a principles-first approach offers more flexibility for restoration practitioners than a standards-based approach, is consistent with the developmental stage of restoration, and functions more effectively at a global level. However, the solution is not as simple as arguing that one approach to professional practice is sufficient. Principles and standards can and do operate effectively together, but only if they are coordinated in a transparent and systematic way. Effective professional guidance results when standards anchored by principles function in a way that is contextual and evolving. Without that clear relation to principles, the tendency to promote performance standards may lead to a narrowing of restoration practice and reduction in the potential to resolve very difficult and diverse ecological and environmental challenges. We offer recommendations on how the evolving project of restoration policy by SER and other agencies and organizations can remain open and flexible. © 2018 The Authors.

Almost 80% of children with health disorders lack the developmental skills to take full advantage of school-based education relative to 27% of children without a health disorder. In Canada, there is currently a dearth of nationally representative data on the social determinants of early childhood development for children with health disorders. Evidence from Canada and other countries indicate that poorer developmental outcomes in typically developing children are associated with lower socioeconomic status (SES). However, to date, it is not known whether this relationship is stronger among children with health disorders. The study's objectives are to estimate the prevalence and to investigate social determinants of developmental outcomes for young children with health disorders, using the Early Development Instrument (EDI). Methods and analysis Study objectives will be achieved through three steps. First, using existing EDI data for 10 provinces and 2 territories collected from 2004 to 2015, we will investigate differences in developmental health outcomes among children with identified health disorders. Second, population-level EDI data will be linked with neighbourhood sociodemographic census data to explore associations between socioeconomic characteristics and rates of specific diagnoses among children aged 5-6 years, including trends over time. Third, for 3 of these 12 regions, additional health and/or education databases will be linked at an individual level. These data will be used to establish differences in EDI outcomes in relation to the age-of-onset of diagnosis, and presence of intervention or treatment. Ethics and dissemination Study methodologies have been approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board. The results of the analyses of developmental health outcomes for children with health disorders combined with SES will have implications for both health service delivery and school-based intervention strategies. Results will contribute to a framework for public policy. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.",community child health; developmental neurology & neurodisability; epidemiology; mental health; paediatrics,article; Canada; Canadian; child; child health; childhood; diagnosis; female; health care delivery; human; human experiment; infant; male; mental health; monitoring; neighborhood; neurology; onset age; pediatrics; preschool child; prevalence; public policy; research ethics; social determinants of health; social status,,BMJ Publishing Group,20446055,,,29844103,English,BMJ Open,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053147487,

Use of common data models (CDM) is the predominant approach in order to enable large scale systematic analyses on disparate data models and vocabularies. Current CDM transformation practices depend on proprietarily developed Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) procedures, which require knowledge both on the semantics and technical characteristics of the source datasets and target CDM. Purpose: In this study, our aim is to develop a modular but coordinated transformation approach in order to separate semantic and technical steps of transformation processes, which do not have a strict separation in traditional ETL approaches. Such an approach would discretize the operations to extract data from source electronic health record systems, alignment of the source, and target models on the semantic level and the operations to populate target common data repositories. Approach: In order to separate the activities that are required to transform heterogeneous data sources to a target CDM, we introduce a semantic transformation approach composed of three steps: (1) transformation of source datasets to Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, (2) application of semantic conversion rules to get the data as instances of ontological model of the target CDM, and (3) population of repositories, which comply with the specifications of the CDM, by processing the RDF instances from step 2. The proposed approach has been implemented on real healthcare settings where Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM has been chosen as the common data model and a comprehensive comparative analysis between the native and transformed data has been conducted. Results: Health records of ~1 million patients have been successfully transformed to an OMOP CDM based database from the source database. Descriptive statistics obtained from the source and target databases present analogous and consistent results. Discussion and Conclusion: Our method goes beyond the traditional ETL approaches by being more declarative and rigorous. Declarative because the use of RDF based mapping rules makes each mapping more transparent and understandable to humans while retaining logic-based computability. Rigorous because the mappings would be based on computer readable semantics which are amenable to validation through logic-based inference methods. © 2018 Pacaci, Gonul, Sinaci, Yuksel and Laleci Erturkmen.",Common data model; Healthcare datasets; Pharmacovigilance; Postmarketing safety study; Semantic transformation,adult; article; drug surveillance program; electronic health record; female; human; logic; major clinical study; male; semantics; statistics; validation process,,Frontiers Media S.A.,16639812,,,,English,Front.

Currently, several new generation sensors provided with similar channel characteristics have been operated onboard different satellite platforms, including Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8. Joint use of the observations by different sensors offers an opportunity to meet the demands for emergency requirements. For example, through the combination of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, the land can be observed every 2-3 days at medium spatial resolution. However, differences are expected in radiometric values (e.g., channel reflectance) of the corresponding channels between two sensors. Spectral response function (SRF) is taken as an important aspect of sensor settings. Accordingly, between-sensor differences due to SRFs variation need to be quantified and compensated. The comparison of SRFs shows difference (more or less) in channel settings between Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). Effect of the difference in SRF on corresponding values between MSI and OLI was investigated, mainly in terms of channel reflectance and several derived spectral indices. Spectra samples from ASTER Spectral Library Version 2.0 and Hyperion data archives were used in obtaining channel reflectance simulation of MSI and OLI. Preliminary results show that MSI and OLI are well comparable in several channels with small relative discrepancy (<5%), including the Costal Aerosol channel, a NIR (855-875 nm) channel, the SWIR channels, and the Cirrus channel. Meanwhile, for channels covering Blue, Green, Red, and NIR (785-900 nm), the between-sensor differences are significantly presented. Compared with the difference in reflectance of each individual channel, the difference in derived spectral index is more significant. In addition, effectiveness of linear transformation model is not ensured when the target belongs to another spectra collection. If an improper transformation model is selected, the between-sensor discrepancy will even largely increase. In conclusion, improvement in between-sensor consistency is possibly a challenge, through linear transformation based on model (s) generated from other spectra collections. © Authors 2018.

Traditional approach to obtain heavy metal concentration relying on field sampling and lab testing is expensive and time consuming. Although many related studies use spectrometers data to build relational model between heavy metal concentration and spectra information, and then use the model to perform prediction using the hyperspectral imagery, this manner can hardly quickly and accurately map soil metal concentration of an area due to the discrepancies between spectrometers data and remote sensing imagery. Taking the advantage of easy accessibility of Landsat 8 data, this study utilizes Landsat 8 imagery to retrieve soil Cu concentration and mapping its distribution in the study area. To enlarge the spectral information for more accurate retrieval and mapping, 11 single date Landsat 8 imagery from 2013-2017 are selected to form a time series imagery. Three regression methods, partial least square regression (PLSR), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) are used to model construction. By comparing these models unbiasedly, the best model are selected to mapping Cu concentration distribution. The produced distribution map shows a good spatial autocorrelation and consistency with the mining area locations. © Authors 2018.",Landsat 8; Model selection; Remote sensing imagery; Retrieval; Soil heavy metal; Time series,Copper; Heavy metals; Least squares approximations; Metal testing; Neural networks; Photomapping; Regression analysis; Soils; Spectrometers; Spectroscopy; Time series; LANDSAT; Model Selection; Remote sensing imagery; Retrieval; Soil heavy metals; Remote sensing,Liang X.Osmanoglu B.Soergel U.Honkavaara E.Scaioni M.Peled A.Shaker A.Wu L.Abdulmuttalib H.M.Zhang H.Di K.Tanzi J.J.Komp K.Li R.Stilla U.Jiang J.Faruque F.S.Zhang J.Yoshimura M.,International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,16821750,,,,English,"Int.

In order to shed some light on the microscopic structure of black holes, in this paper, we explore a recently observed phenomenon for black holes namely reentrant phase transition, by employing the Ruppeiner geometry. Interestingly enough, we observe two properties for the phase behavior of small black holes that leads to reentrant phase transition. They are correlated and they are of the interaction type. For the range of pressure in which the system underlies reentrant phase transition, it transits from the large black holes phase to the small one which possesses higher correlation than the other ranges of pressures. On the other hand, the type of interaction between small black holes near the large/small transition line differs for usual and reentrant phase transitions. Indeed, for the usual case, the dominant interaction is repulsive whereas for the reentrant case we encounter an attractive interaction. We show that in the reentrant phase transition case, the small black holes behave like a bosonic gas whereas in the usual phase transition case, they behave like a quantum anyon gas. © 2018 authors.

Previously, our lab discovered that older adults exhibited impaired timing of audiovisual events, particularly when making temporal order judgments (TOJs). Simultaneity judgments (SJs), however, were preserved across the lifespan. Here, we investigate the difference between the TOJ and SJ tasks in younger and older adults to assess neural processing differences between these two tasks and across the lifespan. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were studied to determine between-task and between-age differences. Results revealed task specific differences in perceiving simultaneity and temporal order, suggesting that each task may be subserved via different neural mechanisms. Here, auditory N1 and visual P1 ERP amplitudes confirmed that unisensory processing of audiovisual stimuli did not differ between the two tasks within both younger and older groups, indicating that performance differences between tasks arise either from multisensory integration or higher-level decision-making. Compared to younger adults, older adults showed a sustained higher auditory N1 ERP amplitude response across SOAs, suggestive of broader response properties from an extended temporal binding window. Our work provides compelling evidence that different neural mechanisms subserve the SJ and TOJ tasks and that simultaneity and temporal order perception are coded differently and change with age. © 2018 Basharat, Adams, Staines and Barnett-Cowan.",Aging; Audiovisual; Event-related potentials; Multisensory integration; Simultaneity perception; Temporal binding window; Temporal order perception,adult; aged; aging; article; controlled study; decision making; event related potential; female; human; human experiment; lifespan; male; perception; stimulus,,Frontiers Media S.A.,16625145,,,,English,Front.

We coupled algal biomass and sedimentary characteristics with stable isotope data for 113 fishes and invertebrates in the Canadian Beaufort Sea and Amundsen Gulf to examine how trophic structure was influenced by the vertical water mass structure and by organic matter input regimes, from 20 to 1000 m depths. Indices of community-level trophic diversity (isotopic niche size, 13 C enrichment relative to a pelagic baseline, and ? 13 C isotopic range) increased from west to east, coincident with the use of more diverse dietary carbon sources among benthic functional groups. Data suggested benthic-pelagic trophic coupling was strongest in the western study region where pelagic sinking flux is relatively high, intermediate in the central region dominated by riverine inputs of terrestrial organic matter, and weakest in the east where strong pelagic grazing is known to limit sinking flux. Differences in ? 13 C between pelagic and benthic functional groups (up to 5.7) increased from west to east, and from the near-shore shelf to the upper slope. On the upper slope, much of the sinking organic matter may be intercepted in the water column, and dynamic hydrography likely diversifies available food sources. In waters &gt;750 m there were no clear trends in benthic-pelagic coupling or community-level trophic diversity.

The bubble is forming on a flat plate geometry, subjected to an adverse pressure gradient, featuring maximum reverse flow of approximately 2Â % of the local free-stream velocity. Time-resolved velocity measurements are performed by means of planar and tomographic particle image velocimetry, in the vicinity of the reattachment region. The measurements are complemented with a numerical solution of the boundary layer equations in the upstream field. The combined numerical and measured boundary layer is used as a baseline flow for linear stability theory analysis. The results provide insight into the dynamics of dominant coherent structures that form in the separated shear layer and deform along the span. Stability analysis shows that the flow becomes unstable upstream of separation, where both normal and oblique modes undergo amplification. While the shear layer roll up is linked to the amplification of the fundamental normal mode, the oblique modes at angles lower than approximately are also amplified substantially at the fundamental frequency. A model based on the stability analysis and experimental measurements is employed to demonstrate that the spanwise deformations of rollers are produced due to a superposition of normal and oblique instability modes initiating upstream of separation. The degree of the initial spanwise deformations is shown to depend on the relative amplitude of the dominant normal and oblique waves. This is confirmed by forcing the normal mode through a controlled impulsive perturbation introduced by a spanwise invariant dielectric-barrier-discharge plasma actuator, resulting in the formation of spanwise coherent vortices. The findings elucidate the link between important features in the bubble shedding dynamics and stability characteristics and provide further clarification on the differences in the development of coherent structures seen in recent experiments. Moreover, the results present a handle on the development of effective control strategies that can be used to either promote or suppress shedding in separation bubbles, which is of interest for system performance improvement and control of aeroacoustic emissions in relevant applications. © 2018 Cambridge University PressÂ.",boundary layer separation; boundary layer stability; boundary layers,Boundary layer flow; Deformation; Dielectric materials; Laminar flow; Plasma applications; Shear flow; Stability; Turbulent flow; Velocity measurement; Vortex flow; Adverse pressure gradient; Boundary layer stabilities; Boundary-layer separation; Dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators; Laminar separation bubble; Local free-stream velocity; Particle image velocimetries; Performance improvements; Boundary layers; boundary layer; bubble; flow velocity; laminar flow; pressure gradient; separation; spatiotemporal analysis; vortex flow,,Cambridge University Press,221120,,JFLSA,,English,J.

We show that this difference in performance occurs in machines with inhomogeneous energy level scaling, while quantum machines with homogeneous level scaling behave like classical machines. Our results demonstrate that quantum thermodynamics enables the realization of classically inconceivable Otto machines, such as those with an incompressible working substance.

The present pilot randomised controlled trial is part of a program of work to expand knowledge about the clinical effects of protein delivery to critically ill patients. The primary aim of this pilot study is to determine whether an enteral feeding protocol using a volume target, with additional protein supplementation, delivers a greater amount of protein and energy to mechanically ventilated critically ill patients than a standard nutrition protocol. The secondary aims are to evaluate the potential effects of this feeding strategy on muscle mass and other patient-centred outcomes. Methods: This prospective, single-centred, pilot, randomised control trial will include 60 participants who are mechanically ventilated and can be enterally fed. Following informed consent, the participants receiving enteral nutrition in the intensive care unit (ICU) will be allocated using a randomisation algorithm in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention (high-protein daily volume-based feeding protocol, providing 25 kcal/kg and 1.5 g/kg protein) or standard care (hourly rate-based feeding protocol providing 25 kcal/kg and 1 g/kg protein). The co-primary outcomes are the average daily protein and energy delivered to the end of day 15 following randomisation. The secondary outcomes include change in quadriceps muscle layer thickness (QMLT) from baseline (prior to randomisation) to ICU discharge and other nutritional and patient-centred outcomes. Discussion: This trial aims to examine whether a volume-based feeding protocol with supplemental protein increases protein and energy delivery. The potential effect of such increases on muscle mass loss will be explored. These outcomes will assist in formulating larger randomised control trials to assess mortality and morbidity. © 2018 The Author(s).",Critical care; Critical illness; Dietary protein; Enteral nutrition; Intensive care; Nutritional requirements; Nutritional support,protein; adverse event; Article; controlled study; critically ill patient; energy; enteric feeding; human; hypervolemia; informed consent; intensive care unit; major clinical study; muscle mass; muscle thickness; pilot study; priority journal; prospective study; quadriceps femoris muscle; randomized controlled trial; single blind procedure; supplementation,,BioMed Central Ltd.,20555784,,,,English,Pilot Feasibility Stud.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046127900,

Barriers to HF management are staff knowledge gaps and ineffective interprofessional (IP) communication. This pilot study assessed the acceptability, feasibility, and impact of an intervention to (1) improve HF knowledge; (2) improve IP communication; and (3) integrate improved knowledge and communication processes into work routines. Methods: The intervention provides multimodal IP education about HF in LTC, including specialist-supported bedside teaching. It was piloted on single units in two facilities. A mixed-methods repeated-measures approach was used to collect qualitative and quantitative process and outcome data at baseline and 6 months post-intervention. Results: Results were similar at both sites. Participants developed optimized IP communication to promote HF care. Results indicate a perceived increase in staff confidence and self-efficacy, strengthened assessment and clinical proficiency skills, and more effective IP collaboration. Staff deemed the intervention useful and feasible. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that a novel intervention in which HF-specific knowledge is applied by LTC staff to improve IP collaboration in their own work place is acceptable and feasible and has a favourable preliminary impact on staff knowledge and IP communication. © 2017 The Author(s).",Education; Heart failure; Interprofessional; Nursing home,adult; aged; Article; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical feature; family; feasibility study; feedback system; female; follow up; heart failure; human; interpersonal communication; knowledge; long term care; male; middle aged; pilot study; priority journal; resident; self concept,,BioMed Central Ltd.,20555784,,,,English,Pilot Feasibility Stud.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046712584,

This study examined the predictors that might influence rate of dialysis withdrawal. Existing literature is summarized, analyzed and synthesized to identify gaps in the literature with regard to the factors associated with dialysis withdrawal. Methods: This scoping review used a systematic search to synthesize research findings related to dialysis withdrawal and identified gaps in the literature. The search strategy was developed and applied using PubMed, EMBASE and CINHAL databases. The selection criteria included articles written in English and published between 1997 and 2016 that examined dialysis withdrawal and associated factors in patients with any modality of renal dialysis. Case reports and studies only including renal transplant patients were excluded. Fifteen articles were selected in accordance with these selection criteria. Results: The literature review revealed a scarcity of research on dialysis withdrawal and associated factors. Furthermore, the study findings were inconsistent and inconclusive. Authors have defined dialysis withdrawal in terms of dialysis discontinuation, withholding, death, withdrawal, treatment refusal/cessation, or technique failure. Authors have selected homogeneous patient population on either hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, thus making comparisons of studies and generalization of findings difficult. Conclusion: Future studies should explore the influence of both HD and PD on patient-elected dialysis withdrawal using a large a priori calculated sample size. © 2018 The Author(s).",Dialysis; Dialysis attrition; Dialysis discontinuation; Dialysis withdrawal; Hemodialysis; Peritoneal dialysis; Scoping review,adult; case report; clinical article; death; drug withdrawal; Embase; female; hemodialysis; human; kidney graft; male; Medline; peritoneal dialysis; review; sample size; treatment refusal,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712369,,,29699499,English,BMC Nephrol.,Review,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045889470,

However, due to the high mobility of vehicles and the frequent disruption of communication links, it is very challenging to efficiently optimize collaborative offloading from a group of vehicles. In this paper, we leverage the concept of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and propose a software-defined collaborative offloading (SDCO) solution for heterogeneous vehicular networks. In particular, SDCO can efficiently manage the offloading nodes and paths based on a centralized offloading controller. The offloading controller is equipped with two specific functions: the hybrid awareness path collaboration (HPC) and the graph-based source collaboration (GSC). HPC is in charge of selecting the suitable paths based on the round-trip time, packet loss rate, and path bandwidth, while GSC optimizes the offloading nodes according to the minimum vertex cover for effective offloading. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that SDCO can achieve better offloading efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. © 2018 Wei Quan et al.",,Graphic methods; Vehicles; Explosive growth; Minimum vertex cover; Mobile data traffic; Packet loss rates; Round-trip time; Software defined networking (SDN); State of the art; Vehicular networks; Vehicle to vehicle communications,,Hindawi Limited,15308669,,,,English,Wireless Commun.

Receptor-activator of nuclear factor ?B (RANK), its ligand RANKL and the soluble decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG) are the key regulators of osteoclast differentiation and bone remodelling. We thus hypothesized that RANK/RANKL/OPG, which is a key pathway for bone regulation, is involved in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) physiopathology. Our results show that muscle-specific RANK deletion (mdx-RANK mko ) in dystrophin deficient mdx mice improves significantly specific force [54% gain in force] of EDL muscles with no protective effect against eccentric contraction-induced muscle dysfunction. In contrast, full-length OPG-Fc injections restore the force of dystrophic EDL muscles [162% gain in force], protect against eccentric contraction-induced muscle dysfunction ex vivo and significantly improve functional performance on downhill treadmill and post-exercise physical activity. Since OPG serves a soluble receptor for RANKL and as a decoy receptor for TRAIL, mdx mice were injected with anti-RANKL and anti-TRAIL antibodies to decipher the dual function of OPG. Injections of anti-RANKL and/or anti-TRAIL increase significantly the force of dystrophic EDL muscle [45% and 17% gains in force, respectively]. In agreement, truncated OPG-Fc that contains only RANKL domains produces similar gains, in terms of force production, than anti-RANKL treatments. To corroborate that full-length OPG-Fc also acts independently of RANK/RANKL pathway, dystrophin/RANK double-deficient mice were treated with full-length OPG-Fc for 10 days. Dystrophic EDL muscles exhibited a significant gain in force relative to untreated dystrophin/RANK double-deficient mice, indicating that the effect of full-length OPG-Fc is in part independent of the RANKL/RANK interaction. The sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) activity is significantly depressed in dysfunctional and dystrophic muscles and full-length OPG-Fc treatment increased SERCA activity and SERCA-2a expression. These findings demonstrate the superiority of full-length OPG-Fc treatment relative to truncated OPG-Fc, anti-RANKL, anti-TRAIL or muscle RANK deletion in improving dystrophic muscle function, integrity and protection against eccentric contractions. In conclusion, full-length OPG-Fc represents an efficient alternative in the development of new treatments for muscular dystrophy in which a single therapeutic approach may be foreseeable to maintain both bone and skeletal muscle functions.",Duchenne muscular dystrophy; Osteoprotegerin; SERCA; Skeletal muscle,,,NLM (Medline),20515960,,,29699580,English,Acta Neuropathol Commun,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053681554,

Research on dsRNA-induced immune responses has relied heavily on a commercially available, and biologically irrelevant dsRNA, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). Alternatively, dsRNA can be produced by in vitro transcription (ivt-) dsRNA, with a defined sequence and length. We hypothesized that ivt-dsRNA, containing legitimate viral sequence and length, would be a more appropriate proxy for v-dsRNA, compared with poly I:C. This is the first study to investigate the effects of v-dsRNA on the innate antiviral response and to compare v-dsRNA to ivt-dsRNA-induced responses in fish cells, specifically rainbow trout. Previously, class A scavenger receptors (SR-As) were found to be surface receptors for poly I:C in rainbow trout cells. In this study, ivt-dsRNA binding was blocked by poly I:C and v-dsRNA, as well as SR-A competitive ligands, suggesting all three dsRNA molecules are recognized by SR-As. Downstream innate antiviral effects were determined by measuring IFN and ISG transcript levels using qRT-PCR and antiviral assays. Similar to what has been shown previously with ivt-dsRNA, v-dsRNA was able to induce IFN and ISG transcript production between 3 and 24 h, and its effects were length dependent (i.e., longer v-dsRNA produced a stronger response). Interestingly, when v-dsRNA and ivt-dsRNA were length and sequence matched both molecules induced statistically similar IFN and ISG transcript levels, which resulted in similar antiviral states against two aquatic viruses. To pursue sequence effects further, three ivt-dsRNA molecules of the same length but different sequences (including host and viral sequences) were tested for their ability to induce IFN/ISG transcripts and an antiviral state. All three induced responses similarly. This study is the first of its kind to look at the effects v-dsRNA in fish cells as well as to compare ivt-dsRNA to v-dsRNA, and suggests that ivt-dsRNA may be a good surrogate for v-dsRNA in the study of dsRNA-induced responses and potential future antiviral therapies. © 2018 Poynter and DeWitte-Orr.",Antiviral; Double-stranded RNA; Innate immunity; Rainbow trout; Type I interferon,double stranded RNA; polyinosinic polycytidylic acid; virus RNA; animal cell; Article; cell protection; cell viability; competitive binding assay; controlled study; fluorescence microscopy; gene sequence; genetic transcription; innate immunity; molecular weight; nonhuman; Oncorhynchus mykiss; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; spectrophotometry; Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus,,Frontiers Media S.A.,16643224,,,,English,Front.

Decreased food intake may result in an unhealthy diet, and in malnutrition, which is highly prevalent in patients with COPD. Malnutrition is known to negatively impact clinical outcome and quality of life. Aims: In this qualitative study, we aimed to explore strategies used to overcome food-related challenges, ie, dietary resilience, and whether these led to a healthy diet. Furthermore, we aimed to identify the key themes of motivation for dietary resilience in patients with severe COPD. Methods: In October 2015 to April 2016, 12 patients with severe COPD starting a pulmonary rehabilitation program were interviewed. Qualitative description and thematic analysis were performed. Results: All participants mentioned the use of strategies to overcome challenges. Key themes of motivation for dietary resilience were identified as wanting to be as healthy as possible, staying independent, and promoting a sense of continuity and duty. Two out of 12 participants met the criteria for a healthy diet. Conclusion: Our study showed a variety of motivational factors and strategies reported by patients with severe COPD to overcome food-related challenges. However, the majority (n=10) of the participants did not meet the criteria for a healthy diet. The identified key themes can be used to develop education to support patients with severe COPD to improve their diet. © 2018 ter Beek et al.",Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Diet; Health behavior; Malnutrition; Qualitative; Resilience,"adult; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical article; diet; dietary resilience; female; healthy diet; human; interview; male; pulmonary rehabilitation; qualitative research; thematic analysis; aged; attitude to health; chronic obstructive lung disease; cost of illness; daily life activity; feeding behavior; healthy diet; malnutrition; middle aged; motivation; nutritional status; pathophysiology; procedures; psychological resilience; psychology; respiratory care; severity of illness index; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Cost of Illness; Feeding Behavior; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Healthy Diet; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Malnutrition; Middle Aged; Motivation; Nutritional Status; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Qualitative Research; Resilience, Psychological; Respiratory Therapy; Severity of Illness Index",,Dove Medical Press Ltd.,11769106,,,29719387,English,Int.

In addition to small molecule and protein based Ca2+ probes, DNA has recently emerged as a powerful platform for metal sensing. DNAzymes are DNA-based catalysts, and DNAzyme-based sensors are highly attractive due to their high stability, low cost and excellent sensitivity. EtNa is a recently reported RNA-cleaving DNAzyme that has high selectivity for Ca2+ over Mg2+ and Na+. In this work, a systematic mutation study was performed on EtNa, aiming to further understand its biochemical features and improve sensor performance. Among the 45 tested mutants, EtNa-C5T showed higher activity and even better Ca2+ selectivity compared to the original EtNa. The selectivity for Ca2+ over Na+ improved by ?20-fold. In the presence of 1 mM Ca2+, C5T has a cleavage rate of 0.07 min-1. A catalytic beacon sensor was designed based on the C5T mutant with a detection limit of 11 ?M Ca2+.

This study investigated gait changes between ST and DT walking and between older adult prospective fallers and non-fallers. The results were compared to a study based on retrospective fall occurrence. Seventy-five individuals (75.2 ± 6.6 years; 47 non-fallers, 28 fallers; 6 month prospective fall occurrence) walked 7.62 m under ST and DT conditions while wearing pressure-sensing insoles and accelerometers at the head, pelvis, and on both shanks. DT-induced gait changes included changes in temporal measures, centre of pressure (CoP) path stance deviations and coefficient of variation, acceleration descriptive statistics, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) first quartile, ratio of even to odd harmonics, and maximum Lyapunov exponent. Compared to non-fallers, prospective fallers had significantly lower DT anteriorposterior CoP path stance coefficient of variation, DT head anteriorposterior FFT first quartile, ST left shank mediallateral FFT first quartile, and ST right shank superior maximum acceleration. DT-induced gait changes were consistent regardless of faller status or when the fall occurred (retrospective or prospective).

In conclusion, the approach illustrated through this case study resulted a new way for older adults with MCI to engage in physical activities that is fun and tailored to their abilities. The next phase in our research is to evaluate the exergame against comparable human-guided movements. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Dementia; Exergame; Immersion; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Physical Activity Motivation; Presence; User-centered Design; Virtual Reality,Helmet mounted displays; Human engineering; Neurodegenerative diseases; Software testing; User centered design; Virtual reality; Dementia; Exergame; Immersion; Mild cognitive impairments; Physical activity; Presence; Human computer interaction,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9781450356206; 9781450356213,,,English,Conf Hum Fact Comput Syst Proc,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052019558,

While prior research suggests that sounds might contribute to a more immersive experience in games played on screens and mobile displays, there is not yet evidence of these effects of sound on PX in VR. To address this, we conducted a within-subjects experiment using a commercial horror-adventure game to study the effects of a VR and monitor-display version of the same game on PX. Subsequently, we explored, in a between-subjects study, the effects of audio dimensionality on PX in VR. Results indicate that audio has a more implicit influence on PX in VR because of the impact of the overall sensory experience and that audio dimensionality in VR may not be a significant factor contributing to PX. Based on our findings and observations, we provide five design guidelines for VR games. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",Ambient noises; Audio; Background music; Games; Player experience; Sound effects; Virtual reality,Display devices; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Virtual reality; Ambient noise; Audio; Background musics; Games; Player experience; Sound effects; Audio acoustics,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9781450356206; 9781450356213,,,English,Conf Hum Fact Comput Syst Proc,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046949775,

We address these challenges by designing, implementing, and evaluating multiple versions of M3 Gesture Menu (M3), a reimagination of marking menus targeted at mobile interfaces. M3 is defined on a grid rather than in a radial space, relies on gestural shapes rather than directional marks, and has constant and stationary space use. Our first controlled experiment on expert performance showed M3 was faster and less error-prone by a factor of two than traditional marking menus. A second experiment on learning demonstrated for the first time that users could successfully transition to recall-based execution of a dozen commands after three ten-minute practice sessions with both M3 and Multi-Stroke Marking Menu. Together, M3, with its demonstrated resolution, learning, and space use benefits, contributes to the design and understanding of menu selection in the mobile-first era of end-user computing. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Gesture interface; Marking menu; Novice to expert behavior transition; Smartphone,Computation theory; Human engineering; Controlled experiment; End user computing; Experimental analysis; Expert performance; Gesture interfaces; Marking Menu; Mobile interaction; Novice to expert behavior transition; Human computer interaction,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9781450356206; 9781450356213,,,English,Conf Hum Fact Comput Syst Proc,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046948232,

The robustness of the analyzers is further demonstrated for various angles of incidence up to 0.2.

Thick bonding wire is widely used in power modules and other high power applications. This study examined the case for extending the use of traditional thin wire reliability criteria, namely wire flexure and aspect ratio, to thick wires. Eleven aluminum (Al) and aluminum coated copper (CucorAl) wire samples with diameter 300 ?m were tested experimentally. The wire response was measured using a novel non-contact method. High fidelity FEM models of the wire were developed and validated. We found that wire flexure is not correlated to its stress state or fatigue life. On the other hand, aspect ratio is a consistent criterion of thick wire fatigue life. Increasing the wire aspect ratio lowers its critical stress and increases its fatigue life. Moreover, we found that CucorAl wire has superior performance and longer fatigue life than Al wire. © 2018 by the authors.",Electronic packaging; Heel stress; Power modules; Reliability; Wire bonding,Aluminum; Aluminum coatings; Aspect ratio; Electric power systems; Electronics packaging; Fatigue of materials; Reliability; Consistent criterions; Electronic Packaging; High power applications; Interconnection technique; Noncontact methods; Power module; Reliability criterion; Wire bonding; Wire,,MDPI AG,19961944,,,,English,Mater.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045675374,

Cyclobutanones are hydrolytically stable ?-lactam analogues with potential to inhibit both SBLs and MBLs. We describe solution and crystallographic studies on the interaction of a cyclobutanone penem analogue with the clinically important MBL SPM-1. NMR experiments using 19F-labeled SPM-1 imply the cyclobutanone binds to SPM-1 with micromolar affinity. A crystal structure of the SPM-1:cyclobutanone complex reveals binding of the hydrated cyclobutanone through interactions with one of the zinc ions, stabilisation of the hydrate by hydrogen bonding to zinc-bound water, and hydrophobic contacts with aromatic residues. NMR analyses using a 13C-labeled cyclobutanone support assignment of the bound species as the hydrated ketone. The results inform on how MBLs bind substrates and stabilize tetrahedral intermediates. They support further investigations on the use of transition-state and/or intermediate analogues as inhibitors of all ?-lactamase classes. © 2018 Die Autoren.

Aerobic and progressive resistance exercises have benefits to cognitive performance, though evidence is somewhat inconsistent. We postulate that combined aerobic exercise (AE) and progressive resistance training (RT) (combined exercise) will have a better effect on cognition than a balance and toning control (BAT) intervention in older adults with MCI. We also expect that adding cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation to the combined exercise, as a multimodal intervention, will have synergistic efficacy. Methods: The SYNERGIC trial (SYNchronizing Exercises, Remedies in GaIt and Cognition) is a multi-site, double-blinded, five-arm, controlled trial that assesses the potential synergic effect of combined AE and RT on cognition and mobility, with and without cognitive training and vitamin D supplementation in older adults with MCI. Two-hundred participants with MCI aged 60 to 85 years old will be randomized to one of five arms, four of which include combined exercise plus combinations of dual-task cognitive training (real vs. sham) and vitamin D supplementation (3 × 10,000 IU/wk. vs. placebo) in a quasi-factorial design, and one arm which receives all control interventions. The primary outcome measure is the ADAS-Cog (13 and plus modalities) measured at baseline and at 6 months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes include neuroimaging, neuro-cognitive performance, gait and mobility performance, and serum biomarkers of inflammation (C reactive protein and interleukin 6), neuroplasticity (brain-derived neurotropic factor), endothelial markers (vascular endothelial growth factor 1), and vitamin D serum levels. Discussion: The SYNERGIC Trial will establish the efficacy and feasibility of a multimodal intervention to improve cognitive performance and mobility outcomes in MCI.

Lake Vansjø in southern Norway is one such eutrophic lake impacted by blooms of toxic blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), and classified as moderate ecological status under the EU Water Framework Directive. Future climate change may exacerbate the situation. Here we use a set of chained models (global climate model, hydrological model, catchment phosphorus (P) model, lake model, Bayesian Network) to assess the possible future ecological status of the lake, given the set of climate scenarios and storylines common to the EU project MARS (Managing Aquatic Ecosystems and Water Resources under Multiple Stress). The model simulations indicate that climate change alone will increase precipitation and runoff, and give higher P fluxes to the lake, but cause little increase in phytoplankton biomass or changes in ecological status. For the storylines of future management and land-use, however, the model results indicate that both the phytoplankton biomass and the lake ecological status can be positively or negatively affected. Our results also show the value in predicting a biological indicator of lake ecological status, in this case, cyanobacteria biomass with a BN model. For all scenarios, cyanobacteria contribute to worsening the status assessed by phytoplankton, compared to using chlorophyll-a alone. © 2017 The Authors",Algal blooms; Cyanobacteria; Lake modelling; Multiple stressors; Phosphorus; Water framework directive,"Aquatic ecosystems; Bayesian networks; Biomass; Catchments; Climate models; Environmental regulations; Lakes; Land use; Phosphorus; Phytoplankton; Water conservation; Water quality; Algal blooms; Cyanobacteria; Eu-water framework directives; Multiple stressors; Phytoplankton biomass; Precipitation and runoff; Process oriented models; Water Framework Directives; Climate change; chlorophyll a; phosphorus; algal bloom; Bayesian analysis; bioindicator; climate change; climate effect; computer simulation; cyanobacterium; ecological modeling; environmental stress; lake water; land use; phosphorus; water quality; Article; Bayes theorem; biomass; catchment; climate change; concentration (parameters); ecology; geographic distribution; hydrology; land use; meteorology; Norway; phytoplankton; precipitation; prediction; priority journal; simulation; water analysis; water quality; analysis; Bayes theorem; cyanobacterium; eutrophication; lake; theoretical model; Norway; algae; Chlorophyta; Cyanobacteria; Bayes Theorem; Climate Change; Cyanobacteria; Eutrophication; Lakes; Models, Theoretical; Norway; Phytoplankton; Water Quality",,Elsevier B.V.,489697,,STEVA,29197290,English,Sci.

Failure to correctly identify whether multisensory events occur simultaneously and their sequential order can lead to inaccurate representations of the physical world, poor decision-making and dangerous behavior. Damage to the neural systems that coordinate the relative timing of sensory events may explain some of the long-term consequences associated with concussion. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the perception of simultaneity and the discrimination of temporal order of audiovisual stimuli are impaired in those with a history of concussion. Fifty participants (17 with concussion history) were recruited to complete audiovisual simultaneity judgment (SJ) and temporal order judgment (TOJ) tasks. From these tasks, the TBW and point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) were extracted to assess whether the precision and or the accuracy of temporal perception changes with concussion, respectively. Results demonstrated that those with concussion history have a significantly wider TBW (less precise), with no significant change in the PSS (no change in accuracy), particularly for the TOJ task but no significant differences were found between the SJ and TOJ tasks. Importantly, a negative correlation between the time elapsed since last concussion and TBW width in the TOJ task suggests that precision in temporal perception does improve over time. These findings suggest that those with concussion history display an impairment in the perceived timing of sensory events and that monitoring performance in the SJ and TOJ tasks may be a useful additional assessment tool when making decisions about returning to regular work and play following concussion. © 2018 Wise and Barnett-Cowan.",Auditory; Concussion; Simultaneity; Temporal order; Time perception; Visual,adult; Article; auditory stimulation; brain concussion; clinical article; controlled study; correlational study; decision making; disease severity; female; human; male; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; nervous system parameters; point of subjective simultaneity; self report; task performance; temporal binding window; time perception; visual stimulation,,Frontiers Media S.

We evaluated how accurately measures of resident user status and healthcare use were captured in the Minimum Data Set (MDS) versus administrative data. Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study was conducted on all NH residents (N = 8832) from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, between April 1, 2011 and March 31, 2013. Six study measures exist. NH user status (newly admitted NH residents, those who transferred from one NH to another, and those who died) was measured using both MDS and administrative data. Rates of in-patient hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits without subsequent hospitalization, and physician examinations were also measured in each data source. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV), and overall agreement (kappa, ?) of each measure as captured by MDS using administrative data as the reference source. Also for each measure, logistic regression tested if the level of disagreement between data systems was associated with resident age and sex plus NH owner-operator status. Results: MDS accurately identified newly admitted residents (? = 0.97), those who transferred between NHs (? = 0.90), and those who died (? = 0.95). Measures of healthcare use were captured less accurately by MDS, with high levels of both under-reporting and false positives (e.g., for in-patient hospitalizations sensitivity = 0.58, PPV = 0.45), and moderate overall agreement levels (e.g., ? = 0.39 for ED visits). Disagreement was sometimes greater for younger males, and for residents living in for-profit NHs. Conclusions: MDS can be used as a stand-alone tool to accurately capture basic measures of NH use (admission, transfer, and death), and by proxy NH length of stay. As compared to administrative data, MDS does not accurately capture NH resident healthcare use. Research investigating these and other healthcare transitions by NH residents requires a combination of the MDS and administrative data systems. © 2018 The Author(s).",Healthcare use; MDS records; Nursing homes; Validation,"adult; age; article; cohort analysis; death; diagnostic test accuracy study; emergency ward; false positive result; female; health care utilization; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; information processing; length of stay; major clinical study; male; Manitoba; nursing home patient; predictive value; profit; resident; retrospective study; sample size; validation process; validation study; aged; hospital emergency service; information processing; nursing home; patient attitude; sensitivity and specificity; standards; statistics and numerical data; transition to adult care; validation study; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Datasets as Topic; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Manitoba; Nursing Homes; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Transition to Adult Care",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14726963,,,29642929,English,BMC Health Serv.

Methods: Thirty-one participants with dry eye disease (Ocular Surface Disease Index [OSDI] score ?20 and tear osmolarity ?300 mOsm/L in at least one eye) were enrolled in this prospective, dispensing, non-randomized study involving a baseline visit and 3?week follow-up. Tear osmolarity, non-invasive tear break up time (NITBUT), conjunctival hyperemia, corneal and conjunctival staining were determined at baseline. Participants were instructed to instill one drop of a HP-guar-based drop QID in each eye for 3 weeks. At the follow-up visit, the symptoms and ocular surface parameters were reassessed. At this visit, one HP-guar drop was instilled into each eye and osmolarity was measured after 15 minutes, to examine short-term changes in osmolarity. Results: Twenty-eight participants completed the study (5M, 23F; median age 54 yrs, range 25-83 yrs). At baseline, mean OSDI score was 44.9±15.2 and mean osmolarities were 314.63±11.9/306.6±10.1 mOsm/L (worst eye [WE]/better eye [BE]). After 3 weeks, mean osmolarity reduced to 307.7±15.7/303.9±11.3 mOsm/L (WE/BE; p<0.05 and p=0.228, respectively) and mean OSDI scores reduced to 28.3±17.0 (p<0.01). A significant reduction in osmolarity was observed 15 minutes after instilling the lubricating drop (p<0.05 WE, p=0.09 BE). Significant improvements in central corneal staining (p<0.05 OU) and NITBUT (p<0.05 WE only) were observed. Reductions in conjunctival staining and hyperemia were observed, but were not significant (p>0.05). Conclusions: A significant reduction in tear osmolarity and improvements in dry eye symptoms, corneal staining, and NITBUT were observed after 3 weeks of QID use of a HP-guar-based lubricant drop. A decrease in osmolarity was also demonstrated 15 minutes after drop instillation. © 2018 Ng et al.",Dry eye; Eye drop; HP-guar; Osmolarity; Tear film,artificial tear; hydroxypropyl guar based lubricating eye drop; macrogol 400; systane ultra; unclassified drug; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; conjunctival hyperemia; controlled study; cornea disease; corneal staining; drug efficacy; dry eye; feasibility study; female; follow up; human; male; non invasive tear break up time; Ocular Surface Disease Index; open study; outcome assessment; prospective study; tear osmolarity; treatment duration; visual system parameters,,Dove Medical Press Ltd,11775467,,,,English,Clin.

However, government coverage for services provided by optometrists, non-medical school trained primary eye care providers, varies regionally. Little is known about the impact of a funding model in which ophthalmologist services are government-insured but services provided by optometrists are not, on eye care utilization and eye disease detection and treatment. We aimed to address this question by examining geographic variations in eye care service utilization on Prince Edward Island (PEI). Methods: PEI physician-billing data from 2010 to 2012 was analyzed across five distinct geographic regions (Charlottetown, Summerside, Prince, Queens & Kings and Stratford). The residential location of patients and practice locations of eye care providers were identified using the first three digits of their respective postal code. Age-standardized rates were computed for comparisons across different regions. Results: There were six ophthalmologists practicing on PEI, five with offices in Charlottetown. Twenty optometrists practiced on the island with offices across the province. Stratford is closest and Prince farthest from Charlottetown. Age-standardized utilization rates of ophthalmologists per 100 populations were 10.44 in Charlottetown and 10.90 in Stratford, which was significantly higher than in other regions (7.74-8.92; p < 0.05). The disparities were most pronounced amongst the elderly. The prevalence of glaucoma visits was higher in Charlottetown (6.10%) and Stratford (6.38%) and lower in other regions. A similar pattern was observed for the prevalence of cataract visits. While the prevalence of diabetes visits was higher in Prince and Summerside, the utilization of ophthalmologists by people with diabetes was almost twice as high in Charlottetown (6.49%) than in Prince (3.88%). Conclusions: The observed discrepancies in vision care utilization across geographic regions were likely attributed to barriers in accessing government-insured, geographically concentrated ophthalmologists, as opposed to a reflection of the true differences in eye disease occurrence. The lower prevalence of glaucoma visits in regions farther away from ophthalmologist offices may result in delayed detection and blindness in this population. Encouraging ophthalmologists to work in other areas of the province and/or to publicly fund services provided by optometrists may mitigate the observed disparities.

We first used 3D culture and biosensor imaging to demonstrate that epithelial cells enrich Ras activity, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), and F-actin to their leading edges during migration within tissues. PIP3 enrichment coincided with, and could enrich despite inhibition of, F-actin dynamics, revealing a conserved migratory logic compared with single cells. We discovered that migratory cells can intercalate into the basal tissue surface and contribute to tube elongation. We then connected molecular activities to subcellular mechanics using force inference analysis. Migration and transient intercalation required specific and similar anterior-posterior ratios of interfacial tension. Permanent intercalations were distinguished by their capture at the boundary through time-varying tension dynamics. Finally, we integrated our experimental and computational data to generate a finite element model of tube elongation. Our model revealed that intercalation, interfacial tension dynamics, and high basal stress are together sufficient for mammary morphogenesis. Neumann et al. demonstrate that the spatial asymmetries and molecular logic of migration are conserved between epithelial cells within mammalian tissues and single cells on flat substrates.

Such systems require new types of building blocks, such as memristors that access a quasi-continuous and wide range of conductive states, which is still an obstacle for the realization of high-efficiency and large-capacity learning in neuromorphoric simulation. Here, we introduce hydrogen and sodium titanate nanobelts, the intermediate products of hydrothermal synthesis of TiO2 nanobelts, to emulate the synaptic behavior. Devices incorporating a single titanate nanobelt demonstrate robust and reliable synaptic functions, including excitatory postsynaptic current, paired pulse facilitation, short term plasticity, potentiation and depression, as well as learning-forgetting behavior. In particular, the gradual modulation of conductive states in the single nanobelt device can be achieved by a large number of identical pulses. The mechanism for synaptic functionality of the titanate nanobelt device is attributed to the competition between an electric field driven migration of oxygen vacancies and a thermally induced spontaneous diffusion. These results provide insight into the potential use of titanate nanobelts in synaptic applications requiring continuously addressable states coupled with high processing efficiency. ©2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Efficiency; Electric fields; Hydrothermal synthesis; Nanobelts; Network architecture; Sodium compounds; Titanium dioxide; Vacancies; Biological synapsis; Computational system; Intermediate product; Neumann architecture; Oxygen vacancy migration; Short term plasticity; Sodium titanate nanobelts; Synaptic plasticity; Oxygen vacancies; nanomaterial; oxide; oxygen; sodium titanate; titanium; biological model; chemistry; diffusion; electrode; excitatory postsynaptic potential; human; nerve cell plasticity; synapse; Diffusion; Electrodes; Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; Humans; Models, Neurological; Nanostructures; Neuronal Plasticity; Oxides; Oxygen; Synapses; Titanium",,Royal Society of Chemistry,20403364,,,29546896,English,Nanoscale,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044741438,

First, we explored whether initiating home-based primary care in a frail homebound cohort, influenced hospital use. Second, we explored whether initiating regular home care support for personal care with usual primary care, in a second somewhat less frail cohort, influenced hospital use. Methods: This was a before-after retrospective cohort study of two frail populations in Vancouver, Canada using administrative data to assess the influence of two different services started in two different cohorts over the same time period. The participants were 246 recipients of integrated home-based primary care and 492 recipients of home care followed between July 1st, 2008 and June 30th, 2013 before and after starting their respective services. Individuals in each group were linked to their hospital emergency department visit and discharge abstract records. The main outcome measures were mean emergency department visit and hospital admission rates per 1000 patient days for 21 months before versus the period after receipt of services, and the adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) on these outcomes post receipt of service. Results: Before versus after starting integrated home-based primary care, emergency department visit rates per 1000 patient days (95% confidence intervals) were 4.1 (3.8, 4.4) versus 3.7 (3.3, 4.1), and hospital admissions rates were 2.3 (2.1, 2.5) versus 2.2 (1.9, 2.5). Before versus after starting home care, emergency department visit rates per 1000 patient days (95% confidence intervals) were 3.0 (2.8, 3.2) versus 4.0 (3.7, 4.3) visits and hospital admissions rates were 1.3 (1.2, 1.4) versus 1.9 (1.7, 2.1). Home-based primary care IRRs were 0.91 (0.72, 1.15) and 0.99 (0.76, 1.27) and home care IRRs were 1.34 (1.15, 1.56) and 1.46 (1.22, 1.74) for emergency department visits and hospital admissions respectively. Conclusions: After enrollment in integrated home-based primary care, emergency department visit and hospital admission rates stabilized. After starting home care with usual primary care, emergency department visit and hospital admission rates continued to rise. © 2018 The Author(s).",Community medicine; Family practice/general practice/primary care; Geriatric medicine/care of the elderly; Homecare,"adult; article; Canada; cohort analysis; community medicine; controlled study; emergency ward; female; general practice; geriatrics; home care; hospital admission; human; incidence; information processing; major clinical study; male; primary medical care; recipient; retrospective study; aged; British Columbia; epidemiology; frail elderly; home care; home visit; hospital; hospital discharge; hospital emergency service; hospitalization; organization and management; outcome assessment; primary health care; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; British Columbia; Controlled Before-After Studies; Emergency Service, Hospital; Facilities and Services Utilization; Female; Frail Elderly; Home Care Services; Hospitalization; Hospitals; House Calls; Humans; Male; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Patient Discharge; Primary Health Care; Retrospective Studies",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14726963,,,29622006,English,BMC Health Serv.

We also assess projected changes in snow cover and sea ice likely to occur by mid-century, as simulated by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) suite of Earth system models. The historical datasets show that the fraction of Canadian land and marine areas covered by snow and ice is decreasing over time, with seasonal and regional variability in the trends consistent with regional differences in surface temperature trends. In particular, summer sea ice cover has decreased significantly across nearly all Canadian marine regions, and the rate of multi-year ice loss in the Beaufort Sea and Canadian Arctic Archipelago has nearly doubled over the last 8 years. The multi-model consensus over the 2020-2050 period shows reductions in fall and spring snow cover fraction and sea ice concentration of 5-10?% per decade (or 15-30?% in total), with similar reductions in winter sea ice concentration in both Hudson Bay and eastern Canadian waters.

This study presents an assessment from the CanSISE Network of the ability of the second-generation Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2) and the Canadian Seasonal to Interannual Prediction System (CanSIPS) to simulate and predict snow and sea ice from seasonal to multi-decadal timescales, with a focus on the Canadian sector. To account for observational uncertainty, model structural uncertainty, and internal climate variability, the analysis uses multi-source observations, multiple Earth system models (ESMs) in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), and large initial-condition ensembles of CanESM2 and other models. It is found that the ability of the CanESM2 simulation to capture snow-related climate parameters, such as cold-region surface temperature and precipitation, lies within the range of currently available international models. Accounting for the considerable disagreement among satellite-era observational datasets on the distribution of snow water equivalent, CanESM2 has too much springtime snow mass over Canada, reflecting a broader northern hemispheric positive bias. Biases in seasonal snow cover extent are generally less pronounced. CanESM2 also exhibits retreat of springtime snow generally greater than observational estimates, after accounting for observational uncertainty and internal variability. Sea ice is biased low in the Canadian Arctic, which makes it difficult to assess the realism of long-term sea ice trends there. The strengths and weaknesses of the modelling system need to be understood as a practical tradeoff: the Canadian models are relatively inexpensive computationally because of their moderate resolution, thus enabling their use in operational seasonal prediction and for generating large ensembles of multidecadal simulations. Improvements in climate-prediction systems like CanSIPS rely not just on simulation quality but also on using novel observational constraints and the ready transfer of research to an operational setting. Improvements in seasonal forecasting practice arising from recent research include accurate initialization of snow and frozen soil, accounting for observational uncertainty in forecast verification, and sea ice thickness initialization using statistical predictors available in real time. © Author(s) 2018.",,accuracy assessment; annual variation; climate change; climate prediction; CMIP; frozen ground; ice thickness; real time; sea ice; snow cover; surface temperature; uncertainty analysis; Canada; Canadian Arctic,,Copernicus GmbH,19940416,,,,English,Cryosphere,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045011270,

The primary aims of this randomized controlled trial are to examine the immediate and long-term effects of a 12-weeks supervised group exercise programme on habitual walking speed in older women with osteoporosis and a history of vertebral fracture. The secondary aims are to examine the immediate and long-term effects of the exercise program on physical fitness, fear of falling and quality of life. Methods: The study is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Women aged 65 years or older with osteoporosis and a history of vertebral fracture are included. The intervention group receives a 12-week multicomponent exercise programme, including resistance training combined with balance training. The control group receives usual care. Adherence to the programme will be of importance for the internal validity of the study. Participants in the exercise group who don't attend will be followed up with motivational phone calls. The primary outcome is habitual walking speed over 10 m. Secondary outcomes are health related quality of life (Qualeffo-41, SF-36), physical activity (I-PAQ), Patient Specific Functional Scale, Fear of falling (FES-1) and physical fitness (Senior Fitness test, Functional reach test, 4 square step test, grip strength). Sample size, based on the primary outcome, is 150 participants randomized into the two arms on a 1:1 allocation, including an estimated 20% drop out. Descriptive data will be reported as mean (standard deviation), median (range) or count (percent) as appropriate. The data will be analysed following the intention-to-treat principle. Between group differences in primary and secondary outcomes at 3 months follow-up will be assessed using linear regression models with respective outcome at baseline as covariate and the randomised group as factor. Discussion: This trial will generate new knowledge on the effects of a multicomponent exercise programme among women over 65 years with osteoporosis and a history of vertebral fracture, knowledge that is of importance for clinicians, health managers and policy makers.

Allen Chemistry Library, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; White, M., Engineering & Science Library, Queens University, Kingston, ON, Canada; Szigeti, K., Davis Centre Library, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada","Chemists in academic institutions utilize a variety of resources and strategies to remain current and to track scholarly information, patents, and news. To explore how chemists in academic institutions remain current, librarians at four Canadian university institutions surveyed 231 and interviewed 14 chemistry faculty, staff, and graduate students on their information seeking behaviors and attitudes. According to survey results, a minority of chemists (13.9 percent) acknowledged that they were successfully keeping up to date, while 50.6 percent indicated that they were somewhat successful. However, a significant number of chemists (35.5 percent) indicated that they were unsuccessful and could do better in remaining current with information. Investigators analyzing focus group data identified three emergent themes related to remaining current: (1) there is too much informationand not enough time. No single information seeking strategy works; (2) patents are importantbut messy. Chemists find themselves largely suspicious about the value and credibility of patents; and (3) chemists could do better in keeping up to date with new and emerging technologies. Chemists continue to be open to new tools and resources yet readily acknowledge that they are too often not sure which information seeking behaviors, resources, or strategies work best. This study helps to shed light on opportunities to identify and meet chemists evolving information needs. Published with license by Taylor & Francis © 2018 Ian D.

Using molecular data of 9,125 patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified tumor subtypes in 33 cancer types based on mRNA expression patterns of seven major metabolic processes and assessed their clinical relevance. Our metabolic expression subtypes correlated extensively with clinical outcome: subtypes with upregulated carbohydrate, nucleotide, and vitamin/cofactor metabolism most consistently correlated with worse prognosis, whereas subtypes with upregulated lipid metabolism showed the opposite. Metabolic subtypes correlated with diverse somatic drivers but exhibited effects convergent on cancer hallmark pathways and were modulated by highly recurrent master regulators across cancer types. As a proof-of-concept example, we demonstrated that knockdown of SNAI1 or RUNX1master regulators of carbohydrate metabolic subtypesmodulates metabolic activity and drug sensitivity. Our study provides a system-level view of metabolic heterogeneity within and across cancer types and identifies pathway cross-talk, suggesting related prognostic, therapeutic, and predictive utility. Peng et al. analyze a cohort of 9,125 TCGA samples across 33 cancer types to characterize tumor subtypes based on the expression of seven metabolic pathways. They find metabolic expression subtypes are associated with patient survivals and suggest the therapeutic and predictive relevance of subtype-related master regulators. © 2018 The Author(s)",carbohydrate metabolism; drug sensitivity; master regulator; prognostic markers; somatic drivers; The Cancer Genome Atlas; therapeutic targets; tumor subtypes,messenger RNA; transcription factor RUNX1; transcription factor Snail; Article; cancer classification; cancer prognosis; cancer research; carbohydrate metabolism; clinical assessment; clinical outcome; controlled study; drug sensitivity; gene control; gene expression; gene identification; gene silencing; genetic association; genetic correlation; genetic heterogeneity; human; human cell; lipid metabolism; malignant neoplasm; metabolic activity assay; metabolism; nucleic acid metabolism; priority journal; RUNX1 gene; signal transduction; SNAI1 gene; tumor diagnosis; upregulation; vitamin metabolism,,Elsevier B.V.,22111247,,,29617665,English,Cell Rep.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044606356,

Levels of TSNAs can be modified through manufacturing practices. In the 2000s, TSNA levels in cigarettes sold in Canada were reduced by changes in tobacco curing processes. The current study examined TSNA levels over the following decade to examine trends over time. Methods: Data submitted to Health Canada under the Tobacco Reporting Regulations were used to examine whole tobacco constituents for 1809 brands and mainstream smoke emissions for 191 brands manufactured by Canada's three leading cigarette companies from 2005 through 2011/12 using one-way analysis of variances (ANOVAs) and linear regression models. Results: Levels of N-nitrosoanatabine (NAT) (p < .001) and 4-(methylnitrosamino-1-(3-pyridyl)- 1-butanone (NNK) (p < .001) in whole tobacco showed significant differences over time, decreasing between 2005 and 2007, and generally increasing from 2007 through 2012. Levels of all TSNAs in mainstream smoke emissions reflected a similar pattern: N-nitrosoanabasine (NAB) (p < .001), NAT (p < .001), NNK (p < .001), and N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) (p = .021). Linear regression analyses showed that TSNA levels varied by manufacturer over time in whole tobacco for NAT, NNK, and NNN (p < .001 for all), and in smoke emissions for NAB, NAT, NNK, and NNN (p < .001 for all). Conclusions: The findings indicate that levels of TSNAs in whole tobacco and smoke emissions of cigarettes sold in Canada increased from 2007 through 2011/12, following initial reductions over the previous 2 years. Differences in TSNA levels between companies raise questions about manufacturing practices that may be responsible for these changes. Although increased levels of carcinogenic TSNAs may be alarming, it remains unclear whether these differences translate into differences in health risk. Implications: The wide variation of TSNAs within the Canadian market across time and across cigarette companies demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the levels of these potent carcinogens. Although it is unclear whether changes made to levels of TSNAs will result in less tobacco-related disease, the tobacco industry bears a responsibility to minimize the harm from smoking to the fullest extent possible. © The Author(s) 2017.

The main contribution of this paper is to address two issues. One is that we impose a proper periodic boundary condition, such that when the reference and template images are related by translation, or a combination of translation and non-rigid deformation, the numerical solution gives the underlying transformation. The other is that we design a numerical scheme that converges to the optimal transformation between the two images. As an additional benefit, our approach can decompose the transformation into translation and non-rigid deformation. Our numerical results show that the numerical solutions yield good-quality transformations for non-rigid image registration problems. © 2018 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.",Finite difference; Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation; Image registration; Mass transport; Monge-Ampère equation; Monotonicity; Periodic boundary condition; Viscosity solution,,,American Institute of Mathematical Sciences,19308337,,,,English,Inverse Probl.

However, the divalent charge of zinc ions, which restricts the choice of host material due to hindered solid-state diffusion, can also pose a problem for interfacial charge transfer. Here, we report our findings on reversible intercalation of up to two Zn2+ ions in layered V3O7·H2O. This material exhibits very high capacity and power (375 mA h g-1 at a 1C rate, and 275 mA h g-1 at an 8C rate) in an aqueous electrolyte compared to a very low capacity and slow rate capabilities in a nonaqueous medium. Operando XRD studies, together with impedance analysis, reveal solid solution behavior associated with Zn2+-ion diffusion within a water monolayer in the interlayer gap in both systems, but very sluggish interfacial charge transfer in the nonaqueous electrolyte. This points to desolvation at the interface as a major factor in dictating the kinetics. Temperature dependent impedance studies show high activation energies associated with the nonaqueous charge transfer process, identifying the origin of poor electrochemical performance. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Activation energy; Charge transfer; Diffusion in solids; Electric batteries; Electrolytes; Renewable energy resources; Zinc; Charge transfer process; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical performance; High activation energy; Interfacial charge transfer; Non-aqueous electrolytes; Renewable energy technologies; Solid-state diffusion; Ions; alternative energy; aqueous solution; diffusion; electrochemical method; electrode; electrolyte; fuel cell; performance assessment,,Royal Society of Chemistry,17545692,,,,English,Energy Environ.

Different rates of utilization of mental health services in local areas reflect geographic variation of mental health and complexity of health care. Variations and inequalities in how the health care system addresses risks are two critical issues for addressing population mental health. This study examines these issues by analyzing the utilization of mental health services in Toronto at the neighbourhood level. We adopted a shared component spatial modeling approach that allows simultaneous analysis of two main health service utilizations: doctor visits and hospitalizations related to mental health conditions. Our results reflect a geographic variation of both types of mental health service utilization across neighbourhoods in Toronto. We identified hot and cold spots of mental health risks that are common to both or specific to only one type of health service utilization. Based on the evidence found, we discuss intervention strategies, focusing on the hotspots and provision of health services about doctors and hospitals, to improve mental health for the neighbourhoods. Limitations of the study and further research directions are also discussed. © 2018 by the authors.

Despite their widespread use, little research has empirically tested the impact of attention checks on scale validity. In fact, because attention checks can induce a more deliberative mindset in survey respondents, they may change the way respondents answer survey questions, posing a threat to scale validity. In two studies, we tested this hypothesis (N = 816). We examined whether common attention checksinstructed-response items (Study 1) and an instructional manipulation check (Study 2)impact responses to a well-validated management scale. Results showed no evidence that they affect scale validity, both in reported scale means and tests of measurement invariance.

Specifically, West Nile virus (WNv) is a significant and increasing threat to wildlife populations and human health throughout North America. Mosquito control is an important means of controlling the spread of WNv, as the virus is primarily spread between avian and mosquito vectors. This is of particular concern for avian host species such as the Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus uro-phasianus), in which WNv negatively impacts fitness parameters. Most mosquito control methods focus on the larval stages. In North America, control efforts are largely limited to larvicides, which require repeated application and have potentially negative ecological impacts. There are multiple potential advantages to using indigenous fish species as an alternative for larval control including lowered environmental impact, decreased costs in terms of time and financial inputs, and the potential for the establishment of self-sustaining fish populations. We tested the efficacy of using fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) as biological control for mosquito populations in livestock reservoirs of semiarid rangelands. We introduced minnows into 10 treatment reservoirs and monitored an additional 6 non-treated reservoirs as controls over 3 years. Adult mosquitoes of species known to transmit WNv (e.g., Culex tarsalis) were captured at each site and mosquito larvae were also present at all sites. Stable isotope analysis confirmed that introduced fathead minnows were feeding at the mosquito larvae trophic level in all but one treatment pond. Treatment ponds demonstrated suppressed levels of mosquito larva over each season compared to controls with a model-predicted 114% decrease in larva density within treatment ponds. Minnows established self-sustaining populations throughout the study in all reservoirs that maintained sufficient water levels. Minnow survival was not influenced by water quality. Though minnows did not completely eradicate mosquito larvae, minnows are a promising alternative to controlling mosquito larvae density within reservoirs. We caution that careful site selection is critical to avoid potential negative impacts, but suggest the introduction of fathead minnows in reservoirs can dramatically reduce mosquito larva abundance and potentially help mitigate vector-borne disease transmission. © 2018 Watchorn et al.

Much of what is known about DOP is derived from radiotracer studies using gel chromatography, and summarized by a kinetic model (Lean, Science 179:678680, 1973a; Lean, J Fish Res Board Can 30:15251536, 1973b). Since this work, several relevant discoveries have been made on the role of enzymes, viruses and zooplankton in regenerating dissolved P, and the role of filtration damage in generating dissolved P in filtrates. Herein we present the results of new radiotracer experiments on the fate of DOP in lake water filtrates, consistent with the hypothesis that some of the high molecular weight organic P breaks down spontaneously to smaller molecules, which in turn break down to PO4 3?. We use inhibitors, including competitive inhibitors of phosphatases and a commercial product (RNA-later®) to support the hypothesis that the larger molecules include nucleic acids, and that the smaller molecules are substrates for alkaline phosphatase. We also find that colloidal P (i.e., P &gt; 5000 MW according to gel filtration) includes some virus-sized material that can be collected on 0.02 or 0.03 µm filters. Finally, we provide a new model of the cycling of epilimnetic P that is consistent with these and earlier observations. © 2018, The Author(s).",Colloidal phosphorus; Dissolved organic phosphorus; Nutrient cycling; Phosphorus cycle; Plankton,colloid; dissolved organic phosphorus; enzyme; experimental study; filtration; inhibition; lake water; membrane; nutrient cycling; observational method; particulate matter; phosphorus cycle; plankton; sulfate; zooplankton,,Birkhauser Verlag AG,10151621,,AQSCE,,English,Aquatic Sci.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044391100,

These advances have provided new opportunities for geographical information science and spatial analysisallowing the tools and theories to be expanded to new domain areas and providing the impetus for theory and methodological development. In this light, old problems of inference and analysis are rediscovered and need to be reinterpreted, and new ones are made apparent. This article describes a new typology of geographical analysis problems that relates to uncertainties in the relationship between individual-level data, represented as point features, and the geographic context(s) that they are associated with. We describe how uncertainty in context linkage (uncertain geographic context problem) is also related to, but distinct from, uncertainty in point-event locations (uncertain point observation problem) and how these issues can impact spatial analysis. A case study analysis of a geosocial dataset demonstrates how alternative conclusions can result from failure to account for these sources of uncertainty. Sources of point observation uncertainties common in many forms of user-generated and big spatial data are outlined and methods for dealing with them are reviewed and discussed. © 2018 The Authors.

Previously, we demonstrated that a distributed network (including the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex) was active when participants updated their initial representations (e.g., it's a cat) in a gradually morphing picture task (e.g., now it's a rabbit; Stöttinger et al., 2015). To shed light on whether these activations reflect the proactive decisions to update or perceptual uncertainty, we introduced two additional conditions. By presenting picture morphs twice we controlled for uncertainty in perceptual decision making. Inducing an abrupt shift in a third condition allowed us to differentiate between a proactive decision in uncertainty-driven updating and a reactive decision in surprise-based updating. We replicated our earlier result, showing the robustness of the effect. In addition, we found activation in the anterior insula (bilaterally) and the mid frontal area/ACC in all three conditions, indicative of the importance of these areas in updating of all kinds. When participants were naïve as to the identity of the second object, we found higher activations in the mid-cingulate cortex and cuneus  areas typically associated with task difficulty, in addition to higher activations in the right TPJ most likely reflecting the shift to a new perspective. Activations associated with the proactive decision to update to a new interpretation were found in a network including the dorsal ACC known to be involved in exploration and the endogenous decision to switch to a new interpretation. These findings suggest a general network commonly engaged in all types of perceptual decision making supported by additional networks associated with perceptual uncertainty or updating provoked by either proactive or reactive decision making. © 2018 The Authors","Perceptual decision making, anterior insula; Proactive vs. reactive; Representational updating; Uncertainty","adult; anterior insula; article; cingulate gyrus; cuneus; decision making; dorsal region; female; human; human experiment; identity; male; temporoparietal junction; uncertainty; brain cortex; brain mapping; decision making; diagnostic imaging; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; vision; young adult; Adult; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Visual Perception; Young Adult",,Elsevier Ltd,283932,,NUPSA,29550524,English,Neuropsychologia,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044038934,

Biofiltration with and without prior in-line coagulation was assessed for UF membrane fouling reduction. Two parallel pilot-scale biofilters, each with different media (sand vs. anthracite), were operated under identical conditions at a hydraulic loading rate of 0.75 m/h. A component of this investigation included the in-line application of a 1.0 mg/L dose of ferric sulfate prior to an anthracite biofilter. All UF membrane fouling experiments were conducted at bench-scale at a constant flux of 32 L/m2h (LMH). The sand (BF1) and anthracite biofilters (BF2) removed on average 25 and 20%, respectively, of the biopolymer fraction of the effluent organic matter. Humic substances were less well removed at about 10%, while biofilter influent turbidity was reduced by 75 and 70% through BF1 and BF2, respectively. Feeding the UF membrane with biofilter effluent (no prior coagulant addition) substantially reduced both hydraulically reversible and irreversible membrane fouling by up to 60 and 80%, respectively.

Here we introduce a pair approximation model of individual uptake of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for an acute self-limiting infection, where susceptible individuals can learn the NPIs either from other susceptible individuals who are already practicing NPIs (social learning), or their uptake of NPIs can be stimulated by being neighbours of an infectious person (exposure learning). NPIs include individual measures such as hand-washing and respiratory etiquette. Individuals can also drop the habit of using NPIs at a certain rate. We derive a spatially defined expression of the basic reproduction number R0 and we also numerically simulate the model equations. We find that exposure learning is generally more efficient than social learning, since exposure learning generates NPI uptake in the individuals at immediate risk of infection. However, if social learning is pre-emptive, beginning a sufficient amount of time before the epidemic, then it can be more effective than exposure learning. Interestingly, varying the initial number of individuals practicing NPIs does not significantly impact the epidemic final size. Also, if initial source infections are surrounded by protective individuals, there are parameter regimes where increasing the initial number of source infections actually decreases the infection peak (instead of increasing it) and makes it occur sooner. The peak prevalence increases with the rate at which individuals drop the habit of using NPIs, but the response of peak prevalence to changes in the forgetting rate are qualitatively different for the two forms of learning. The pair approximation methodology developed here illustrates how analytical approaches for studying interactions between social processes and disease dynamics in a spatially structured population should be further pursued.",Network model; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Pair approximation; Social distancing; Transmission model,"algorithm; animal; basic reproduction number; behavior; biological model; communicable disease; computer simulation; epidemic; health behavior; human; learning; patient education; prevalence; risk; social learning; statistical model; transmission; vaccination; Algorithms; Animals; Basic Reproduction Number; Behavior; Communicable Diseases; Computer Simulation; Disease Outbreaks; Epidemics; Health Behavior; Humans; Learning; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Patient Education as Topic; Prevalence; Risk; Social Learning; Vaccination",,American Institute of Mathematical Sciences,15471063,,,29161845,English,Math.

We have evaluated an alternative means of estimating MU number that takes into account differences in muscle size. Methods: Intramuscular motor unit potentials (MUPs) were recorded and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured using MRI to provide a motor unit number estimate (iMUNE). This was compared to the traditional MUNE method, using compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) and surface motor unit potentials (sMUPs) recorded using surface electrodes. Data were collected from proximal and distal regions of the vastus lateralis (VL) in young and old men while testretest reliability was evaluated with VL, tibialis anterior and biceps brachii. Results: MUPs, sMUPs and CMAPs were highly reliable (r = 0.840.91). The traditional MUNE, based on surface recordings, did not differ between proximal and distal sites of the VL despite the proximal CSA being twice the distal CSA. iMUNE, however, gave values that differed between young and old and were proportional to the muscle size. Conclusion: When evaluating the contribution that MU loss makes to muscle atrophy, such as in disease or ageing, it is important to have a method such as iMUNE, which takes into account any differences in total muscle size. © 2018, The Author(s).",Electromyography; Motor unit number estimation; Skeletal muscle; Vastus lateralis,"action potential; adult; electromyography; human; limb; male; motoneuron; physiology; procedures; quadriceps femoris muscle; skeletal muscle; young adult; Action Potentials; Adult; Electromyography; Extremities; Humans; Male; Motor Neurons; Muscle, Skeletal; Quadriceps Muscle; Young Adult",,Springer Verlag,14396319,,EJAPF,29356950,English,Eur.

Amorphous P compounds formed by alkali aluminate chemical addition may also be subject to leaching. Crystalline mineralization is the desired end effect that isolates P thoroughly from the water resource. Using new low-energy iron electrochemistry (EC-P process), dissolved ferrous iron reacts with sewage phosphate ions (PO4) and precipitates onto filtration medium as vivianite [Fe3(PO4)2·8H2O], as identified by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction and predicted from Eh-pH-aHPO4 2 phase relations. Removal rates of 90-99% in sand, soil and synthetic foam filters are obtained. The precipitation of vivianite demonstrates that P can be immobilized quickly and without intermediary adsorption phases, as with Fe-rich soils. Vitreous silicate material (VSM) or rockwool that traps and precipitates mineral P after EC-P treatment was investigated as a means of P reuse as a fertilizing soil amendment. Comparative soil leaching and growth studies using corn plants demonstrate that the VSM alone reduces P losses from soils, and that VSM which has received EC-P effluent is equivalent to or better than commercial superphosphate fertilizer. © 2018 The Authors.",Fertilizer; Phosphorus; Recovery; Sewage; Soil amendment; Vivianite,Effluents; Fertilizers; Filtration; Iron compounds; Leaching; Phosphate minerals; Phosphorus; Recovery; Scanning electron microscopy; Sewage; Silicates; Sodium Aluminate; Water resources; Adsorption phasis; Chemical addition; Mineral precipitation; Septic tank effluent; Silicate material; Soil amendment; Superphosphate fertilizers; Vivianite; Soils; ferrous ion; iron; phosphate; phosphorus; silicate; unclassified drug; vivianite; mineral; adsorption; electrochemistry; growth; ion; leaching; mineral; mineralization; phosphate; phosphorus; precipitation (chemistry); recovery method; sewage; sewage treatment; silicate mineral; soil amendment; superphosphate; vivianite; adsorption; Article; controlled study; effluent; electrochemistry; filtration; foam; leaching; maize; mineralization; precipitation; sand; scanning electron microscopy; sewage; soil amendment; soil fertilization; waste component removal; X ray diffraction; adsorption; soil; Zea mays; Adsorption; Minerals; Phosphorus; Sewage; Soil,,IWA Publishing,2731223,,WSTED,29722682,English,Water Sci.

A comprehensive framework to formulate the problem is the standard model extension (SME) proposed by A. Kostelecky, where violation of Lorentz invariance is encoded into specific coefficients. Here we present a procedure to link the deformation parameter ? of the generalized uncertainty principle to the SME coefficients of the gravity sector. The idea is to compute the Hawking temperature of a black hole in two different ways. The first way involves the deformation parameter ?, and therefore we get a deformed Hawking temperature containing the parameter ?. The second way involves a deformed Schwarzschild metric containing the Lorentz violating terms s?? of the gravity sector of the SME. The comparison between the two different techniques yields a relation between ? and s??. In this way bounds on ? transferred from s?? are improved by many orders of magnitude when compared with those derived in other gravitational frameworks. Also the opposite possibility of bounds transferred from ? to s?? is briefly discussed. © 2018 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.

The extent to which the dependence in some feature of the disease process (e.g., presence, age of onset, severity) varies according to the kinship of individuals reflects the evidence of a genetic cause for disease. When the probands are selected from a disease registry, it is common for them to provide quite detailed information regarding their disease history, but non-probands often simply provide their disease status at the time of contact. We develop conditional second-order estimating equations for studying the nature and extent of within-family dependence which recognizes the biased sampling scheme employed in family studies and the current status data provided by the non-probands. Simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the finite sample performance of different estimating functions and to quantify the empirical relative efficiency of the various methods. Sensitivity to model misspecification is also explored.

We developed an exercise program from yoga postures with a minimal knee adduction moment for knee osteoarthritis. The purpose was to compare the effectiveness of this biomechanically-based yoga exercise (YE), with traditional exercise (TE), and a no-exercise attention-equivalent control (NE) for improving pain, self-reported physical function and mobility performance in women with knee osteoarthritis. Design Single-blind, three-arm randomized controlled trial. Setting Community in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. Participants A convenience sample of 31 women with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis was recruited through rheumatology, orthopaedic and physiotherapy clinics, newspapers and word-of-mouth. Interventions Participants were stratified by disease severity and randomly allocated to one of three 12-week, supervised interventions. YE included biomechanically-based yoga exercises; TE included traditional leg strengthening on machines; and NE included meditation with no exercise. Participants were asked to attend three 1-hour group classes/sessions each week. Measurements Primary outcomes were pain, self-reported physical function and mobility performance. Secondary outcomes were knee strength, depression, and health-related quality of life. All were assessed by a blinded assessor at baseline and immediately following the intervention. Results The YE group demonstrated greater improvements in KOOS pain (mean difference of 22.9 [95% CI, 6.9 to 38.8; p = 0.003]), intermittent pain (mean difference of -19.6 [95% CI, -34.8 to -4.4; p = 0.009]) and self-reported physical function (mean difference of 17.2 [95% CI, 5.2 to 29.2; p = 0.003]) compared to NE. Improvements in these outcomes were similar between YE and TE. However, TE demonstrated a greater improvement in knee flexor strength compared to YE (mean difference of 0.1 [95% CI, 0.1 to 0.2]. Improvements from baseline to follow-up were present in quality of life score for YE and knee flexor strength for TE, while both also demonstrated improvements in mobility. No improvement in any outcome was present in NE. Conclusions The biomechanically-based yoga exercise program produced clinically meaningful improvements in pain, self-reported physical function and mobility in women with clinical knee OA compared to no exercise. While not statistically significant, improvements in these outcomes were larger than those elicited from the traditional exercise-based program. Though this may suggest that the yoga program may be more efficacious for knee OA, future research studying a larger sample is required. © 2018 Kuntz et al.

Zircon U-Pb ages, Hf data, and structural data indicate that the Cathaysia block consists of two terranes, West Cathaysia and East Cathaysia, separated by a newly recognized major strike-slip fault. We propose that West Cathaysia was part of a microcontinent that originated from a Grenvillian-aged orogen in the Rodinia supercontinent, East Cathaysia originated from an Indosinian-aged orogen in the Paleo-Tethyan regime to the south and was translated to the east of West Cathaysia through strike-slip motion, and the early Paleozoic Wuyi-Yunkai orogeny was a result of direct collision of West Cathaysia with a yet-unidentified terrane that rifted away after the collision. We conclude that a multiterrane Wilson cycle (multi-terrane accretion-collision, large-scale strike-slip motion, and separation of two terranes by post-collisional rifting along the suture zone) characterizes the history of South China and may be a common feature of orogens. © 2018 Geological Society of America.",,Binary alloys; Geochronology; Lead; Lead alloys; Silicate minerals; Strike-slip faults; Uranium alloys; Zircon; Cathaysia block; Common features; Early Paleozoic; Rodinia supercontinent; Strike-slip motion; Structural data; Terrane accretion; Zircon U-Pb age; Tectonics,,Geological Society of America,917613,,GLGYB,,English,Geology,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044339135,

Subsequently, several studies have investigated the effect of vitamin D supplementation in persons with epilepsy being treated with AEDs. The present systematic review of published literature was conducted to determine the effect of vitamin D intervention on bone health in adults with epilepsy. Methods: The following databases were searched using keywords including but not limited to epilepsy, bone, and vitamin D: PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Clinical Trials, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Health Canada Clinical Trials Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials, and Google. Studies were eligible if there was an epilepsy diagnosis, participants were adults (18+ years old), and vitamin D treatment and bone outcome were provided. Articles were screened independently by 2 reviewers. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and a modified Newcastle Ottawa Scale for nonrandomized studies. Results: Nine studies were found to be eligible for this review. After vitamin D treatment, there appeared to be positive changes in bone turnover markers; 3 of 8 studies found the increase in serum calcium to be significant, 6 of 8 studies found the decrease in alkaline phosphatase to be significant, and 2 of 4 studies found the decrease in parathyroid hormone to be significant. All 6 studies that investigated bone mineralization had significant findings; however, due to varying methodologies, the impact of vitamin D on bone mineralization was inconclusive. Significance: Vitamin D does appear to have some benefit to bone health in adults with epilepsy, and therefore supplementation could potentially be a requisite to using some AEDs. To clarify the role of vitamin D supplementation to manage the adverse effect of AEDs on bone health in adults with epilepsy, long-term trials that use higher doses (>1800 IU) and measure bone mineral density are necessary.

Scaling up the delivery of supplements such as SQ-LNS hinges on understanding private demand and creatively leveraging policy-relevant factors that might influence demand. We used longitudinal stated willingness-to-pay (WTP) data from contingent valuation studies that were integrated into randomized controlled nutrition trials in Ghana and Malawi to estimate private valuation of SQ-LNS during pregnancy, postpartum, and early childhood. We found that average stated WTP for a day's supply of SQ-LNS was more than twice as high in Ghana than Malawi, indicating that demand for SQ-LNS (and by extension, the options for effective delivery of SQ-LNS) may be very context specific. We also examined factors associated with WTP, including intervention group, household socioeconomic status, birth outcomes, child growth, and maternal and child morbidity. In both sites, WTP was consistently negatively associated with household food insecurity, indicating that subsidization might be needed to permit food insecure households to acquire SQ-LNS if it is made available for purchase. In Ghana, WTP was higher among heads of household than among mothers, which may be related to control over household resources. Personal experience using SQ-LNS was not associated with WTP in either site. © 2017 The Authors.

First, we define local environmental stewardship as the actions taken by individuals, groups or networks of actors, with various motivations and levels of capacity, to protect, care for or responsibly use the environment in pursuit of environmental and/or social outcomes in diverse socialecological contexts. Next, drawing from a review of the environmental stewardship, management and governance literatures, we unpack the elements of this definition to develop an analytical framework that can facilitate research on local environmental stewardship. Finally, we discuss potential interventions and leverage points for promoting or supporting local stewardship and future applications of the framework to guide descriptive, evaluative, prescriptive or systematic analysis of environmental stewardship. Further application of this framework in diverse environmental and social contexts is recommended to refine the elements and develop insights that will guide and improve the outcomes of environmental stewardship initiatives and investments. Ultimately, our aim is to raise the profile of environmental stewardship as a valuable and holistic concept for guiding productive and sustained relationships with the environment. © 2018, The Author(s).",Capacity; Conservation; Environmental management; Environmental stewardship; Motivations; Sustainability,Conservation; Environmental protection; Motivation; Sustainable development; Capacity; Conceptual review; Environmental stewardship; Future applications; Leverage points; Social context; Social outcomes; Systematic analysis; Environmental management; analytical framework; conceptual framework; conservation management; environmental assessment; environmental economics; environmental management; environmental policy; environmental protection; investment; sustainability; valuation; adult; article; controlled study; drawing; environmental management; human; human experiment; investment; motivation; social environment; cooperation; ecology; environmental policy; environmental protection; motivation; procedures; research; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cooperative Behavior; Ecology; Environmental Policy; Humans; Investments; Motivation; Research,,Springer New York LLC,0364152X,,EMNGD,29387947,English,Environ.

However, the sequestration capacity of an argillaceous natural barrier may change as a result of dynamic environmental conditions, in particular changes in redox state. Here, we imposed redox cycles to argillaceous suspensions amended with a mixture of the inorganic contaminants As(V), Sb(V), Cr(VI), by alternating 7-day cycles of sparging with either oxic or anoxic gas mixtures. During the redox cycles, we assessed the relative importance of different contaminant sequestration mechanisms under sterile and non-sterile conditions. The non-sterile experiments were carried out 1) with the argillaceous material as is, that is, containing the native microbial population, 2) with the addition of ethanol as a source of labile organic carbon, and 3) with the addition of both ethanol and a soil microbial inoculum. In order to capture the observed solid-solution partitioning trends, a series of mixed thermodynamic-kinetic models representing the dynamic conditions in the experiments were developed using PHREEQC. Parameter values for processes such as adsorption, which occurred in all experiments, were kept constant across all the simulations. Additional formulations were introduced as needed to account for the microbial detoxification and respiration of the contaminants in the increasing complexity experiments. Abiotic adsorption of As and abiotic reductive precipitation of Cr dominated sequestration of these two contaminants under all experimental conditions, whereas the presence of microorganisms was essential to decrease the aqueous Sb concentration. Once reduced, As(III), Sb(III), and Cr(III) were not re-oxidized upon exposure to dissolved O2 in any of the experiments. Neither the mineralogy nor the native microbiota catalysed contaminant oxidation processes. Thus, kinetically, the reduction of As(V), Sb(V), and Cr(VI) was irreversible over the experimental duration (49 days). The capacity of the argillaceous matrix to reduce and sequester the aqueous contaminants, without subsequent remobilization to the aqueous phase during the oxic periods, supports the use of argillaceous barriers for geologic waste storage. © 2018 The Authors",Antimony; Argillaceous suspension; Arsenic; Chromium; Detoxification; Nuclear waste repository; Redox oscillations; Reduction; Respiration; Sequestration,Antimony; Antimony compounds; Arsenic; Carbon; Chromium; Clay minerals; Contamination; Detoxification; Ethanol; Geological repositories; Impurities; Minerals; Organic carbon; Reduction; Environmental conditions; Nuclear waste repositories; Redox oscillations; Reductive precipitation; Respiration; Sequestration; Solid solution partitioning; Thermodynamic-kinetic model; Chromium compounds; adsorption; anion; anoxic conditions; antimony; argillaceous deposit; arsenic; chemical pollutant; chromium; concentration (composition); detoxification; ethanol; experimental study; inoculation; natural barrier; organic carbon; oxic conditions; oxidation; partitioning; pollutant; precipitation (chemistry); redox conditions; reduction; remobilization; soil microorganism; speciation (chemistry),,Elsevier Ltd,8832927,,APPGE,,English,Appl.

Yet such transformations are not always viewed as politically feasible; finding ways to enhance the political feasibility of ambitious decarbonization trajectories is needed. This paper reviews the role of social justice as an organizing principle for politically feasible 1.5°C transformations. A social justice lens usefully focuses attention on first, protecting vulnerable people from climate change impacts, second, protecting people from disruptions of transformation, and finally, enhancing the process of envisioning and implementing an equitable post-carbon society. However, justice-focused arguments could also have unintended consequences, such as being deployed against climate action. Hence proactively engaging with social justice is critical in navigating 1.5°C societal transformations. © 2017 The Authors",,carbon budget; climate change; climate effect; feasibility study; global climate; political change; social change; social justice; vulnerability,,Elsevier B.V.,18773435,,,,English,Curr.

LMPAs are expected to achieve multiple objectives, and because of their size are postulated to avoid trade-offs that are common in smaller MPAs. However, evaluations across multiple outcomes are lacking. We used a systematic approach to code several social and ecological outcomes of 12 LMPAs. We found evidence of three types of trade-offs: trade-offs between different ecological resources (supply tradeoffs); trade-offs between ecological resource conditions and the well-being of resource users (supply-demand trade-offs); and trade-offs between the well-being outcomes of different resource users (demand trade-offs). We also found several divergent outcomes that were attributed to influences beyond the scope of the LMPA. We suggest that despite their size, trade-offs can develop in LMPAs and should be considered in planning and design. LMPAs may improve their performance across multiple social and ecological objectives if integrated with larger-scale conservation efforts. © 2018 Davies et al.

A systematic way of testing gene categories leads to testing hundreds of null hypotheses that correspond to nodes in a directed acyclic graph. The relationships among gene categories induce logical restrictions among the corresponding null hypotheses. An existing fully Bayesian method is powerful but computationally demanding. Results: We develop a computationally efficient method based on a hidden Markov tree model (HMTM). Our method is several orders of magnitude faster than the existing fully Bayesian method. Through simulation and an expression quantitative trait loci study, we show that the HMTM method provides more powerful results than other existing methods that honor the logical restrictions. Conclusions: The HMTM method provides an individual estimate of posterior probability of being differentially expressed for each gene set, which can be useful for result interpretation.

Here we present 6-phosphonomethylpyridine-2-carboxylates (PMPCs) as potent inhibitors of subclass B1 (IMP-1, VIM-2, and NDM-1) and B3 (L1) MBLs. Inhibition followed a competitive, slow-binding model without an isomerization step (IC 50 values of 0.3-7.2 ?M; K i values of 0.03-1.5 ?M). Minimum inhibitory concentration assays demonstrated potentiation of ?-lactam (Meropenem) activity against MBL-producing bacteria, including clinical isolates, at concentrations at which eukaryotic cells remain viable. Crystal structures revealed unprecedented modes of binding of inhibitor to B1 (IMP-1) and B3 (L1) MBLs. In IMP-1, binding does not replace the nucleophilic hydroxide, and the PMPC carboxylate and pyridine nitrogen interact closely (2.3 and 2.7 Å, respectively) with the Zn2 ion of the binuclear metal site. The phosphonate group makes limited interactions but is 2.6 Å from the nucleophilic hydroxide. Furthermore, the presence of a water molecule interacting with the PMPC phosphonate and pyridine N-C2 ?-bond, as well as the nucleophilic hydroxide, suggests that the PMPC binds to the MBL active site as its hydrate. Binding is markedly different in L1, with the phosphonate displacing both Zn2, forming a monozinc enzyme, and the nucleophilic hydroxide, while also making multiple interactions with the protein main chain and Zn1. The carboxylate and pyridine nitrogen interact with Ser221 and -223, respectively (3 Å distance). The potency, low toxicity, cellular activity, and amenability to further modification of PMPCs indicate these and similar phosphonate compounds can be further considered for future MBL inhibitor development. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,Antibiotics; Carboxylation; Enzymes; Molecules; Nitrogen; Pyridine; Cellular activities; Clinical isolates; Gram-negative bacteria; Minimum inhibitory concentration; Multiple interactions; Phosphonate group; Potent inhibition; Pyridine nitrogen; Bacteria; 6 phosphonomethylpyridine 2 carboxylate derivative; antiinfective agent; enzyme inhibitor; metallo beta lactamase; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; beta lactamase; beta lactamase inhibitor; animal cell; antibacterial activity; Article; bacterial growth; controlled study; drug identification; drug structure; drug synthesis; enzyme active site; enzyme binding; enzyme inhibition; enzyme kinetics; enzyme structure; growth inhibition; human; human cell; hydrophobicity; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; priority journal; protein protein interaction; rat; bacterium; chemistry; enzymology; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; beta-Lactamase Inhibitors; beta-Lactamases,,American Chemical Society,62960,,BICHA,29485857,English,Biochemistry,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044635223,

The nuclear density of the target nucleus is a fundamental ingredient in the construction of the optical potential and thus plays an important role in the description of the scattering process. Purpose: In this paper we derive a microscopic optical potential for intermediate energies using ab initio translationally invariant nonlocal one-body nuclear densities computed within the no-core shell model (NCSM) approach utilizing two- and three-nucleon chiral interactions as the only input. Methods: The optical potential is derived at first order within the spectator expansion of the nonrelativistic multiple scattering theory by adopting the impulse approximation. Nonlocal nuclear densities are derived from the NCSM one-body densities calculated in the second quantization. The translational invariance is generated by exactly removing the spurious center-of-mass (COM) component from the NCSM eigenstates. Results: The ground-state local and nonlocal densities of He4,6,8, C12, and O16 are calculated and applied to optical potential construction. The differential cross sections and the analyzing powers for the elastic proton scattering off these nuclei are then calculated for different values of the incident proton energy. The impact of nonlocality and the COM removal is discussed. Conclusions: The use of nonlocal densities has a substantial impact on the differential cross sections and improves agreement with experiment in comparison to results generated with the local densities especially for light nuclei. For the halo nuclei He6 and He8, the results for the differential cross section are in a reasonable agreement with the data although a more sophisticated model for the optical potential is required to properly describe the analyzing powers. © 2018 American Physical Society.",,,,American Physical Society,24699985,,,,English,Phys.

A case is made for a generalized gravitational theory called Scalar-Tensor-Vector-Gravity (STVG) or MOG (Modified Gravity) to explain merging cluster dynamics. The paper presents the results of a re-analysis of the Bullet Cluster, as well as an analysis of the Train Wreck Cluster in the weak gravitational field limit without dark matter. The King-? model is used to fit the X-ray data of both clusters, and the ?-maps are computed using the parameters of this fit. The amount of galaxies in the clusters is estimated by subtracting the predicted ?-map from the ?-map data. The estimate for the Bullet Cluster is that 14.1% of the cluster is composed of galaxies. For the TrainWreck Cluster, if the Jee et al. data are used, 25.7% of the cluster is composed of galaxies. The baryon matter in the galaxies and the enhanced strength of gravitation in MOG shift the lensing peaks, making them offset from the gas. The work demonstrates that this generalized gravitational theory can explain merging cluster dynamics without dark matter. © 2018 by the authors.",Bullet Cluster; Scalar tensor vector gravity; Train Wreck Cluster,,,MDPI AG,20754434,,,,English,Galaxies,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045127192,

With the development of cloud computing, database owners are motivated to outsource the large size of biometric data and identification tasks to the cloud to get rid of the expensive storage and computation costs, which, however, brings potential threats to users' privacy. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving biometric identification outsourcing scheme. Specifically, the biometric To execute a biometric identification, the database owner encrypts the query data and submits it to the cloud. The cloud performs identification operations over the encrypted database and returns the result to the database owner. A thorough security analysis indicates that the proposed scheme is secure even if attackers can forge identification requests and collude with the cloud. Compared with previous protocols, experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves a better performance in both preparation and identification procedures. © 2013 IEEE.",Biometric identification; cloud computing; data outsourcing; privacy-preserving,Anthropometry; Bioinformatics; Biological systems; Biometrics; Cloud computing; Cryptography; Database systems; Digital storage; Network protocols; Outsourcing; Query processing; Biological system modeling; Biometric identifications; Data outsourcing; Encrypted database; Identification procedure; Potential threats; Privacy preserving; Security analysis; Data privacy,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044394294,

Although the general operability of CWs has been shown in previous studies, the suitability of peat soils as a bed medium for a vertical flow through a system for nitrate attenuation has not been proven to date. In this study, a mesocosm experiment was conducted under continuous flow with conditions aiming to quantify nitrate (NO3 -) removal efficiency in degraded peat soils. Input solution of NO3 - was supplied at three different concentrations (65, 100, and 150 mg/L). Pore water samples were collected at different depths and analyzed for NO3 -, pH, and dissolved N2O concentrations. The redox potential (Eh) was registered at different depths. The results showed that the median NO3-N removal rate was 1.20 g/(m2·day) and the median removal efficiency was calculated as 63.5%. The nitrate removal efficiency was affected by the NO3 - supply load, flow rate, and environmental boundary conditions. A higher NO3 - removal efficiency was observed at an input NO3 - concentration of 100 mg/L, a lower flow rate, and higher temperature. The results of pore water pH and NO3 - and N2O levels from the bottom of the mesocosm suggest that N2 is the dominant denitrification product. Thus, degraded peat soils showed the potential to serve as a substrate for the clean-up of nitrate-laden agricultural runoff. © 2018 by the authors.",Bed medium; Constructed wetlands; Degraded peat; Mesocosm experiment; Nitrate attenuation,Agricultural runoff; Agriculture; Denitrification; Efficiency; Nitrates; Peat; Redox reactions; Water; Wetlands; Bed medium; Constructed wetlands; Constructed wetlands (CWs); Environmental boundary conditions; Favorable conditions; Heterotrophic denitrification; Mesocosms; Removal efficiencies; Soils,,MDPI AG,20734441,,,,English,Water,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044410372,

We focus on Gaussian states which include ground states of free quantum field theories and their approximations encountered in the context of the continuous version of the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz. Our proposal for quantifying state complexity is based on the Fubini-Study metric. It leads to counting the number of applications of each gate (infinitesimal generator) in the transformation, subject to a state-dependent metric. We minimize the defined complexity with respect to momentum-preserving quadratic generators which form su(1,1) algebras. On the manifold of Gaussian states generated by these operations, the Fubini-Study metric factorizes into hyperbolic planes with minimal complexity circuits reducing to known geodesics. Despite working with quantum field theories far outside the regime where Einstein gravity duals exist, we find striking similarities between our results and those of holographic complexity proposals. © 2018 authors.

Rotation is seen to change the internal solitary-like waves observed in the absence of rotation into a leading Kelvin wave followed by Poincaré waves. Mass and energy is found to be advected towards the right-most side wall (for a Northern Hemisphere rotation), leading to increased amplitude of the leading Kelvin wave and the formation of Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instabilities on the upper and lower edges of the deformed pycnocline. These fundamentally three-dimensional instabilities are localized within a region near the side wall and intensify in vigour with increasing rotation rate. Secondary Kelvin waves form further behind the wave from either resonance with radiating Poincaré waves or the remnants of the K-H instability. The first of these mechanisms is in accord with published work on mode-1 Kelvin waves; the second is, to the best of our knowledge, novel to the present study. Both types of secondary Kelvin waves form on the same side of the channel as the leading Kelvin wave. Comparisons of equivalent cases with different Schmidt numbers indicate that while adopting a numerically advantageous low Schmidt number results in the correct general characteristics of the Kelvin waves, excessive diffusion of the pycnocline and various density features precludes accurate representation of both the trailing Poincaré wave field and the intensity and duration of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. © 2018 Author(s).",,,,Copernicus GmbH,10235809,,,,English,Nonlinear Processes Geophys.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044180506,

The former sets the limit for the maximum achievable accelerating gradient, while the latter determines how efficiently flux can be expelled related to the maximum achievable quality factor. In this paper, a method based on muon spin rotation (?SR) is developed to probe these parameters on samples. It combines measurements from two different spectrometers, one being specifically built for these studies and samples of different geometries. It is found that annealing at 1400 °C virtually eliminates all pinning. Such an annealed substrate is ideally suited to measure Hentry of layered superconductors, which might enable accelerating gradients beyond bulk niobium technology. © 2018 authors.

To date, most studies of obesity and overweight in Peru are focused on adults, with few of them involving children, a population at a critical stage of development. The trend in overweight and obesity prevalence in Peruvian children under the age of five has not yet been determined. Thus, the objective of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence rates of overweight and obesity between 2010 and 2015 in children under the age of five, stratified by geographical areas in Peru. Methods: Data were obtained from the Nutritional Status Information System of Peru. The total number of children evaluated was 14,155,914. For the Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the program Geo Da 1.8® was used to ascertain the spatial distribution of prevalence rates and was mapped for children under five. To assess the degree of spatial dependence, exploratory spatial data analysis was performed using the Moran's I statistic and was assessed with the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis to identify geographic concentrations of high and low of obesity and overweight levels. Results: Between 2010 and 2015, the national prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity ranged from 6.2%- 6.8% and 1.5%-2.7%, respectively. The highest prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity was found in 2014 and 2013, respectively. During these years, we observed that obesity decreased, but overweight remained stable. The highest prevalence of overweight and obesity was found in the departments located on the coast. Significant positive spatial autocorrelation was found for both overweight and obesity. The departments with the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity were concentrated in Lima, Callao, Ica, Moquegua and Tacna. The lowest were found in Loreto, Cusco and San Martin. Conclusion: The decrease in obesity and the stabilisation of overweight are positive results for the Peruvian childhood. However, in comparison with other Latin American countries, Peru still lags in obesity prevention. © 2018 The Author(s).",Children; GIS; Obesity; Overweight; Peru; Spatial clustering,"childhood obesity; geography; health disparity; human; infant; Peru; preschool child; prevalence; spatial analysis; Child, Preschool; Geography; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Infant; Pediatric Obesity; Peru; Prevalence; Spatial Analysis",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712458,,,29540170,English,BMC Public Health,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043753235,

We have previously shown that maximal SERCA activity is significantly reduced in mechanically overloaded (OVL) plantaris, however, whether changes in PC:PE ratio or fatty acyl composition may contribute to the alterations in maximal SERCA activity remain unknown. Here, we tested the hypotheses that in OVL plantaris 1) PC:PE ratio would negatively correlate with maximal SERCA activity and 2) PC fatty acyl chain length (ACL) and/or MUFA:PUFA ratio would positively correlate with maximal SERCA activity. Methods: To overload plantaris in mice, we transected the soleus and gastrocnemius tendons from one leg, while the contralateral leg underwent a sham surgery. After two weeks, plantaris muscles were extracted, homogenized and processed for SERCA activity and lipid analyses. Specifically, we performed HPTLC densitometry to examine changes in PC, PE, and the ratio of PC:PE. We also performed gas chromatography to assess any potential changes to fatty acyl composition. Results: SERCA activity was significantly reduced in OVL plantaris compared with sham. Coinciding with this, we found a significant increase in PC but not PE in OVL plantaris. In turn, there was an increase in PC:PE but did not reach significance (p = 0.09). However, we found a significant negative correlation between PC:PE and maximal SERCA activity. Fatty acyl composition of PE remained similar between OLV and sham and PC demonstrated higher percent mole fraction of 17:1, 18:1, and ACL compared to sham. In addition, PC ACL, % MUFA, % PUFA, or MUFA:PUFA did not significantly correlate with maximal SERCA activity. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the phospholipid headgroup PC:PE negatively correlated and could potentially contribute to reductions in SERCA activity seen in functionally overloaded plantaris. In contrast, fatty acyl chain (ACL, % MUFA, % PUFA, MUFA:PUFA) did not correlate with maximal SERCA activity. Future studies will determine whether altering PC:PE with genetic and dietary interventions can influence SERCA activity and ultimately change the physiological outcome in response to muscle overloading. © 2018 The Author(s).",Overload; Phospholipid; Skeletal muscle,"monounsaturated fatty acid; phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylethanolamine; polyunsaturated fatty acid; sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transporting adenosine triphosphatase; omega 3 fatty acid; phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylethanolamine; sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transporting adenosine triphosphatase; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; gas chromatography; gastrocnemius muscle; high performance thin layer chromatography; lipid analysis; lipid composition; male; mechanical stress; mouse; muscle hypertrophy; muscle stress; nonhuman; plantaris muscle; sham procedure; soleus muscle; animal; chemistry; metabolism; skeletal muscle; Animals; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Mice; Muscle, Skeletal; Phosphatidylcholines; Phosphatidylethanolamines; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases",,BioMed Central Ltd.,1476511X,,,29534725,English,Lipids Health Dis.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043599106,

Knowledge exchange provides an opportunity to reduce this gap; however, there has been limited evaluation of these initiatives. This research explored researchers' and knowledge users' perceptions of outcomes associated with a knowledge exchange initiative within COMPASS, a longitudinal study of Canadian secondary students and schools. Schools received annual tailored summaries of their students' health behaviours and suggestions for action and were linked with knowledge brokers to support them in taking action to improve student health. Methods: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with COMPASS researchers (n = 13), school staff (n = 13), and public health stakeholders (n = 4) to explore their experiences with COMPASS knowledge exchange. Key issues included how knowledge users used school-specific findings, perceived outcomes of knowledge exchange, and suggestions for change. Results: Outcomes for both knowledge users and researchers were identified; interestingly, knowledge users attributed more outcomes to using school-specific findings than knowledge brokering. School and public health participants indicated school-specific findings informed their programming and planning. Importantly, knowledge exchange provided a platform for partnerships between researchers, schools, and public health units. Knowledge brokering allowed researchers to gain feedback from knowledge users to enhance the study and a better understanding of the school environment. Interestingly, COMPASS knowledge exchange outcomes aligned with Samdal and Rowling's eight theory-driven implementation components for health-promoting schools. Hence, knowledge exchange may provide a mechanism to help schools implement a health-promoting schools approach. Conclusions: This research contributes to the limited literature regarding outcomes of knowledge brokering in public health and knowledge exchange in school health research. However, since not all schools engaged in knowledge brokering, and not all schools that engaged discussed these outcomes, further research is needed to determine the amount of engagement required for change and examine the process of COMPASS knowledge brokering to consider how to increase school engagement. © 2018 The Author(s).",Knowledge brokering; Knowledge exchange; Knowledge translation; Qualitative research; School health,adult; article; clinical article; female; health behavior; human; longitudinal study; male; perception; public health; qualitative research; school health service; scientist; semi structured interview; staff; student; Canada; organization and management; outcome assessment; personnel; psychology; qualitative research; school health service; stakeholder engagement; statistics and numerical data; translational research; university; Canada; Faculty; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Public Health; Qualitative Research; Research Personnel; School Health Services; Stakeholder Participation; Translational Medical Research,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712458,,,29534698,English,BMC Public Health,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043595289,

The proposed method was tested against the state-of-The-Art (SOA) control scheme using a Fitts' law approach. Methods: Seven able-bodied subjects performed a series of target acquisition myoelectric control tasks using the AEN and SOA algorithms for controlling two degrees-of-freedom (radial/ulnar deviation and flexion/extension of the wrist), and their online performance was characterized by six metrics. Results: Both methods allowed a completion rate close to 100%, however AEN outperformed SOA for all other performance metrics, e.g. it allowed to perform the tasks on average in half the time with respect to SOA. Moreover, the amount of information transferred by the proposed method in bit/s was nearly twice the throughput of SOA. Conclusions: These results show that autoencoders can map EMG signals into kinematics with the potential of providing intuitive and dexterous control of artificial limbs for amputees. © 2018 The Author(s).",Autoencoding; Myoelectric signal processing; Online performance; Prosthetic control; Regression,adult; Article; artificial neural network; autoencoding; calibration; controlled study; electromyogram; electromyography; female; human; human experiment; kinematics; learning algorithm; male; mathematical computing; mathematical model; myoelectric control; nonlinear system; normal human; online analysis; priority journal; signal processing; simulation; task performance; unsupervised machine learning; validation process,,BioMed Central Ltd.,17430003,,,,English,J.

Traditionally, interdisciplinary efforts to mitigate AMR in the food chain have involved public health, human and veterinary medicine, and agriculture stakeholders. Our objective was to identify a more diverse range of stakeholders, beyond those traditionally engaged in AMR mitigation efforts, via diagramming both proximal and distal factors impacting, or impacted by, use and resistance along the Canadian food chain. Results: We identified multiple stakeholders that are not traditionally engaged by public health when working to mitigate AMR in the food chain, including those working broadly in the area of food (e.g., nutrition, food security, international market economists) and health (e.g., health communication, program evaluation), as well as in domains as diverse as law, politics, demography, education, and social innovation. These findings can help researchers and policymakers who work on issues related to AMR in the food chain to move beyond engaging the 'traditional' agri-food stakeholders (e.g., veterinarians, farmers), to also engage those from the wider domains identified here, as potential stakeholders in their AMR mitigation efforts. © 2018 The Author(s).",Antimicrobial resistance; Food safety; Participatory epidemiology; Public health policy,"antibiotic resistance; Canada; food control; food safety; health care policy; participatory research; public health; Canada; Community-Based Participatory Research; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Food Microbiology; Food Safety; Health Policy; Public Health",,BioMed Central Ltd.,17560500,,,29530079,English,BMC Res.

Among these nanocarriers, polymeric micelles have been considered as one of the most promising nanocarriers, some of which have already been applied in different stages of clinical trials. The successful advantages of polymeric micelles from bench to bedside are due to their special core/shell structures, which can carry specific drugs in certain disease conditions. Particularly, poly(ethylene glycol)-polylactide (PEG-PLA) micelles have been considered as one of the most promising platforms for drug delivery. The PEG shell effectively prevents the adsorption of proteins and phagocytes, thereby evidently extending the blood circulation period. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic PLA core can effectively encapsulate many therapeutic agents. This review summarizes recent advances in PEG-PLA micelles for the treatment of malignancy. In addition, future perspectives for the development of PEG-PLA micelles as drug delivery systems are also presented. © 2018 Wang, Li, Han, Guan, Chung, Wang and Li.",Antitumor treatment; Controlled drug release; Micelle; Nanocarrier; Poly(ethylene glycol); Polylactide,"2,5 bis[2,5 bis(2 thienyl) n dodecyl pyrrole]thieno[3,4 b][1,2,5]thiadiazole; ag 050; andrographolide; curcumin; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; docetaxel; doxorubicin; indolicidin; macrogol; paclitaxel; photosensitizing agent; polylactide; protoporphyrin; small interfering RNA; thiadiazole derivative; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; unclassified drug; cancer chemotherapy; cancer gene therapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer therapy; controlled drug release; drug delivery system; human; malignant neoplasm; micelle; nonhuman; photodynamic therapy; photothermal therapy; Review",,Frontiers Media S.A.,16639812,,,,English,Front.

Data are provided by multiple, and often physically separated sources, cognitive workload is high, and team communication can be challenging. Our aim is to combine information from multiple monitoring and therapeutic devices in a mobile application, the VitalPAD, to improve the efficiency of clinical decision-making, communication, and thereby patient safety. We observed individual ICU clinicians, multidisciplinary rounds, and handover procedures for 54 h to identify data needs, workflow, and existing cognitive aid use and limitations. A prototype was developed using an iterative participatory design approach; usability testing, including general and task-specific feedback, was obtained from 15 clinicians. Features included map overviews of the ICU showing clinician assignment, patient status, and respiratory support; patient vital signs; a photo-documentation option for arterial blood gas results; and team communication and reminder functions. Clinicians reported the prototype to be an intuitive display of vital parameters and relevant alerts and reminders, as well as a user-friendly communication tool. Future work includes implementation of a prototype, which will be evaluated under simulation and real-world conditions, with the aim of providing ICU staff with a monitoring device that will improve their daily work, communication, and decision-making capacity. Mobile monitoring of vital signs and therapy parameters might help improve patient safety in wards with single-patient rooms and likely has applications in many acute and critical care settings. © 2013 IEEE.",Communication systems; decision support systems; human factors; patient monitoring; user centered design,Artificial intelligence; Communication systems; Decision making; Decision support systems; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Iterative methods; Patient monitoring; Patient treatment; User centered design; Clinical decision making; Communication device; Communication tools; Complex environments; Intelligent monitoring; Mobile applications; Multi-disciplinary teams; Participatory design; Intensive care units; adult; arterial gas; article; assisted ventilation; clinical decision making; decision support system; documentation; human; intensive care unit; mobile application; patient monitoring; patient safety; postmarketing surveillance; simulation; staff; vital sign; workflow,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21682372,,,,English,IEEE J.

Depending upon the application, e.g. paints, paper, ceramics, etc. different instrument designs and measurement geometries are specified in standard test methods. For a given specular angle, these instrument designs can be broadly classified as converging beam (TAPPI method) and collimated beam (DIN method). In recent comparisons of specular gloss measurements using different glossmeters, very large standard deviations have been reported, well exceeding the manufacturers claims. In this paper, we investigate the effect of instrument beam geometry on gloss measurements. These results indicate that this difference in beam geometry can give the magnitude of gloss differences reported in these comparisons and highlights the importance of educating the user community of best measurement practices and obtaining appropriate traceability for their glossmeters. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Geometry; Radiometry; Collimated beams; Instrument designs; Manufactured goods; Measurement geometry; Measurement practices; Specular gloss measurements; Standard deviation; Standard test method; Gloss measurement,Grobner J.,Institute of Physics Publishing,17426588,,,,English,J.

The model takes into consideration the increase in the effective volume fraction of droplets, due to the presence of an interfacial layer of solid nanoparticles at the oil-water interface. The model also considers aggregation of droplets and eventual jamming of Pickering emulsion at high volume fraction of dispersed phase. According to the proposed model, the relative viscosity of a Pickering emulsion at low shear rates is dependent on three factors: contact angle, ratio of bare droplet radius to solid nanoparticle radius, and the volume fraction of bare droplets. For a given radius of nanoparticles, the relative viscosity of a Pickering emulsion increases with the decrease in bare droplet radius. For O/W Pickering emulsions, the relative viscosity decreases with the increase in contact angle. The W/O Pickering emulsion exhibits an opposite behavior in that the relative viscosity increases with the increase in contact angle. The proposed model describes the experimental viscosity data for Pickering emulsions reasonably well. © 2017 by the author.

Objective: The aim of this study was to review the characteristics and quality of publicly available mHealth apps that check for PDDIs. Methods: Apple App Store and Google Play were searched to identify apps with PDDI functionality. The apps general and feature characteristics were extracted. The Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) was used to assess the quality. Results: A total of 23 apps were included for the review12 from Apple App Store and 11 from Google Play.

The current study examined whether recent increases in levels of the TSNA NNK [4-(methylnitrosamino-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone] in Canadian cigarettes translated into differences in exposure among Canadian tobacco users. Methods: Nationally representative data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) were used to measure levels of total urinary NNAL [4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol], a metabolite of the TSNA NNK, among tobacco users. Data from CHMS Cycle 3 (2012-13) were used to examine NNAL, and linear regression was used to examine predictors. Data from CHMS Cycle 1 (2007-09) and Cycle 3 (2012-13) were used to examine changes in NNAL over time. Results: From 2007-2009 through 2012-2013, levels of creatinine-corrected NNAL increased by 64% (P< 0.0001). Levels of NNAL in 2012-2013 were higher among older respondents (P = 0.04), among females (P = 0.03), among respondents identifying as ""white"" and ""Aboriginal"" (P< 0.0001), and among those with greater daily cigarette consumption (P < 0.001), as well as greater levels of urinary free cotinine (P < 0.0001) and urinary creatinine (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The findings indicate that exposure to the TSNA NNK among Canadian tobacco users has increased considerably from 2007-2009 through 2012-2013, in parallel to changes in TSNA levels in Canadian cigarettes. In the absence of epidemiologic data, it is unclear whether this change translates into increased risk.

Until recently, kinematic examination of motor control has been limited to studies conducted in traditional research laboratories because motion capture equipment used for data collection is not easily portable and expensive. A recently developed markerless system, the Leap Motion Controller (LMC), is a portable and inexpensive tracking device that allows recording of 3D hand and finger position. The main goal of this study was to assess the concurrent reliability and validity of the LMC as compared to the Optotrak, a criterion-standard motion capture system, for measures of temporal accuracy and peak velocity during the performance of upper limb, visually-guided movements. In experiment 1, 14 participants executed aiming movements to visual targets presented on a computer monitor. Bland-Altman analysis was conducted to assess the validity and limits of agreement for measures of temporal accuracy (movement time, duration of deceleration interval), peak velocity, and spatial accuracy (endpoint accuracy). In addition, a one-sample t-test was used to test the hypothesis that the error difference between measures obtained from Optotrak and LMC is zero. In experiment 2, 15 participants performed a Fitts type aiming task in order to assess whether the LMC is capable of assessing a well-known speed-accuracy trade-off relationship. Experiment 3 assessed the temporal coordination pattern during the performance of a sequence consisting of a reaching, grasping, and placement task in 15 participants. Results from the t-test showed that the error difference in temporal measures was significantly different from zero. Based on the results from the 3 experiments, the average temporal error in movement time was 40±44 ms, and the error in peak velocity was 0.024±0.103 m/s. The limits of agreement between the LMC and Optotrak for spatial accuracy measures ranged between 25 cm. Although the LMC system is a low-cost, highly portable system, which could facilitate collection of kinematic data outside of the traditional laboratory settings, the temporal and spatial errors may limit the use of the device in some settings. © 2018 Niechwiej-Szwedo et al.

Previously, such changes in the retina were assessed separately with different methods in clinical studies and animal models. In this study, we used a combined OCT+ ERG system in combination with Doppler OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA) imaging protocols, in order to evaluate simultaneously and correlate changes in the retinal morphology, the retinal functional response to visual stimulation, and the retinal blood flow/ blood perfusion, associated with IOP elevation to ischemic and non-ischemic levels in rats. Results from this study suggest that the inner retina responds faster to IOP elevation to levels greater than 30 mmHg with significant reduction of the total retinal blood flow (TRBF), decrease of the capillaries perfusion and reduction of the ON bipolar cells contribution to the ERG traces. Furthermore, this study showed that ischemic levels of IOP elevation cause an additional significant decrease in the ERG photoreceptor response in the posterior retina. Thirty minutes after IOP normalization, retinal morphology, blood flow and blood perfusion recovered to baseline values, while retinal function did not recover completely. © 2018 Tan et al.

A paucity of research has examined how the unique presentation of near-misses and the use of a stop button in multiline slot machines impact erroneous cognitions related to the perception of skill and agency during play. Our goal therefore was to determine the prevalence of erroneous cognitions pertaining to near-miss outcomes and the usage of a stop button and then to see whether the stop button affected players experiences of winning, losing and near-miss outcomes. We recruited 132 gamblers from a casino in Ontario. They played two versions of a slot machine simulator: one with a stop button and one without a stop button. We measured players arousal [skin conductance responses (SCRs), pressure on the spin-button), and behavioural responses (post-reinforcement pauses (PRPs)] to wins, losses and near-misses during play. We predicted more robust physiological SCRs and longer PRPs to wins in the stop button game. We also predicted that near-misses encountered in the stop button game would trigger greater levels of arousal and frustration in players, as indexed by larger SCRs, and greater force applied to the spin button to initiate the next spin. Erroneous cognitions pertaining to the stop button and near-misses respectively were assessed following play. Results showed that a small but meaningful percentage of players held erroneous cognitions about the stop button (13.6%) and near-misses (16%). Players depressed the spin button harder, and had larger SCRs for all outcomes when using the stop button. Players also paused longer for near-misses in the game involving the stop button. Our findings converge to suggest that the stop button encourages an erroneous perception of skill in some players, and consequentially impacts how such players perceive their outcomes in multiline slot machines. © 2017, The Author(s).",Cognitive biases; Erroneous cognitions; Frustration; Gambling; Illusion of control; Near-misses; Stop button; Structural game features,"addiction; adult; aged; arousal; cognitive defect; depression; female; frustration; gambling; human; male; middle aged; Ontario; physiology; psychology; reinforcement; reward; very elderly; video game; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arousal; Behavior, Addictive; Cognition Disorders; Depression; Female; Frustration; Gambling; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Reinforcement (Psychology); Reward; Video Games; Young Adult",,Springer New York LLC,10505350,,JERSE,28702882,English,J.

An LDW occurs when a player gains credits on a spin, but fewer credits than their original wager (e.g. 15-cent gain on a 20-cent wager). These outcomes alter the gamblers play experience by providing frequent, albeit smaller, credit gains throughout a playing session that are in fact net losses. Despite this negative overall value, research has shown that players physiologically respond to LDWs as if they are wins, not losses. These outcomes also create a smoother experience for the player that seems to promote a highly absorbing, flow-like state that we have called dark flow. Past research has indicated that there may be a relationship between problem gambling status and dark flow, as well as between dark flow, depression, and gambling expectancies. In this study, we sought to further understand these relationships, while examining the influence of LDWs on game preference in the context of single versus multiline slots play. We used a realistic slot machine simulator equipped with a force transducer to measure how hard players pressed the spin button following different outcomes. This measure of arousal showed that LDWs were treated similarly to small wins. Participants overwhelmingly preferred the multiline game and experienced more positive affect while playing it, compared to the single-line game. Problem gambling severity index scores were related to dark flow in both games, but this relationship was stronger for the multiline game. Additionally, depression symptomatology and dark flow were strongly correlated in the multiline game, with significant relationships between depression and gambling expectancy, and gambling expectancy and dark flow ratings also emerging. © 2017, The Author(s).",Dark flow; Depression; Problem gambling; Slot machines,"addiction; adult; arousal; depression; female; gambling; human; learning; male; psychology; reinforcement; reward; Adult; Arousal; Behavior, Addictive; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Female; Gambling; Humans; Learning; Male; Reinforcement (Psychology); Reward",,Springer New York LLC,10505350,,JERSE,28589480,English,J.

Methods: Four silicone hydrogel (SH) CLs (balafilcon A, senofilcon A, lotrafilcon B, comfilcon B) and four conventional hydrogel (CH) CLs (nesofilcon A, hilafilcon B, nelfilcon A, etafilcon A) were evaluated. The drugs studied were natamycin, moxifloxacin, timolol maleate, and ketotifen fumarate. For drug incubation, three CLs of each type were placed in 1 mL of 1 mg/mL drug-loading solution for 24 hours. The lenses were then extracted in 2 mL methanol for 2 hours. This process was repeated to obtain a total of three extraction cycles. Detection of natamycin, moxifloxacin, ketotifen fumarate, and timolol maleate were measured by absorbance at 305, 287, 297, and 295 nm, respectively. Results: The majority of the drugs were extracted after the first extraction cycle (P < 0.001). For moxifloxacin and timolol, CH CLs had higher drug uptake than SH CLs (P < 0.05). There were no differences in drug uptake between CH CLs and SH CLs for natamycin and ketotifen (P > 0.05). Conclusions: This study provides a simple approach to determine drug uptake into CLs. This method can also be modified, such as changing the extraction time, extraction cycles, or extraction solvent to better suit other drugs and CL combinations. Translational Relevance: There is considerable interest in using CLs for ocular drug delivery. Accurately quantifying drug uptake on CLs has been a challenge. Hence, this study provides a simple method to quantify drug uptake in CLs. © 2018 The Authors.",Contact lens; Drug delivery; Drug uptake; Ketotifen fumarate; Moxifloxacin; Natamycin; Timolol maleate,balafilcon A; comfilcon B; copolymer; etafilcon A; hilafilcon B; ketotifen fumarate; lotrafilcon B; moxifloxacin; natamycin; nelfilcon A; nesofilcon A; senofilcon A; timolol; timolol maleate; unclassified drug; Article; controlled study; drug delivery system; drug uptake; eye surgery; hydrogel; incubation time; spectral sensitivity; ultraviolet spectrophotometry,,Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.,21642591,,,,English,Translational Vis.

The plant microbiome can survive either inside or outside of plant tissues, performing various plant beneficial activities including biocontrol of potential phytopathogens and promotion of plant growth. An important part of the plant microbiome includes plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) that commonly reside in the rhizosphere and phyllosphere, and as endophytic bacteria (inside of plant tissues). As new plant microbiome-manipulating strategies have emerged in recent years, we have critically reviewed relevant literature, chiefly from the last decade. We have analysed and compared the rhizosphere, phyllosphere and endosphere as potential ecosystems for manipulation, in order to improve positive interactions with the plant. In addition, many studies on the bioengineering of the endophyte microbiome and its potential impact on the core microbiome were analysed with respect to five different strategies, including host mediated and multi-generation microbiome selection, inoculation into soil and rhizosphere, inoculations into seeds or seedlings, tissue atomisation and direct injection into tissues or wounds.

This strategy aims at targeting multiple components of this complex disease. Despite the increasing number of drug combinations in use, many of them were empirically found in the clinic, and the molecular mechanisms underlying these drug combinations are often unclear. These challenges call for rational, systematic approaches for drug combination discovery. Although high-throughput screening of single-agent therapeutics has been successfully implemented, it is not feasible to test all possible drug combinations, even for a reduced subset of anticancer drugs. Hence, in vitro and in vivo screening of a large number of drug combinations are not practical. Therefore, devising computational methods to efficiently explore the space of drug combinations and to discover efficacious combinations has attracted a lot of attention from the scientific community in the past few years. Nevertheless, in the absence of consensus regarding the computational approaches used to predict efficacious drug combinations, a plethora of methods, techniques and hypotheses have been developed to date, while the research field lacks an elaborate categorization of the existing computational methods and the available data sources. In this manuscript, we review and categorize the state-of-the-art computational approaches for drug combination prediction, and elaborate on the limitations of these methods and the existing challenges. We also discuss about the recent pan-cancer drug combination data sets and their importance in revising the available methods or developing more performant approaches. © The Author 2016.

This paper presents an object-based and machine learning-based approach for automatic house detection from RGB high-resolution images. The images are first segmented by an algorithm combing a thresholding watershed transformation and hierarchical merging, and then shadows and vegetation are eliminated from the initial segmented regions to generate building candidates. Subsequently, the candidate regions are subjected to feature extraction to generate training data. In order to capture the characteristics of house regions well, we propose two kinds of new features, namely edge regularity indices (ERI) and shadow line indices (SLI). Finally, three classifiers, namely AdaBoost, random forests, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are employed to identify houses from test images and quality assessments are conducted. The experiments show that our method is effective and applicable for house identification. The proposed ERI and SLI features can improve the precision and recall by 5.6% and 11.2%, respectively. © 2018 by the authors.",Building extraction; Classification; Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Machine learning; Object recognition,Adaptive boosting; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision trees; Extraction; Houses; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Object detection; Object recognition; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Automatic building extraction; Building extraction; Hierarchical merging; High resolution image; Precision and recall; Quality assessment; Segmented regions; Watershed transformations; Feature extraction,,MDPI AG,20724292,,,,English,Remote Sens.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044791651,

Sensory mismatch has been thought to lie at the heart of the problem and recent studies have shown that reducing cue mismatch in VR can have a therapeutic effect. Specifically, electrical stimulation of vestibular afferent nerves (galvanic vestibular stimulation; GVS) can reduce simulator sickness in VR. However, GVS poses a risk to certain populations and can also result in negative symptoms in normal, healthy individuals. Here, we tested whether noisy vestibular stimulation through bone-vibration can also reduce symptoms of simulator sickness. We carried out two experiments in which participants performed a spatial navigation task in VR and completed the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire over a series of trials. Experiment 1 was conducted using a high-end projection-based VR display, whereas Experiment 2 involved the use of a consumer head mounted display. During each trial, vestibular stimulation was either: 1) absent; 2) coupled with large angular accelerations of the projection camera; or 3) applied randomly throughout each trial. In half of the trials, participants actively navigated using a motion controller, and in the other half they were moved passively through the environment along pre-recorded motion trajectories. In both experiments we obtained lower simulator sickness scores when vestibular stimulation was coupled with angular accelerations of the camera. This effect was obtained for both active and passive movement control conditions, which did not differ. The results suggest that noisy vestibular stimulation can reduce simulator sickness, and that this effect appears to generalize across VR conditions. We propose further examination of this stimulation technique. © 2018 Weech et al.

This study explores the availability of individual NPS and vendors on the crypto markets and considers whether crypto markets are a reliable platform for the sale of NPS. Data was collected from 22 crypto markets that were accessed through the hidden web using the Onion Router (Tor). Data collection took place bimonthly from October 2015 to October 2016 as part of the CASSANDRA (Computer Assisted Solutions for Studying the Availability aNd DistRibution of novel psychoActive substances) project. In seven snapshots over 12 months, 808 unique vendors were found selling 256 unique NPS. The total number of individual NPS and vendors increased across the data collection period (increase of 93.6% and 71.6%, respectively). Only 24% (n = 61) of the total number of NPS and 4% (n = 31) of vendors appeared in every snapshot over the 12 months, whereas 21% (n = 54) of NPS and 45% (n = 365) of vendors only appeared once throughout the data collection. The individual NPS and vendors did not remain the same over the 12 months. However, the availability of NPS and vendors selling NPS grew.

Understanding the relationship between crime and its surrounding environment reveals possible strategies for reducing crime in a neighborhood. The relationship between vegetation density and crime has long been under debate. The convenience of a road network is another important factor that can influence a criminal's selection of locations. This research is conducted to investigate the correlations between tree coverage and property crime, and road density and property crime in the City of Vancouver. High spatial resolution airborne LiDAR data and road network data collected in 2013 were used to extract tree covered areas for cross-sectional analysis. The independent variables were inserted into Ordinary Least-Squares (OLS) regression, Spatial Lag regression, and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models to examine their relationships to property crime rates. The results of the cross-sectional analysis provide statistical evidence that there are negative correlations between property crime rates and both tree coverage and road density, with the stronger correlations occurring around Downtown Vancouver. © 2018 by the authors.",Crime mapping; Geographically weighted regression; GIS; Road density; Spatial lag; Urban vegetation,,,MDPI AG,22209964,,,,English,ISPRS Int.

Historically, these factors have been difficult to measure in the field, constraining our capacity to observe local patterns of variability. In this paper, we show how remote sensing surveys conducted from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms can be used to map microtopography and depth to water over large areas with good accuracy, paving the way for spatially explicit estimates of CH 4 emissions. This approach enabled us to observefor the first timethe effects of low-impact seismic lines (LIS; petroleum exploration corridors) on surface morphology and CH 4 emissions in a treed-bog ecosystem in northern Alberta, Canada. Through compaction, LIS lines were found to flatten the observed range in microtopographic elevation by 46 cm and decrease mean depth to water by 15.4 cm, compared to surrounding undisturbed conditions. These alterations are projected to increase CH 4 emissions by 20120% relative to undisturbed areas in our study area, which translates to a total rise of 0.0110.027 kg CH 4  day ?1 per linear kilometer of LIS (~2 m wide). The ~16 km of LIS present at our 61 ha study site were predicted to boost CH 4 emissions by 2070 kg between May and September 2016. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

Further discovering their association patterns could reveal subtle family subgroup characteristics. Since aligned residues associations (ARAs) in Aligned Pattern Clusters (APCs) are complex and intertwined due to entangled function, factors, and variance in the source environment, we have recently developed a novel method: Aligned Residue Association Discovery and Disentanglement (ARADD) to solve this problem. ARADD first obtains from an APC an ARA Frequency Matrix and converts it to an adjusted statistical residual vector space (SRV). It then disentangles the SRV into Principal Components (PCs) and Re-projects their vectors to a SRV to reveal succinct orthogonal AR groups. In this study, we applied ARADD to class A scavenger receptors (SR-A), a subclass of a diverse protein family binding to modified lipoproteins with diverse biological functionalities not explicitly known. Our experimental results demonstrated that ARADD can unveil subtle subgroups in sequence segments with diverse functionality and highly variable sequence lengths. We also demonstrated that the ARAs captured in a PositionWeight Matrix or an APC were entangled in biological function and domain location but disentangled by ARADD to reveal different subclasses without knowing their actual occurrence positions. © 2018 by the authors.

This study tested a framework combining two health measures to identify home care recipients at higher risk of long-term care placement or death within one year. Both measures come from the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care (RAI-HC), a standardized comprehensive clinical assessment. Persons scoring high in the Method for Assigning Priority Levels (MAPLe) algorithm and Changes in Health, End-stage disease, Signs and Symptoms (CHESS) scale were at the greatest risk of placement or death and more than twice as likely to experience either outcome earlier than others. The target group was more likely to trigger mood, social relationship, and caregiver distress issues, suggesting mental health and psychosocial interventions might help in addition to medical care and/or personal support services. Home care agencies can use this framework to identify home care patients who may require a more intensive care coordinator approach.

Methods Interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with 15 occupational physicians (OPs). Responses were coded using the TDF and the BCW. Results Key behaviors related to applying TWMs were initiating the process with the employee, making recommendations to the workplace, and following up the process. OP behaviors were influenced by several factors related to personal capability and motivation, and opportunities provided by the physical and social environment. Capability comprised relevant knowledge and skills related to applying TWMs, remembering to initiate TWMS and monitor the process, and being accustomed to reflective practice. Opportunity comprised physical resources (e.g., time, predefined procedures, and availability of modified work at companies), and social pressure from stakeholders. Motivation comprised conceptions of a proper OP role, confidence to carry out TWMs, personal RTW-related goals, beliefs about the outcomes of ones actions, feedback received from earlier cases, and feelings related to applying TWMs. OPs perceived means to target these identified factors were linked to the following BCW intervention functions: education, training, persuasion, environmental restructuring, and enablement. The results suggest that at least these functions should be considered when designing future interventions. Conclusions Our study illustrates how theoretical frameworks TDF and BCW can be utilized in a RTW context to understand which determinants of physicians behavior need to be targeted, and how, to promote desired behaviors. © 2017, The Author(s).",Behavior change; Occupational health services; Physicians; Return to work,behavior change; conception; conceptual framework; education; employee; human; human experiment; memory; motivation; occupational health service; occupational physician; persuasive communication; qualitative research; return to work; skill; social environment; social problem; temporary employment; theoretical model; workplace,,Springer New York LLC,10530487,,JOCTE,,English,J.

Methods Within the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana, costing data were gathered for all inputs related to operating a pediatric cancer unit. Cost and volume data for relevant clinical services (eg, laboratory, pathology, medications) were obtained retrospectively or prospectively. Salaries were determined and multiplied by proportion of time dedicated toward pediatric patients with cancer. Costs associated with inpatient bed use, outpatient clinic use, administrative fees, and overhead were estimated. Costs were summed for a total annual operating cost. Cost-effectiveness was calculated based on annual patients with newly diagnosed disease, survival rates, and life expectancy. Results The Korle Bu Teaching Hospital pediatric cancer unit treats on average 170 new diagnoses annually. Total operating cost was $1.7 million/y. Personnel salaries and operating room costs were the most expensive inputs, contributing 45% and 21% of total costs. Together, medications, imaging, radiation, and pathology services accounted for 7%. The cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted was $1,034, less than the Ghanaian per capita income, and thus considered very cost effective as per WHO-CHOICE methodology. Conclusion To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine institution-level costs and cost-effectiveness of a childhood cancer program in an African setting, demonstrating that operating such a program in this setting is very cost effective. These results will inform national childhood cancer strategies in Africa and other low- and middle-income country settings. © 2018 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",,administrative fee; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cancer radiotherapy; cancer survival; cancer therapy; child; childhood cancer; cost; cost effectiveness analysis; disability-adjusted life year; fee; Ghana; health care cost; hospital bed utilization; hospital cost; human; imaging; income; life expectancy; morbidity; mortality risk; operating cost; operating room cost; outpatient department; overhead cost; pathology; priority journal; program cost effectiveness; prospective study; retrospective study; salary; survival rate,,American Society of Clinical Oncology,23789506,,,,English,J.

Specifically, a stroke increases one's risk for dementia by a factor of two. Thus, stroke survivors represent a target population in need of intervention strategies to promote cognitive function and prevent dementia. The current standard of care in stroke rehabilitation does not adequately address the significant cognitive consequences of stroke, especially for those who are in the chronic phase (ie, >12 months since an index stroke). Two potential intervention strategies are: (1) exercise training and (2) cognitive and social enrichment activities. Methods and analysis The aim of this proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial is to determine whether a 6-month targeted exercise training programme or a 6-month cognitive and social enrichment programme can efficaciously and efficiently improve cognitive function in older adults with chronic stroke compared with a 6-month stretch and tone programme (ie, control). The primary measurement periods will be baseline, month 6 (postintervention) and month 12 (6-month follow-up). The primary outcome measure will be performance on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive-Plus (ADAS-Cog-Plus), a global measure of cognitive performance using multidimensional item response theory to summarise scores from the 13-item ADAS-Cog and other standard cognitive assessments. The primary analysis will compare changes in ADAS-Cog-Plus performance from baseline to month 6. Proof-of-concept outcomes relating to intervention feasibility will be analysed descriptively. The economic evaluation will examine the incremental costs and health outcome benefits generated by both interventions versus the control. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the University of British Columbia's Clinical Research Ethics Board (H13-00715, 26 July 2013). Any modifications to the protocol will require a formal amendment to the protocol and approval by the Research Ethics Board. Outcomes of this randomised controlled trial and the statistical code to generate those outcomes will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals as well as conference presentations.

A secondary aim was to compare the results described in previously published studies using the QOLCE-55 with those obtained using the new brief version. Methods: Data come from 373 children involved in the Health-related Quality of Life in Children with Epilepsy Study, a multicenter prospective cohort study. Item response theory (IRT) methods were used to assess dimensionality and item properties and to guide the selection of items. Replication of results using the brief measure was conducted with multiple regression, multinomial regression, and latent mixture modeling techniques. Results: IRT methods identified a bi-factor graded response model that best fits the data. Thirty-nine items were removed, resulting in a 16-item QOLCE (QOLCE-16) with an equal number of items in all 4 domains of functioning (Cognitive, Emotional, Social, and Physical). Model fit was excellent: Comparative Fit Index = 0.99; Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.99; root mean square error of approximation = 0.052 (90% confidence interval [CI] 0.041-0.064); weighted root mean square = 0.76. Results that were reported previously using the QOLCE-55 and QOLCE-76 were comparable to those generated using the QOLCE-16. Significance: The QOLCE-16 is a multidimensional measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with good psychometric properties and a short-estimated completion time. It is notable that the items were calibrated using multidimensional IRT methods to create a measure that conforms to conventional definitions of HRQoL. The QOLCE-16 is an appropriate measure for both clinicians and researchers wanting to record HRQoL information in children with epilepsy.

Previous studies have identified correlations between electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrum power and a driver's mental states such as vigilance and alertness. Studies have also built classification models that can estimate vigilance state changes based on data collected from drivers. In the present study, we propose a system to detect vigilance level using not only a driver's EEG signals but also driving contexts as inputs. We combined a support vector machine with particle swarm optimization methods to improve classification accuracy. A simulated driving task was conducted to demonstrate the reliability of the proposed system. Twenty participants were assigned a 2-h sustained-attention driving task to identify a lead car's brake events. Our system was able to account for 84.1% of experimental reaction times with 162-ms prediction errors. A newly introduced driving context factor, road curves, improved the prediction accuracy by 2-5% with 30-80 ms smaller errors. These findings demonstrated the potential value of the proposed system for estimating driver vigilance level on a time scale of seconds. © 2018 IEEE.",Driver vigilance; driving context; driving safety; electroencephalogram (EEG); support vector machine (SVM),Behavioral research; Electrophysiology; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Reliability; Support vector machines; Vehicles; Biomedical monitoring; Driver vigilance; driving context; Driving safety; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Roads; Electroencephalography,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,189529,,IEERA,,English,IEEE Trans Reliab,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040043716,

We evaluated various parameters of pheromone-based mating disruption for control of the moths Cydia strobilella and Dioryctria abietella, which are major pests in European Picea abies seed orchards. We applied different types of pheromone dispensers (rubber septa or wax droplets) at different densities and heights, and with different amounts of active components, covering whole orchards or part of an orchard. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated by analysing male captures in pheromone-baited assessment traps, and presence of larvae in cones. A dramatic decrease (94100%) in capture of males in traps occurred in all pheromone-treated plots compared to control plots for both moth species. In contrast, a subsequent reduction in larval numbers in cones was only achieved when wax droplets were used as the dispensing formulation at high density and at the highest pheromone dose tested, and only in half of the trials for each pest species. Electrophysiological recordings using antennae of male C. strobilella indicated elevated pheromone concentrations in a treated plot versus a control plot. Our results show that mating disruption has potential to reduce cone damage in spruce seed orchards caused by C. strobilella and D. abietella, but optimisation of the technique is required to achieve consistent and efficient population suppression of these pests. © 2017, The Author(s).",Cone damage; Lepidoptera; Pest management; Picea; SPLAT,coniferous tree; mating disruption; moth; orchard; pest control; pest damage; pheromone trap; Europe; Cydia strobilella; Dioryctria abietella; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; Picea; Picea abies,,Springer Verlag,16124758,,,,English,J.

We investigate the influence of seasons on populations via a periodically forced predator-prey system with a nonmonotonic functional response. We study four seasonality mechanisms via a continuation technique. When the natural death rate is periodically varied, we get six different bifurcation diagrams corresponding to different bifurcation cases of the unforced system. If the carrying capacity is periodic, two different bifurcation diagrams are obtained. Here we cannot get a ""universal diagram"" like the one in the periodically forced system with monotonic Holling type II functional response; that is, the two elementary seasonality mechanisms have different effects on the population. When both the natural death rate and the carrying capacity are forced with two different seasonality mechanisms, the phenomena that arise are to some extent different. The bifurcation results also show that each seasonality mechanism can display complex dynamics such as multiple attractors including stable cycles of different periods, quasi-periodic solutions, chaos, switching between these attractors and catastrophic transitions. In addition, we give some orbits in phase space and corresponding Poincare sections to illustrate different attractors.",Bifurcation diagram; Complexity; Nonmonotonic functional response; Predator-prey; Seasonal forcing,,,American Institute of Mathematical Sciences,15313492,,,,English,Discrete Contin.

To curb the physical inactivity pandemic, it is time to move beyond traditional approaches and engage citizens by repurposing sedentary behavior (SB)enabling ubiquitous tools (eg, smartphones). Objective: The primary objective of the Saskatchewan, lets move and map our activity (SMART) Study was to develop a mobile and citizen science methodological platform for active living surveillance, knowledge translation, and policy interventions. This methodology paper enumerates the SMART Study platforms conceptualization, design, implementation, data collection procedures, analytical strategies, and potential for informing policy interventions. Methods: This longitudinal investigation was designed to engage participants (ie, citizen scientists) in Regina and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, in four different seasons across 3 years. In spring 2017, pilot data collection was conducted, where 317 adult citizen scientists (?18 years) were recruited in person and online. Citizen scientists used a custom-built smartphone app, Ethica (Ethica Data Services Inc), for 8 consecutive days to provide a complex series of objective and subjective data. Citizen scientists answered a succession of validated surveys that were assigned different smartphone triggering mechanisms (eg, user-triggered and schedule-triggered). The validated surveys captured physical activity (PA), SB, motivation, perception of outdoor and indoor environment, and eudaimonic well-being. Ecological momentary assessments were employed on each day to capture not only PA but also physical and social contexts along with barriers and facilitators of PA, as relayed by citizen scientists using geo-coded pictures and audio files. To obtain a comprehensive objective picture of participant location, motion, and compliance, 6 types of sensor-based (eg, global positioning system and accelerometer) data were surveilled for 8 days. Initial descriptive analyses were conducted using geo-coded photographs and audio files. Results: Pictures and audio files (ie, community voices) showed that the barriers and facilitators of active living included intrinsic or extrinsic motivations, social contexts, and outdoor or indoor environment, with pets and favorable urban design featuring as the predominant facilitators, and work-related screen time proving to be the primary barrier. Conclusions: The preliminary pilot results show the flexibility of the SMART Study surveillance platform in identifying and addressing limitations based on empirical evidence. The results also show the successful implementation of a platform that engages participants to catalyze policy interventions. Although SMART Study is currently geared toward surveillance, using the same platform, active living interventions could be remotely implemented. SMART Study is the first mobile, citizen science surveillance platform utilizing a rigorous, longitudinal, and mixed-methods investigation to temporally capture behavioral data for knowledge translation and policy interventions. ©Tarun Reddy Katapally, Jasmin Bhawra, Scott T Leatherdale, Leah Ferguson, Justin Longo, Daniel Rainham, Richard Larouche, Nathaniel Osgood.",,,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,14388871,,,,English,J.

Many diverse environmental indicators, including agricultural environmental indicators, are currently in use or being developed. This special collection of technical papers expands on the peer-reviewed literature on environmental indicators and their application to important current issues in the following areas: (i) model-derived indicators to indicate phosphorus losses from arable land to surface runoff and subsurface drainage, (ii) glutathione-ascorbate cycle-related antioxidants as early-warning bioindicators of polybrominated diphenyl ether toxicity in mangroves, and (iii) assessing the effectiveness of using organic matrix biobeds to limit herbicide dissipation from agricultural fields, thereby controlling on-farm point-source pollution. This introductory review also provides an overview of environmental indicators, mainly for agriculture, with examples related to the quality of the agricultural soil-water-air continuum and the application of model-derived indicators. Current knowledge gaps and future lines of investigation are also discussed. It appears that environmental indicators, particularly those for agriculture, work efficiently at the field, catchment, and local scales and serve as valuable metrics of system functioning and response; however, these indicators need to be refined or further developed to comprehensively meet community expectations in terms of providing a consistent picture of relevant issues and/or allowing comparisons to be made nationally or internationally. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.",,Agriculture; Air quality; Catchments; Environmental management; Groundwater flow; Soil moisture; Agricultural fields; Agricultural soils; Environmental change; Environmental indicators; Environmental performance; Point source pollution; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Subsurface drainages; Agricultural runoff; ascorbic acid; glutathione; herbicide; organic carbon; phosphorus; polybrominated diphenyl ether; soil organic matter; water; agricultural land; agriculture; air quality; arable land; Article; biodiversity; catchment; climate change; ecotoxicity; energy resource; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; mangrove; nonhuman; ozone layer; pollution; runoff; soil quality; statistical model; water quality; air pollution; analysis; pollutant; soil; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Herbicides; Phosphorus; Soil; Water,,ASA/CSSA/SSSA,472425,,JEVQA,29634786,English,J.

Methods We followed a systematic review process developed by the Institute for Work & Health and an adapted best evidence synthesis that ranked evidence as strong, moderate, limited, or insufficient. Results Seven electronic databases were searched from January 1990 until April 2015, yielding 8898 non-duplicate references. Evidence from 36 medium and high quality studies were synthesized on 12 different intervention categories across three broad domains: health-focused, service coordination, and work modification interventions. There was strong evidence that duration away from work from both MSK or pain-related conditions and MH conditions were significantly reduced by multi-domain interventions encompassing at least two of the three domains. There was moderate evidence that these multi-domain interventions had a positive impact on cost outcomes. There was strong evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy interventions that do not also include workplace modifications or service coordination components are not effective in helping workers with MH conditions in RTW. Evidence for the effectiveness of other single-domain interventions was mixed, with some studies reporting positive effects and others reporting no effects on lost time and work functioning. Conclusions While there is substantial research literature focused on RTW, there are only a small number of quality workplace-based RTW intervention studies that involve workers with MSK or pain-related conditions and MH conditions. We recommend implementing multi-domain interventions (i.e. with healthcare provision, service coordination, and work accommodation components) to help reduce lost time for MSK or pain-related conditions and MH conditions. Practitioners should also consider implementing these programs to help improve work functioning and reduce costs associated with work disability. © 2017, The Author(s).",Mental health; Musculoskeletal pain; Program effectiveness; Return to work; Systematic review; Workplace,,,Springer New York LLC,10530487,,JOCTE,,English,J.

A scenario is presented using representatives of many of the types of chemicals that are treated domestically. Predicted environmental chemical concentrations are based on reported loading rates and routine removal rates for 3 types of treatment: trickling filter, activated sludge secondary treatment, and activated sludge plus advanced oxidation process as well as instream effluent dilution. In tier I, predicted effluent concentrations were compared with the lowest predicted-no-effect concentration (PNEC) obtained from the literature using safety factors as needed. A cumulative risk characterization ratio (cumRCR) < 1.0 indicates that risk is unlikely and no further action is needed. Otherwise, a tier 2 assessment is used, in which PNECs are based on trophic level. If tier 2 indicates a possible risk, then a retrospective assessment is recommended. In tier 1, the cumRCR was > 1.0 for all 3 treatment types in our scenario, even though no chemical exceeded a hazard quotient of 1.0 in activated sludge or advanced oxidation process. In tier 2, activated sludge yielded a lower cumRCR than trickling filter because of higher removal rates, and the cumRCR in the advanced oxidation process was << 1.0. Based on the maximum cumulative risk ratio (MCR), more than one-third of the predicted risk was accounted for by one chemical, and at least 90% was accounted for by 3 chemicals, indicating that few chemicals influenced the mixture risk in our scenario. We show how a retrospective assessment can test whether certain chemicals hypothesized as potential drivers in the prospective assessment could have, or are having, deleterious effects on aquatic life.

Moreover, it focused on the longterm outcomes of respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus infections in prematurely born infants and emphasised the necessity for the development of relevant preventative strategies. Other topics that were covered included the vaccination policy in relation to the migration crisis, mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B and C viruses, vaccination against human papilloma viruses in boys and advances on intranasal live-attenuated vaccination against influenza. Emphasis was also given to the role of probiotics in the management of viral infections in childhood, the potential association between viral infections and the pathogenesis of asthma, fetal and neonatal brain imaging and the paediatric intensive care of children with central nervous system viral infections. Moreover, an interesting overview of the viral causes of perinatal mortality in ancient Greece was given, where recent archaeological findings from the Athenian Agora's bone well were presented.

Wills Physics Laboratory, University of Bristol, Tyndall Ave, Bristol, BS8 1TL, United Kingdom","We use 2.0 Msec of Chandra observations to investigate the cocoon shocks of Cygnus A and some implications for its lobes and jet. Measured shock Mach numbers vary in the range 1.18-1.66 around the cocoon. We estimate a total outburst energy of ? 4.7 × 1060 erg, with an age of ? 2 × 107. The average postshock pressure is found to be 8.6 ± 0.3 × 10-10 erg cm-3, which agrees with the average pressure of the thin rim of compressed gas between the radio lobes and shocks, as determined from X-ray spectra. However, average rim pressures are found to be lower in the western lobe than in the eastern lobe by ?20%. Pressure estimates for hotspots A and D from synchrotron self-Compton models imply that each jet exerts a ram pressure ?3 times its static pressure, consistent with the positions of the hotspots moving about on the cocoon shock over time. A steady, one-dimensional flow model is used to estimate jet properties, finding mildly relativistic flow speeds within the allowed parameter range. Models in which the jet carries a negligible flux of rest mass are consistent with the observed properties of the jets and hotspots. This favors the jets being light, implying that the kinetic power and momentum flux are carried primarily by the internal energy of the jet plasma rather than by its rest mass. © 2018.

However, most genetic studies to date have focused on case-control studies of late AMD (choroidal neovascularization or geographic atrophy). The genetic influences on disease progression are largely unexplored. We assembled unique resources to perform a genome-wide bivariate time-to-event analysis to test for association of time-to-late-AMD with ±9 million variants on 2721 Caucasians from a large multi-center randomized clinical trial, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide association study of disease progression (bivariate survival outcome) in AMD genetic studies, thus providing novel insights to AMD genetics. We used a robust Cox proportional hazards model to appropriately account for between-eye correlation when analyzing the progression time in the two eyes of each participant. We identified four previously reported susceptibility loci showing genome-wide significant association with AMD progression: ARMS2-HTRA1 (P=8.1 x 10 -43 ), CFH (P = 3.5 x 10 -37 ), C2-CFB-SKIV2L (P = 8.1 x 10 -10 ) and C3 (P = 1.2 x 10 -9 ). Furthermore, we detected association of rs58978565 near TNR (P = 2.3 x 10 -8 ), rs28368872 near ATF7IP2 (P = 2.9 x 10 -8 ) and rs142450006 near MMP9 (P = 0.0006) with progression to choroidal neovascularization but not geographic atrophy. Secondary analysis limited to 34 reported risk variants revealed that LIPC and CTRB2-CTRB1 were also associated with AMD progression (P &lt; 0.0015). Our genome-wide analysis thus expands the genetics in both development and progression of AMD and should assist in early identification of high risk individuals. © The Author(s) 2018.

Methods: ASCO convened a multidisciplinary, multinational panel of experts in medical oncology, family medicine, radiation oncology, hematology/oncology, palliative and/or hospice care, pain and/or symptom management, patient advocacy, public health, and health economics. Guideline development involved a systematic literature review, a modified ADAPTE process, and a formal consensus-based process with the Expert Panel and additional experts (consensus ratings group). Results: The systematic review included 48 full-text publications regarding palliative care in resource-constrained settings, along with cost-effectiveness analyses; the evidence for many clinical questions was limited. These provided indirect evidence to inform the formal consensus process, which resulted in agreement of ? 75% (by consensus ratings group including Expert Panel). Recommendations The recommendations help define the models of care, staffing requirements, and roles and training needs of team members in a variety of resource settings for palliative care. Recommendations also outline the standards for provision of psychosocial support, spiritual care, and opioid analgesics, which can be particularly challenging and often overlooked in resource-constrained settings. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/resource-stratified-guidelines. Recommendations: It is the view of ASCO that health care providers and health care system decision makers should be guided by the recommendations for the highest stratum of resources available. The guideline is intended to complement but not replace local guidelines. © 2018 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",,opiate; Article; attitude to health; cancer pain; cancer palliative therapy; caregiver; clinical decision making; conflict of interest; consensus; cost effectiveness analysis; global health; health care personnel; health care system; health economics; human; malignant neoplasm; medical education; medical expert; medical society; patient advocacy; patient counseling; practice guideline; priority journal; psychosocial care; public health; skill; social work; spiritual care; systematic review,,American Society of Clinical Oncology,23789506,,,,English,J.

Using a new method that incorporates average Hamiltonian theory into optimal control pulse engineering, we demonstrate NMR pulses that achieve high-fidelity quantum control of nuclear spins in nanometer-scale ensembles. We apply this capability to perform dynamical decoupling experiments that achieve a factor of 500 reduction of the proton-spin resonance linewidth in a (50-nm)3 volume of polystyrene.

While previous scholars have emphasized the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in facilitating social change, they have not provided a nuanced assessment of NGOs' different roles. We use the Poverty and Employment Precarity in Southern Ontario (PEPSO) research partnership as a study case and explore NGO partners' different roles in a large cross-sector social partnership (CSSP). By interviewing 12 NGO partners and 4 non-NGO partners involved in the PEPSO research partnership, our research results show that NGOs primarily have 10 roles in a CSSP. They include enabling roles such as consultant, capacity builder, analyst, and funder; coordinating roles such as broker and communicator; and facilitating roles such as initiator, leader, advocate, and monitor. These roles allow NGOs to fulfil their duties to make substantial contributions to a CSSP. © 2018 by the authors.",Broker; Cross-sector social partnerships; Enabler; Facilitator; NGOs; Roles of non-governmental organizations; SDG #17; SDG #8; Social change; Sustainable development goals,environmental issue; nongovernmental organization; partnership approach; research work; social change; social participation; sustainable development; Canada; Ontario [Canada],,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042418956,

However, silicon-based anode materials usually suffer from large volume change during the charge and discharge process, leading to subsequent pulverization of silicon, loss of electric contact, and continuous side reactions. These transformations cause poor cycle life and hinder the wide commercialization of silicon for LIBs. The lithiation and delithiation behaviors, and the interphase reaction mechanisms, are progressively studied and understood. Various nanostructured silicon anodes are reported to exhibit both superior specific capacity and cycle life compared to commercial carbon-based anodes. However, some practical issues with nanostructured silicon cannot be ignored, and must be addressed if it is to be widely used in commercial LIBs. This Review outlines major impactful work on silicon-based anodes, and the most recent research directions in this field, specifically, the engineering of silicon architectures, the construction of silicon-based composites, and other performance-enhancement studies including electrolytes and binders. The burgeoning research efforts in the development of practical silicon electrodes, and full-cell silicon-based LIBs are specially stressed, which are key to the successful commercialization of silicon anodes, and large-scale deployment of next-generation high energy density LIBs. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Plant-associated bacterial communities impact plant growth and development, both negatively (pathogens) and positively (plant-growth promoting and symbiotic bacteria). Some members of the plant-associated bacterial community possess the ability to modulate plant ACC and ethylene levels and, subsequently, modify plant defense responses, symbiotic programs and overall plant development. In this work, we review and discuss the role of ethylene and ACC in several aspects of plant-bacterial interactions.

However, experimental evidence demonstrates that a significant portion (10-50%) of subjects are BCI-inefficient users (accuracy less than 70%). Thus, predicting BCI performance prior to clinical BCI usage would facilitate the selection of suitable end-users and improve the efficiency of stroke rehabilitation. In the current study, we proposed two physiological variables, i.e., laterality index (LI) and cortical activation strength (CAS), to predict MI-BCI performance. Twenty-four stroke patients and 10 healthy subjects were recruited for this study. Each subject was required to perform two blocks of left- and right-hand MI tasks. Linear regression analyses were performed between the BCI accuracies and two physiological predictors. Here, the predictors were calculated from the electroencephalography (EEG) signals during paretic hand MI tasks (5 trials; approximately 1 min). LI values exhibited a statistically significant correlation with two-class BCI (left vs. right) performance (r = -0.732, p < 0.001), and CAS values exhibited a statistically significant correlation with brain-switch BCI (task vs. idle) performance (r = 0.641, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the BCI-inefficient users were successfully recognized with a sensitivity of 88.2% and a specificity of 85.7% in the two-class BCI. The brain-switch BCI achieved a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 87.5% in the discrimination of BCI-inefficient users. These results demonstrated that the proposed BCI predictors were promising to promote the BCI usage in stroke rehabilitation and contribute to a better understanding of the BCI-inefficiency phenomenon in stroke patients. © 2018 Shu, Chen, Yao, Sheng, Zhang, Jiang, Jia and Zhu.",BCI-inefficiency; Brain-computer interface (BCI); Motor imagery (MI); Sensori-motor rhythm (SMR); Stroke rehabilitation,adult; article; brain computer interface; brain cortex; clinical article; diagnostic test accuracy study; diencephalon; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; female; hand; hemispheric dominance; human; imagery; linear regression analysis; male; rhythm; stroke patient; stroke rehabilitation,,Frontiers Media S.A.,16624548,,,,English,Front.

In this work, mathematical models and computational simulations were employed to investigate the effect of binding components present in complex samples on the recovery of small molecules varying in logP for extractions carried out using the direct immersion approach. The presented findings corroborate that the studied approach indeed enables the extraction of both polar and nonpolar analytes from complex matrices, provided a suitable sorbent is employed. Further results indicated that, in certain cases, the kinetics of extraction of a given analyte in its free form might be dependent on the desorption kinetics of their bound form from matrix components, which might lower total recoveries of analytes with high affinity for the matrix.

Here, CLASS-CTEM is coupled to Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)'s weather and greenhouse gas forecast model (GEM-MACH-GHG) to consistently model atmosphere-land exchange of CO2. The coupling between the land and the atmospheric transport model ensures consistency between meteorological forcing of CO2 fluxes and CO2 transport. The procedure used to spin up carbon pools for CLASS-CTEM for multi-decadal simulations needed to be significantly altered to deal with the limited availability of consistent meteorological information from a constantly changing operational environment in the GEM-MACH-GHG model. Despite the limitations in the spin-up procedure, the simulated fluxes obtained by driving the CLASS-CTEM model with meteorological forcing from GEM-MACH-GHG were comparable to those obtained from CLASS-CTEM when it is driven with standard meteorological forcing from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) combined with reanalysis fields from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to form CRU-NCEP dataset. This is due to the similarity of the two meteorological datasets in terms of temperature and radiation. However, notable discrepancies in the seasonal variation and spatial patterns of precipitation estimates, especially in the tropics, were reflected in the estimated carbon fluxes, as they significantly affected the magnitude of the vegetation productivity and, to a lesser extent, the seasonal variations in carbon fluxes. Nevertheless, the simulated fluxes based on the meteorological forcing from the GEM-MACH-GHG model are consistent to some extent with other estimates from bottom-up or top-down approaches. Indeed, when simulated fluxes obtained by driving the CLASS-CTEM model with meteorological data from the GEM-MACH-GHG model are used as prior estimates for an atmospheric CO2 inversion analysis using the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem model, the retrieved CO2 flux estimates are comparable to those obtained from other systems in terms of the global budget and the total flux estimates for the northern extratropical regions, which have good observational coverage. In data-poor regions, as expected, differences in the retrieved fluxes due to the prior fluxes become apparent. Coupling CLASS-CTEM into the Environment Canada Carbon Assimilation System (EC-CAS) is considered an important step toward understanding how meteorological uncertainties affect both CO2 flux estimates and modeled atmospheric transport. Ultimately, such an approach will provide more direct feedback to the CLASS-CTEM developers and thus help to improve the performance of CLASS-CTEM by identifying the model limitations based on atmospheric constraints. © Author(s) 2018.",,,,Copernicus GmbH,1991959X,,,,English,Geoscientific Model Dev.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042321625,

In this study, observed spatial patterns of actual evapotranspiration (AET) are utilised for spatial model calibration tailored to target the pattern performance of the model. The proposed calibration framework combines temporally aggregated observed spatial patterns with a new spatial performance metric and a flexible spatial parameterisation scheme. The mesoscale hydrologic model (mHM) is used to simulate streamflow and AET and has been selected due to its soil parameter distribution approach based on pedo-transfer functions and the build in multi-scale parameter regionalisation. In addition two new spatial parameter distribution options have been incorporated in the model in order to increase the flexibility of root fraction coefficient and potential evapotranspiration correction parameterisations, based on soil type and vegetation density. These parameterisations are utilised as they are most relevant for simulated AET patterns from the hydrologic model. Due to the fundamental challenges encountered when evaluating spatial pattern performance using standard metrics, we developed a simple but highly discriminative spatial metric, i.e. one comprised of three easily interpretable components measuring co-location, variation and distribution of the spatial data. The study shows that with flexible spatial model parameterisation used in combination with the appropriate objective functions, the simulated spatial patterns of actual evapotranspiration become substantially more similar to the satellite-based estimates. Overall 26 parameters are identified for calibration through a sequential screening approach based on a combination of streamflow and spatial pattern metrics. The robustness of the calibrations is tested using an ensemble of nine calibrations based on different seed numbers using the shuffled complex evolution optimiser. The calibration results reveal a limited trade-off between streamflow dynamics and spatial patterns illustrating the benefit of combining separate observation types and objective functions. At the same time, the simulated spatial patterns of AET significantly improved when an objective function based on observed AET patterns and a novel spatial performance metric compared to traditional streamflow-only calibration were included. Since the overall water balance is usually a crucial goal in hydrologic modelling, spatial-pattern-oriented optimisation should always be accompanied by traditional discharge measurements. In such a multi-objective framework, the current study promotes the use of a novel bias-insensitive spatial pattern metric, which exploits the key information contained in the observed patterns while allowing the water balance to be informed by discharge observations. © Author(s) 2018.",,Economic and social effects; Evapotranspiration; Function evaluation; Parameterization; Satellites; Stream flow; Actual evapotranspiration; Discharge measurements; Discharge observations; Distributed hydrologic model; Pedo-transfer functions; Potential evapotranspiration; Satellite based Earth observation; Shuffled Complex Evolution; Spatial distribution; calibration; discharge; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; parameterization; pedotransfer function; performance assessment; satellite data; spatial analysis; streamflow; trade-off,,Copernicus GmbH,10275606,,,,English,Hydrol.

As emerged in the recent picture of top-down multiphase condensation, hot gaseous halos are tightly linked to all other phases in terms of cospatiality and thermodynamics. While hot halos (?10 7 K) are perturbed by subsonic turbulence, warm (?10 4 K) ionized and neutral filaments condense out of the turbulent eddies. The peaks condense into cold molecular clouds (&lt;100 K) raining in the core via chaotic cold accretion (CCA). We show that all phases are tightly linked in terms of the ensemble (wide-aperture) velocity dispersion along the line of sight. The correlation arises in complementary long-term AGN feedback simulations and high-resolution CCA runs, and is corroborated by the combined Hitomi and new Integral Field Unit measurements in the Perseus cluster. The ensemble multiphase gas distributions (from the UV to the radio band) are characterized by substantial spectral line broadening (? v,los ? 100-200 ) with a mild line shift. On the other hand, pencil-beam detections (as H i absorption against the AGN backlight) sample the small-scale clouds displaying smaller broadening and significant line shifts of up to several 100 (for those falling toward the AGN), with increased scatter due to the turbulence intermittency. We present new ensemble ? v,los of the warm H+[N ii] gas in 72 observed cluster/group cores: the constraints are consistent with the simulations and can be used as robust proxies for the turbulent velocities, in particular for the challenging hot plasma (otherwise requiring extremely long X-ray exposures). Finally, we show that the physically motivated criterion C ? t cool /t eddy ? 1 best traces the condensation extent region and the presence of multiphase gas in observed clusters and groups. The ensemble method can be applied to many available spectroscopic data sets and can substantially advance our understanding of multiphase halos in light of the next-generation multiwavelength missions. © 2018.

Combining in situ rheo-small-angle-neutron-scattering experiments and numerical simulations we show that shear facilitates crystallization of colloidal star polymers in the vicinity of their glass transition. With increasing shear rate well beyond rheological yielding, a transition is found from an initial bcc-dominated structure to an fcc-dominated one. This crystal-to-crystal transition is not accompanied by intermediate melting but occurs via a sudden reorganization of the crystal structure. Our results provide a new avenue to tailor colloidal crystallization and the crystal-to-crystal transition at the molecular level by coupling softness and shear. © 2018 authors.

We tested the performance of three solute transport models, including the classical equilibrium convection-dispersion equation (CDE), a chemical non-equilibrium one-site adsorption model (OSA) and a model to account for physical non-equilibrium, the mobile-immobile (MIM) phases. The selection was motivated by the fact that the applicability of the MIM in peat soils finds a wide consensus. However, results from inverse modeling and a robust statistical evaluation of this peat provide evidence that the measured breakthrough of the conservative tracer, Cl - , could be simulated well using the CDE. Furthermore, the very high Damköhler number (which approaches infinity) suggests instantaneous equilibration between the mobile and immobile phases underscoring the redundancy of the MIM approach for this particular peat. Scanning electron microscope images of the peat show the typical multi-pore size distribution structures have been homogenized sufficiently by decomposition, such that physical non-equilibrium solute transport no longer governs the transport process. This result is corroborated by the fact the soil hydraulic properties were adequately described using a unimodal van Genuchten-Mualem model between saturation and a pressure head of ? -1000cm of water. Hence, MIM was not the most suitable choice, and the long tailing of the Na+ breakthrough curve was caused by chemical non-equilibrium. Successful description was possible using the OSA model. To test our results for the unsaturated case, we conducted an unsaturated steady-state evaporation experiment to drive Na + and Cl - transport. Using the parameterized transport models from the saturated experiments, we could numerically simulate the unsaturated transport using Hydrus-1-D. The simulation showed a good prediction of observed values, confirming the suitability of the parameters for use in a slightly unsaturated transport simulation. The findings improve the understanding of solute redistribution in the constructed fen and imply that MIM should not be automatically assumed for solute transport in peat but rather should be evidence based. © 2018 Author(s).

We assessed air cleaner effectiveness in reducing indoor residential PM2.5 and second hand smoke (SHS) exposures among non-smoking pregnant women in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Methods We randomized 540 participants to an intervention group receiving 1 or 2 HEPA filter air cleaners or a control group receiving no air cleaners. We followed 259 intervention and 253 control participants to the end of pregnancy. We measured one-week indoor residential PM2.5 concentrations in early (~ 11 weeks gestation) and late (~ 31 weeks gestation) pregnancy and collected outdoor PM2.5 data from centrally-located government monitors. We assessed blood cadmium in late pregnancy. Hair nicotine was quantified in a subset (n = 125) to evaluate blood cadmium as a biomarker of SHS exposure. We evaluated air cleaner effectiveness using mixed effects and multiple linear regression models and used stratified models and interaction terms to evaluate potential modifiers of effectiveness. Results The overall geometric mean (GM) one-week outdoor PM2.5 concentration was 47.9 ?g/m3 (95% CI: 44.6, 51.6 ?g/m3), with highest concentrations in winter (118.0 ?g/m3; 110.4, 126.2 ?g/m3). One-week indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations were correlated (r = 0.69). Indoor PM2.5 concentrations were 29% (21, 37%) lower in intervention versus control apartments, with GMs of 17.3 ?g/m3 (15.8, 18.8 ?g/m3) and 24.5 ?g/m3 (22.2, 27.0 ?g/m3), respectively. Air cleaner effectiveness was greater when air cleaners were first deployed (40%; 31, 48%) than after approximately five months of use (15%; 0, 27%). Blood cadmium concentrations were 14% (4, 23%) lower among intervention participants, likely due to reduced SHS exposure. Conclusions Portable HEPA filter air cleaners can lower indoor PM2.5 concentrations and SHS exposures in highly polluted settings. © 2017 The Authors",Cadmium; HEPA; Intervention; PM2.5; RCT; SHS,"Air filters; Bandpass filters; Blood; Cadmium; Housing; Indoor air pollution; Linear regression; Obstetrics; Particles (particulate matter); Regression analysis; Smoke; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); HEPA; Intervention; Multiple linear regression models; PM2.5; PM2.5 concentration; Randomized controlled trial; Second hand tobacco smokes; Air cleaners; cadmium; nicotine; cadmium; concentration (composition); filter; particulate matter; pollution exposure; pregnancy; smoke; tobacco; air quality; Article; blood sampling; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental exposure; female; hair analysis; health impact assessment; heavy metal blood level; human; indoor air pollution; Mongolia; particulate matter; passive smoking; pollution control; pollution monitoring; portable high efficiency particulate air filter; pregnant woman; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; third trimester pregnancy; air filter; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; filtration; maternal exposure; passive smoking; pregnancy; prevention and control; statistics and numerical data; Central Province [Mongolia]; Mongolia; Ulaanbaatar; Nicotiana tabacum; Air Filters; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Female; Filtration; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Mongolia; Pregnancy; Tobacco Smoke Pollution",,Elsevier B.V.,489697,,STEVA,29751442,English,Sci.

However, conventional advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are impractically expensive to treat the volumes of OSPW stockpiled in the Athabasca region. Here we prepared floating photocatalysts (FPCs) by immobilizing TiO2 on glass microbubbles, such that the composite particles float at the air-water interface for passive solar photocatalysis. The FPCs were demonstrated to outperform P25 TiO2 nanoparticles in degrading AEO in raw OSPW under natural sunlight and gentle mixing conditions. The FPCs were also found to be recyclable for multiple uses through simple flotation and skimming. This paper thus demonstrates the concept of a fully passive AOP that may be scalable to oil sands water treatment challenges, achieving efficient NA reduction solely through the energy provided by sunlight and natural mixing processes (wind and waves). © 2018 by the authors.",Naphthenic acids; Oil sands; Passive; Photocatalysis; Solar,Air; Catalysis; Flotation; Mixing; Oil sands; Organic acids; Phase interfaces; Photocatalysis; Sand; Titanium compounds; Titanium dioxide; Water treatment; Advanced oxidation process; Air water interfaces; Composite particles; Naphthenic acid; Oil Sands Process-affected Waters; Passive; Solar; TiO2 nano-particles; Chemicals removal (water treatment); bitumen; carboxylic acid; catalysis; catalyst; immobilization; mixing; oil sand; oxidation; photodegradation; reduction; solar power; water treatment; watershed; Alberta; Athabasca Oil Sands; Canada,,MDPI AG,20734441,,,,English,Water,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042135677,

The recent emergence of high frame rate ultrasound (HiFRUS) is the next step in the quantification of complex blood flow behavior, offering angle-independent, high temporal resolution data in normal physiology and clinical cases. While there are various HiFRUS methods that have been tested and validated in simulations and in complex flow phantoms, there is a need to expand the field into more rigorous in vivo testing for clinical relevance. In this tutorial, we briefly outline the major advances in HiFRUS, and discuss practical considerations of participant preparation, experimental design, and human measurement, while also providing an example of how these frameworks can be immediately applied to in vivo research questions. The considerations put forward in this paper aim to set a realistic framework for research labs which use HiFRUS to commence the collection of human data for basic science, as well as for preliminary clinical research questions. © 2018 by the authors.",High frame rate ultrasound; Human studies; Neurovascular control; Ultrafast ultrasound,,,MDPI AG,20763417,,,,English,Appl.

Here we report that an Enterococcus faecium strain isolated from cow feces carries a BoNT-like toxin, designated BoNT/En. It cleaves both VAMP2 and SNAP-25, proteins that mediate synaptic vesicle exocytosis in neurons, at sites distinct from known BoNT cleavage sites on these two proteins. Comparative genomic analysis determines that the E. faecium strain carrying BoNT/En is a commensal type and that the BoNT/En gene is located within a typical BoNT gene cluster on a 206 kb putatively conjugative plasmid. Although the host species targeted by BoNT/En remains to be determined, these findings establish an extended member of BoNTs and demonstrate the capability of E. faecium, a commensal organism ubiquitous in humans and animals and a leading cause of hospital-acquired multi-drug-resistant (MDR) infections, to horizontally acquire, and possibly disseminate, a unique BoNT gene cluster. Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are potent toxins produced by diverse bacteria in the Clostridium genus. Zhang et al. report that a commensal strain of Enterococcus faecium carries a conjugative plasmid encoding a BoNT-like toxin gene. Thus, a commensal organism can acquire and possibly disseminate BoNT genes. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",botulinum neurotoxin; botulinum toxin; botulism; E. faecium; enterococcus; enterococcus faecium; SNAP-25; SNARE; toxin; VAMP,"bacterial protein; botulinum toxin; botulinum toxin A; complementary DNA; glutathione transferase; proteinase; SNARE protein; sortase; synaptobrevin 2; synaptosomal associated protein 25; urease; botulinum toxin; synaptobrevin 2; synaptosomal associated protein 25; amino acid substitution; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium isolate; brain cell; carboxy terminal sequence; commensal; comparative study; conjugative plasmid; controlled study; DNA replication origin; DNA sequence; Enterococcus faecium; exocytosis; gastrocnemius muscle; gene cluster; gene insertion sequence; gene location; genomics; HEK293 cell line; human; human cell; mouse; nonhuman; open reading frame; priority journal; protein cleavage; rat; sequence alignment; synapse vesicle; toxin-antitoxin system; transient transfection; type IV secretion system; animal; bacterial genome; bovine; cell line; Enterococcus faecium; feces; female; genetics; isolation and purification; male; metabolism; microbiology; multigene family; nerve cell; pathogenicity; pathology; plasmid; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Botulinum Toxins; Cattle; Cell Line; Enterococcus faecium; Feces; Female; Genome, Bacterial; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Male; Mice; Multigene Family; Neurons; Plasmids; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Synaptosomal-Associated Protein 25; Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein 2",,Cell Press,19313128,,,29396040,English,Cell Host and Microbe,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040989826,

Furthermore, expressions for the soil hydraulic conductivity curves associated with parametric retention functions can behave unrealistically near saturation.

Only 3 of the 18 tested parameterizations met this criterion without restrictions on the parameters of a popular conductivity curve parameterization. A fourth required one parameter to be fixed. <br><br> We estimated parameters by shuffled complex evolution (SCE) with the objective function tailored to various observation methods used to obtain retention curve data. We fitted the four parameterizations with physically plausible conductivities as well as the most widely used parameterization.

Based on the state-of-the-art drone-to-user and drone-to-base station (D2B) channel models, we first analyze the user coverage and the D2B backhaul connection features of drone-cells. We then formulate the 3-D drone-cell deployment problem with the objective of maximizing the user coverage while maintaining D2B link qualities, for a given number of drone cells being deployed. To solve the problem, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is leveraged for its low computational cost and unique features suiting the spatial deployment of drone-cells. We propose a per-drone iterated PSO (DI-PSO) algorithm that optimizes drone-cell deployments for different drone-cell numbers, and prevents the drawbacks of the pure PSO-based algorithm derived from related works. Simulations show that the DI-PSO algorithm can achieve higher coverage ratio with less complexity comparing to the pure PSO-based algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.",D2B; D2U; Drone; drone communication; particle swarm optimization; radio access networks,Cells; Cytology; Drones; Electronic mail; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radio; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Algorithm design and analysis; Cell deployment; Computational costs; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Radio access networks; State of the art; Three-dimensional display; Unique features; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV),,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041850609,

In this work, we conduct investigations to elucidate the role of PEI in enhancing QDLED efficiency. Spectroscopic studies of devices with a phosphorescent marking layer reveal that the PEI layer increases, rather than decreases, the generation of excitons within the hole transporting layer indicative of increased electron injection. Delayed electroluminescence measurements corroborate these findings as devices with a PEI interlayer exhibit a greater concentration of excess mobile and trapped electrons. We attribute the improvement in efficiency despite the ensuing increased charge imbalance within the devices to the passivation of exciton quenching at the ZnO/QD interface. The increase in efficiency predominantly occurs over low driving currents which is particularly attractive for the brightness targets of display applications. Furthermore, despite the increased charge imbalance, the PEI passivation layer appears to have little effect on QDLED stability. This shows that excess electrons and Auger quenching by unneutralized electrons are not detrimental to QDLED stability. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Current density; Efficiency; Electrons; Excitons; Light; Light emission; Nanocrystals; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED); Passivation; Quenching; Semiconductor quantum dots; Spectroscopic analysis; Display application; Exciton quenching; Hole transporting layers; Light emitting devices; Low driving currents; Polyethylenimines; Spectroscopic studies; Trapped electrons; Quantum efficiency,,Royal Society of Chemistry,20403364,,,,English,Nanoscale,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041490587,

In each DCE, participants evaluated four or five sets of four inserts, selecting the most and least motivating (DCEs 1 & 3) or helpful (DCE 2) for quitting. Linear mixed models regressed choices on insert and smoker characteristics. For DCE 1, the most motivating messages involved novel disease topics and imagery of younger women. For DCE 2, topics of social support, stress reduction and nicotine replacement therapy were selected as most helpful, with no differences by imagery type. For DCE 3, imagery influenced choices more than topic, with imagery of a family or a mom and baby selected as most motivating. Statistically significant interactions for all three experiments indicated that the influence of imagery type on choices depended on the message topic.

Our aim was to estimate the association between diabetes and infections occurring in primary care. Methods: Using the Newfoundland and Labrador Sentinel of the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network, patients with diabetes ?18 years between 1 January 2008 and 31 March 2013 were included with at least 1-year of follow-up. We randomly matched each patient with diabetes on the date of study entry with up to 8 controls without diabetes. Primary outcome was the occurrence of ?1 primary care physician visits for any infectious disease. Secondary outcomes included primary visits for head & neck, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, skin and soft tissue, musculoskeletal, and viral infections. Using multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis, we measured the independent association between diabetes and the occurrence of infections. Results: We identified 1779 patients with diabetes who were matched to 11,066 patients without diabetes. Patients with diabetes were older, had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, and were more often referred to specialists. After adjusting for potential confounders, patients with diabetes had an increased risk of any infection compared to patients without diabetes (adjusted odds ratio = 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.37). Skin and soft tissue infections had the strongest association, followed by genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and respiratory infections. Diabetes was not associated with head and neck, musculoskeletal, or viral infections.

It also has practical significance for identifying information processing tasks for which those phenomena provide a quantum advantage. Using the framework of generalized noncontextuality as our notion of classicality, we find one such nonclassical feature within the phenomenology of quantum minimum-error state discrimination. Namely, we identify quantitative limits on the success probability for minimum-error state discrimination in any experiment described by a noncontextual ontological model. These constraints constitute noncontextuality inequalities that are violated by quantum theory, and this violation implies a quantum advantage for state discrimination relative to noncontextual models. Furthermore, our noncontextuality inequalities are robust to noise and are operationally formulated, so that any experimental violation of the inequalities is a witness of contextuality, independently of the validity of quantum theory. Along the way, we introduce new methods for analyzing noncontextuality scenarios and demonstrate a tight connection between our minimum-error state discrimination scenario and a Bell scenario. © 2018 authors.

We focus on the common case, wherein the trip duration is more than a single day. Previous efficient algorithms based on greedy heuristics suffer from two problems. First, the itineraries are often unbalanced, with excellent days visiting top attractions followed by days of exclusively lower-quality alternatives. Second, the trips often re-visit neighborhoods repeatedly in order to cover increasingly low-tier points of interest. Our primary technical contribution is an algorithm that addresses both these problems by maximizing the quality of the worst day. We give theoretical results showing that this algorithm's competitive factor is within a factor two of the guarantee of the best available algorithm for a single day, across many variations of the problem. We also give detailed empirical evaluations using two distinct datasets: (a) anonymized Google historical visit data and (b) Foursquare public check-in data. We show first that the overall utility of our itineraries is almost identical to that of algorithms specifically designed to maximize total utility, while the utility of the worst day of our itineraries is roughly twice that obtained from other approaches. We then turn to evaluation based on human raters who score our itineraries only slightly below the itineraries created by human travel experts with deep knowledge of the area. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,Information retrieval; Websites; Competitive factor; Deep knowledge; Empirical evaluations; Greedy heuristics; Points of interest; Technical contribution; Travel itinerary; Trip duration; Data mining,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9.78145E+12,,,English,WSDM - Proc.

Most of the existing evidence base on delirium is derived from studies in the acute in-patient population. We examine the association between clinical characteristics and medication use with the incidence of delirium during the nursing home stay. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of 1571 residents from 12 nursing homes operated by a single care provider in Ontario, Canada. Residents were over the age of 55 and admitted between February 2010 and December 2015 with no baseline delirium and a minimum stay of 180 days. Residents with moderate or worse cognitive impairment at baseline were excluded. The baseline and follow-up characteristics of residents were collected from the Resident Assessment Instrument-Minimal Data Set 2.0 completed at admission and repeated quarterly until death or discharge. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify characteristics and medication use associated with the onset of delirium. Results: The incidence of delirium was 40.4% over the nursing home stay (mean LOS: 32 months). A diagnosis of dementia (OR: 2.54, p <.001), the presence of pain (OR: 1.64, p <.001), and the use of antipsychotics (OR: 1.87, p <.001) were significantly associated with the onset of delirium. Compared to residents who did not develop delirium, residents who developed a delirium had a greater increase in the use of antipsychotics and antidepressants over the nursing home stay. Conclusions: Dementia, the presence of pain, and the use of antipsychotics were associated with the onset of delirium. Pain monitoring and treatment may be important to decrease delirium in nursing homes. Future studies are necessary to examine the prescribing patterns in nursing homes and their association with delirium. © 2018 The Author(s).",Delirium; Nursing homes; Pain,"antidepressant agent; neuroleptic agent; aged; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; comorbidity; delirium; female; home for the aged; human; incidence; long term care; male; nursing home; Ontario; pain; psychology; retrospective study; trends; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antidepressive Agents; Antipsychotic Agents; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Delirium; Female; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Incidence; Long-Term Care; Male; Nursing Homes; Ontario; Pain; Retrospective Studies",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712318,,,29394886,English,BMC Geriatr.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041611419,

Despite this interest, a thorough identification of the specific optical processes responsible for this phenomenon remains to be achieved. We employ controlled in silico experiments to address this enduring open problem. Our experiments, which are supported by measured data available in the scientific literature, are performed using first-principles models of light interaction with human skin and blood. Using this investigation approach, we quantitatively demonstrate that Rayleigh scattering caused by collagen fibrils present in the papillary dermis, a sublayer of the skin, can play a pivotal role in the bluish appearance of veins as suggested by previous works in this area. Moreover, also taking color perception aspects into account, we systematically assess the effects of variations in fibril radius and papillary dermis thickness on the coloration of veins under different illuminants. Notably, this assessment indicates that Rayleigh scattering elicited by reticulin fibrils, another type of fibril found in the papillary dermis, is unlikely to significantly contribute to the bluish appearance of veins. By strengthening the current understanding of light attenuation mechanisms affecting the appearance of skin and blood, our investigation contributes to the development of more effective technologies aimed at the noninvasive measurement of the physiological properties of these tissues. © 2017 The Authors.",blood spectral responses; predictive simulation; Rayleigh scattering; skin spectral responses; tissue optics; vein appearance,Blood; Color vision; Light; Tissue; First principles models; Noninvasive measurements; Physiological properties; Predictive simulations; Scientific literature; Spectral response; Tissue optic; vein appearance; Rayleigh scattering,,SPIE,10833668,,JBOPF,29405048,English,J Biomed Opt,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041461392,

Design A between-group experiment randomly assigned respondents to view one of four energy drink ads (sport-themed or control) and assessed perceptions of the ad. Regression models examined marketing exposure and perceptions. Setting Online survey (2014). Subjects Canadians aged 12-24 years (n 2040) from a commercial panel. Results Overall, 83 % reported ever seeing energy drink ads through at least one channel, including on television (60 %), posters/signs in stores (49 %) and online (44 %).

This has inevitably led to challenges in joining materials where aluminum alloys, magnesium alloys, and steels (i.e. low, medium and ultra-high strength) are combined. Since each of these materials offer varying performance and property advantages for various components, they have been introduced progressively in different locations of new designs. Consequently, these material combinations will inevitably need to be joined, which presents major challenges due to their incompatibility during conventional fusion welding processes used in vehicle manufacture. This paper summarizes recent progress in friction-based techniques for joining dissimilar material combinations, and discusses factors controlling bonding and joint strength. Since friction stirs welding (FSW) and its sub-family do not involve bulk melting of the components (the peak temperature in FSW is about 0.60.95 melting point of materials), it is among most capable welding techniques for joining dissimilar materials. In the automotive industries, the attention and application of FSW has been in three general sets. These include the joining of extruded parts to form larger extrusions the joining of tailor welded blanks, and the joining for various assembly applications. FSW in each of these has diverse advantages and resulting cost reductions. However, cost effective and reliable joints of light weight alloys (i.e. aluminum) and steel will demand significant development and consideration. The purpose of the present review paper is to assess the status of friction-based solid state welding of dissimilar automotive alloys, with specific attention to the automotive industry, future trend, challenges and limitations. The main difference between the FSW of similar and dissimilar alloys is the incoherency in properties across the butting surfaces which has a significant influence on the flow behavior of materials during stirring. © 2018 Karabuk University",Aluminum; Automotive; Dissimilar; Friction welding; Steel; Tailor welded blanks,,,Elsevier B.V.,22150986,,,,English,Eng.

The network was calibrated to fit experimental air-water capillary pressure data collected for carbon fibre paper commonly used as a gas diffusion layer in fuel cells. These materials exhibit unusually strong capillary hysteresis, to the extent that water injection and withdrawal occur at positive and negative capillary pressures, respectively. Without the need to invoke contact angle hysteresis, this capillary behaviour is re-produced when using a pore-scale model based on the curvature of a meniscus passing through the centre of a toroid. The classic Washburn relation was shown to produce erroneous results, and its use is not recommended when modelling fibrous media. The important effect of saturation distribution on the effective diffusivity of the medium was also investigated for both water injection and withdrawal cases. The findings have bearing on the understanding of both capillarity in fibrous media and fuel cell design. © 2017, The Author(s).",Capillary pressure; Fuel cell; Hysteresis; Relative diffusivity,Air; Capillarity; Capillary tubes; Carbon fibers; Diffusion in gases; Hysteresis; Oil well flooding; Water injection; Capillary pressure curves; Contact angle hysteresis; Effective diffusivities; Fuel cell electrodes; Gas diffusion layers; Negative capillary pressure; Relative diffusivity; Saturation distribution; Fuel cells; capillarity; capillary pressure; diffusivity; electrode; fuel cell; hysteresis; porosity; wettability,,Springer Netherlands,1693913,,TPMEE,,English,Transp.

We measured the concentrations of alkali earth metals (Ca, Mg, Ba), metals (Mn, Fe, Al, Co, Cd, Pb, Zn), metalloids (As, Mo) and phosphorus (P) in 165 surface sediment samples from 17 limed lakes, as well as the sediment column and porewater of two lakes chosen from this set. We report that formation of ferromanganese nodules is widespread in limed lakes, and that those nodules are enriched in trace elements, reaching for example 11:500, 908 and 40 ?g g-1 for Ba, Mo and As, respectively. Nodules are more abundant between the littoral and the profundal zones. Intense redox cycling of Fe and Mn at the sediment-water interface has redistributed trace elements in the sediment column. Ba, Co, Mo, Pb and Zn partitioned with Mn (oxy)hydroxides and As and P with Fe (oxy)hydroxides. Fe, Mo, Co and As remobilized to the porewater also diffused downward and were likely sequestrated with sulfides. We conclude that the diagenetic redistribution and partitioning of trace elements onto Fe-Mn nodules, rather than direct inputs from liming, is the cause of the elevated trace element burden in surface sediments. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"aluminum; barium; cadmium; calcium; cobalt; dissolved organic matter; fulvic acid; humic acid; iron; lead; magnesium; manganese; phosphorus; trace element; zinc; calcium derivative; calcium oxide; heavy metal; iron; manganese; oxide; trace element; acidification; Article; complex formation; environmental change; geochemistry; ion chromatography; lake sediment; mass spectrometry; Norway; priority journal; summer; surface property; thermodynamics; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; lake; pH; procedures; sediment; theoretical model; water pollutant; Calcium Compounds; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Iron; Lakes; Manganese; Metals, Heavy; Models, Theoretical; Norway; Oxides; Thermodynamics; Trace Elements; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,Royal Society of Chemistry,20507887,,,29359225,English,Environ.

These studies were undertaken to improve the understanding of how benzene and SXFA mechanistically interact based on their chemistry, information which can be used to more efficiently design polymeric sensing materials. We find that benzene adsorbed onto the OH-groups in SXFA rather than the trifluoro-groups as previously proposed. Specifically, we find that sorption results from electrostatic attraction between the negative benzene ring and the positive hydrogens of the OH-groups of SXFA. © 2018 by the authors.

Low-grade inflammation occurs in OA and correlates with disease severity and progression. Since monocyte development and function is altered by systemic inflammation, we analyzed monocyte numbers and function between individuals with knee OA and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Design: We analyzed markers of soluble and cellular inflammation in peripheral blood of women with knee OA and compared them to healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Soluble inflammatory mediators (TNF, IL-6, IL-10 and CRP) in the serum were measured by high-sensitivity ELISA. Leukocyte numbers, surface expression of monocyte activation markers, and monocyte production of pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF and IL-1?) following stimulation were measured by flow cytometry. Results: Women with knee OA (n = 15) had elevated levels of serum c-reactive protein (CRP) and a lower proportion of circulating monocytes. Monocytes from OA participants had elevated expression of the activation markers CD16, CCR2, and HLA-DR and induced greater production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1? compared to healthy controls. Higher serum TNF and BMI were correlated with increased monocyte expression of CCR2. Additionally monocyte CCR2 expression and serum TNF were correlated with worse pain on a validated questionnaire. Conclusions: Our findings suggest monocytes are activated prior to their entry into the synovium. Modulating systemic inflammation and monocyte recruitment to the synovium could be of therapeutic benefit. © 2017 Osteoarthritis Research Society International",BMI; Inflammation; Knee OA; Monocytes; Pain,C reactive protein; CD16 antigen; chemokine receptor CCR2; HLA DR antigen; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor; adult; Article; body mass; cell activation; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; flow cytometry; human; human cell; inflammation; knee osteoarthritis; knee pain; leukocyte count; monocyte; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression; randomized controlled trial (topic); women's health,,W.B.

The knee adduction (KAM) and flexion (KFM) moments, quadriceps strength and power, load frequency, and body mass index (BMI) all have the potential to affect knee articular cartilage integrity by modulating forces across the joint. To identify clinically meaningful change, however, these measurements must be reliable and sensitive to change. This study estimated relative and absolute testretest reliabilities over long periods of biomechanical risk factors for knee osteoarthritis progression. Method: Data from a longitudinal, observational study were analyzed for knee osteoarthritis patients with data at baseline, 6-month and 24-month follow-ups. Gait kinematics and kinetics, quadriceps strength and power, daily load frequency and BMI were collected. Relative and absolute testretest reliabilities of these measures were estimated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard errors of measurement (SEMs), respectively. Minimal detectable change at the 95% confidence level (MDC95) was also calculated. Results: Data from 46 participants [36 women; age 61.0 (6.6) years] were included. Good-to-excellent relative reliabilities (ICC ? 0.80) indicated that KAM peak and impulse, quadriceps strength and power, and BMI had a strong ability to discriminate amongst participants. Absolute reliabilities were high for quadriceps strength and BMI, which demonstrated reasonable within-participant variability (SEMs ? 11% of the mean). The MDC95 values supported use of clinical interventions effective in reducing BMI and KAM, and increasing quadriceps strength. Conclusion: These data are useful in interpreting findings from interventional or longitudinal investigations by determining whether observed changes are beyond measurement error and interpretable as true change. © 2017 Osteoarthritis Research Society International",Arthritis; Biomechanical phenomena; Muscle strength; Obesity; Physical fitness; Skeletal muscle,adduction; adult; age; aged; Article; biomechanics; body mass; cohort analysis; correlation coefficient; disease exacerbation; female; follow up; gait; gender; human; knee adduction; knee function; knee osteoarthritis; longitudinal study; male; measurement error; muscle strength; observational study; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; risk factor; test retest reliability,,W.B.

This study evaluated the tutorial using assessment tools, such as rating scales and test of knowledge about EGMs and random chance. The study results are based on a number of samples, including problem gambling counselors (n = 25) and problem gamblers (n = 26). The interactive tutorial was positively rated by both clients and counselors. In addition, we found a significant improvement in scores on a content test about EGM games for both clients and counselors. An analysis of the specific items suggests that the effects of the tutorial were mainly on those items that were most directly related to the content of the tutorial and did not always generalize to other items. This tutorial is available for use with clients and for education counselors. The data also suggest that the tutorial is equally effective in group settings and in individual settings. These results are promising and illustrate that the tool can be used to teach counselors and clients about game design.

The multi-element total concentration data presented comprise X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses of 6862 rural soil samples collected at 20-cm depth on a non-aligned grid at one site per 2km2. Censored data were imputed using published detection limits. Each soil sample site was assigned to the regional geology map, resulting in spatial data for one categorical variable and 35 continuous variables comprised of individual and amalgamated elements. This paper examines the extent to which soil geochemistry reflects the underlying geology or superficial deposits. Since the soil geochemistry is compositional, log-ratios were computed to adequately evaluate the data using multivariate statistical methods. Principal component analysis (PCA) and minimum/maximum autocorrelation factors (MAF) were used to carry out linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a means to discover and validate processes related to the geologic assemblages coded as age bracket. Peat cover was introduced as an additional category to measure the ability to predict and monitor fragile ecosystems. Overall prediction accuracies for the age bracket categories were 68.4 % using PCA and 74.7 % using MAF. With inclusion of peat, the accuracy for LDA classification decreased to 65.0 and 69.9 %, respectively. The increase in misclassification due to the presence of peat may reflect degradation of peat-covered areas since the creation of superficial deposit classification. © 2017, The Author(s).",Centred log-ratio (clr); Compositional data analysis; Geochemistry; Linear discriminant analysis (LDA); Log-ratios; Minimum/maximum autocorrelation factors (MAF),Analytical geochemistry; Autocorrelation; Deposits; Discriminant analysis; Factor analysis; Geochemical surveys; Geochemistry; Geology; Multivariant analysis; Peat; Soil surveys; Soils; Centred log-ratio (clr); Compositional data analysis; Linear discriminant analyses (LDA); Log-ratios; Minimum/maximum autocorrelation factors; Principal component analysis; autocorrelation; discriminant analysis; environmental monitoring; geochemistry; multivariate analysis; prediction; principal component analysis; soil chemistry; X-ray fluorescence,,Springer Verlag,18748961,,,,English,Math.

The estimates made here using various tools and data including routine core analysis and image logs are confirmatory to estimates made by the World Stress Map and geotectonic facts. NE-SW and NW-SE found to be the dominant orientations for maximum and minimum horizontal stresses in the study area. In addition, three dominant orientations were identified for vertical and sub-vertical fractures atop the crestal region of the anticlinal structure. Image logs found useful in recognition and delineation of natural fractures. The results implemented in a real field development and proved practical in optimal well placement, drilling and production practices. Such integrated studies can be instrumental in any E&amp;P projects and related projects such as geological CO2 sequestration site characterization. © 2018 by the authors.

Results show that deposition of GONPs increase with decreasing IS. However, the Derjaguin LandauVerweyOverbeek (DLVO) interaction energy calculations using a surface element integration technique show that the energy barrier increases with increasing IS for the sheet-shaped colloids interacting with a planar sand surface. In contrast, the presence of nanoscale protruding asperities (NPAs) can cause a decrease in the energy barrier with increasing IS, which facilitates the attachment in primary minima at higher IS. At a given IS, increasing flow velocity increases attachment efficiency on the rough sand surfaces. Torque analysis shows that the maximum hydrodynamic torques are smaller than the adhesive torques, even for GONPs located on the NPAs where the adhesions are the lowest. Consequently, the attachment efficiency cannot be reduced by increasing flow velocity. Additional column experiments confirm that deposited GONPs cannot be detached by increasing flow velocity. Conversely, increase of flow velocity may enhance approaching of GONPs in low-flow regions such as concave areas of sand surfaces and subsequent attachment. Although it has been recognized in the literature that the presence of NPAs can cause decrease of attachment efficiency with increasing flow velocity for spherical colloids under both unfavorable and favorable chemical conditions, our results highlight a different role of surface roughness in attachment and detachment of sheet-shaped colloids under unfavorable conditions. © Soil Science Society of America.",,Colloids; Energy barriers; Graphene oxide; Ionic strength; Nanoparticles; Porous materials; Sand; Surface roughness; Velocity; Attachment and detachments; Attachment efficiency; Chemical conditions; Hydrodynamic torques; Interaction energies; Oxide nanoparticles; Saturated porous media; Surface element integration; Flow velocity; chemical compound; colloid; detection method; efficiency measurement; flow velocity; hydrodynamics; nanoparticle; porous medium; surface roughness,,Soil Science Society of America,15391663,,,,English,Vadose Zone J.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047666933,

This paper proposes a novel simultaneous and proportional multiple degree of freedom (DOF) myoelectric control method for active prostheses. Approach. The approach is based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) of surface EMG signals with the inclusion of sparseness constraints. By applying a sparseness constraint to the control signal matrix, it is possible to extract the basis information from arbitrary movements (quasi-unsupervised approach) for multiple DOFs concurrently. Main Results. In online testing based on target hitting, able-bodied subjects reached a greater throughput (TP) when using sparse NMF (SNMF) than with classic NMF or with linear regression (LR). Accordingly, the completion time (CT) was shorter for SNMF than NMF or LR. The same observations were made in two patients with unilateral limb deficiencies. Significance. The addition of sparseness constraints to NMF allows for a quasi-unsupervised approach to myoelectric control with superior results with respect to previous methods for the simultaneous and proportional control of multi-DOF. The proposed factorization algorithm allows robust simultaneous and proportional control, is superior to previous supervised algorithms, and, because of minimal supervision, paves the way to online adaptation in myoelectric control. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.",muscle synergy; myoelectric signal processing; prosthetic control; sparseness constraint non-negative matrix factorization,Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Factorization; Muscle; Myoelectrically controlled prosthetics; Prosthetics; Signal processing; Factorization algorithms; Multiple-degree-of-freedom; Muscle synergies; Myoelectric signals; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Prosthetic controls; Sparse non-negative matrix factorizations; Unsupervised approaches; Matrix algebra; adult; arm circumference; Article; clinical article; electromyogram; extraction; factorial design; female; human; limb defect; male; measurement accuracy; myoelectric control; online monitoring; priority journal; pronation; signal noise ratio; signal processing; sparse non negative matrix factorization; supination; surface property,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17412560,,,,English,J.

Although we are far from a complete analytic understanding, quantum chaos is often seen as a strong indication that the ansatz holds true. In this paper, we address the thermalization of energy eigenstates in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, a maximally chaotic model of strongly-interacting Majorana fermions. We numerically investigate eigenstate thermalization for specific few-body operators in the original SYK model as well as its N = 1 supersymmetric extension and find evidence that these models satisfy ETH.

Therefore, a detailed mathematical model is desirable for selection of optimal configuration and operating mode among the various options available. In this study, we present a simulation-optimization framework for the optimal selection of economic and environmentally sustainable pathways for natural gas downstream utilization networks by optimizing process design and operational decisions. The main processes (e.g., LNG, GTL, and methanol production), along with different design alternatives in terms of flow-sheeting for each main processing unit (namely syngas preparation, liquefaction, N 2 rejection, hydrogen, FT synthesis, methanol synthesis, FT upgrade, and methanol upgrade units), are used for superstructure development. These processes are simulated using ASPEN Plus V7.3 to determine the yields of different processing units under various operating modes. The model has been applied to maximize total profit of the natural gas utilization system with penalties for environmental impact, represented by CO 2eq emission obtained using ASPEN Plus for each flowsheet configuration and operating mode options. The performance of the proposed modeling framework is demonstrated using a case study. © 2018 by the authors.",CO 2 emissions; Natural gas utilization; Process simulation; Production system design; Sustainable modeling and optimization,Computer software; Energy resources; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Image coding; Methanol; Natural gas; Petroleum deposits; Product design; Synthesis gas manufacture; CO2 emissions; Modeling and optimization; Natural gas utilization; Process simulations; Production system designs; Natural gas deposits,,MDPI AG,19961073,,,,English,Energies,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042365957,

The recent CheckMate 141 clinical trial demonstrated that nivolumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 monoclonal antibody, was efficacious in extending the median overall survival (OS) in this patient population compared with standard therapies. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine whether nivolumab is a cost-effective treatment in this patient population and examined various subgroups to determine for which, if any, the treatment is more cost-effective. Materials and Methods: We implemented a state transition model for HNSCC with a patient cohort who had tumor progression 6 months after the last dose of platinum-containing chemotherapy and compared the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab with docetaxel. Treatment effect estimates and adverse event rates were obtained from CheckMate 141. Costs, utilities, and other model inputs were gathered from published sources. We used a Canadian perspective, a 5-year time horizon, and a 1.5% discount rate for the analysis. Results: Nivolumab extended mean OS by 4 months compared with docetaxel and resulted in fewer treatment-related adverse events, producing an incremental effectiveness of 0.13 quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The incremental cost of treatment with nivolumab was $18,823. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, nivolumab was not a cost-effective treatment option for r/m HNSCC, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $144,744/QALY. Nivolumab would be cost-effective if its price was reduced by 20%. Our subgroup analysis seemed to indicate that nivolumab might be cost-effective for tumors with expression of programmed death-ligand 1 >5%. Conclusion: We conclude that although nivolumab offers clinical benefit for the treatment of r/m HNSCC over current regimens, it is not cost-effective based on its list price. We have also established a value-based price estimate for nivolumab to be cost-effective in this patient population. Further study is required to draw a definitive conclusion on biomarkers for cost-effectiveness. Implications for Practice: In health care settings in which cost considerations are a constraint on choice of therapy, patient selection should be carefully considered to maintain efficiency in the system. Until a biomarker for response to therapy is identified for nivolumab, this medication is unlikely to be cost-effective for most patients with recurrent, metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. © AlphaMed Press 2017","Carcinoma, metastatic; Carcinoma, squamous cell; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Docetaxel; Drug therapy; Nivolumab; Programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 protein",cetuximab; docetaxel; nivolumab; programmed death 1 receptor; acute kidney failure; Article; body mass; cost effectiveness analysis; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; health care cost; Hepatitis B virus; human; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; sensitivity analysis; tumor growth,,Wiley-Blackwell,10837159,,OCOLF,29021380,English,Oncologist,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042095454,

Therefore, we conducted a cohort study to determine the association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and common osteoporotic fragility fractures (upper extremity, hip, spine). Methods The UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink was used to identify adults without prior fractures receiving a new anti-diabetic drug or a new type-2 diabetes diagnosis between 2007 and 2016. The primary aim was to compare new-users of DPP-4 inhibitors versus new-users of sulfonylureas (SU). The association between DPP-4 inhibitors and incident fractures was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Deciles of high-dimensional propensity scores and other anti-diabetic drugs were used as covariates. Results We identified 7993 and 26,636 new-users of DPP-4 inhibitors and SUs, respectively. At cohort entry, the mean age was 58.8, 40% were female, mean diabetes duration was 1.3 years, and 42% had A1c > 9%. Over 9 years (mean follow-up = 1.2 years), the incident rate of fragility fractures was lower among DPP-4 versus SU users (3.0/1000 vs. 5.2/1000 person-years; P-value = 0.007). After adjustment, there was no statistically significant difference in fracture risk (hazard ratio adjusted, aHR = 0.80, 95%CI 0.511.24; P-value = 0.3125). In a secondary analysis, DPP-4 inhibitors were not associated with a difference in fracture risk compared to insulin (aHR = 0.91, 95%CI 0.402.09); however were associated with a lower fracture risk versus thiazolidinediones (aHR = 0.47, 95%CI 0.260.83). Sensitivity analyses supported findings. Conclusions DPP-4 inhibitors are not associated with an increased risk of fragility fractures compared with SUs or insulin; however, are associated with a lower risk versus thiazolidinediones. © 2017 The Authors",Cohort study; Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors; Fracture; Type 2 diabetes,"antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glitazone derivative; insulin; sulfonylurea; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; adult; arm fracture; Article; clinical practice; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; disease association; disease duration; female; follow up; fragility fracture; hip fracture; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; risk factor; secondary analysis; sensitivity analysis; spine fracture; United Kingdom; chemically induced; fracture; risk; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Female; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk",,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,1688227,,DRCPE,29258886,English,Diabetes Res.

A thorough comparison among the recovery techniques is needed to understand their effectiveness and applicability. This study improves on previous studies in two ways. First, we study the impact of leveraging accurate symbol dependencies on the accuracy of architecture recovery techniques. In addition, we evaluate other factors of the input dependencies such as the level of granularity and the dynamic-bindings graph construction. Second, we recovered the architecture of a large system, Chromium, that was not available previously. Obtaining the ground-truth architecture of Chromium involved two years of collaboration with its developers. As part of this work, we developed a new submodule-based technique to recover preliminary versions of ground-truth architectures. The results of our evaluation of nine architecture recovery techniques and their variants suggest that (1) using accurate symbol dependencies has a major influence on recovery quality, and (2) more accurate recovery techniques are needed. Our results show that some of the studied architecture recovery techniques scale to very large systems, whereas others do not. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",empirical software engineering; maintenance and evolution; program comprehension; Software architecture,Chromium; Computer software; Computer software maintenance; Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic programming; Metal recovery; Quality control; Recovery; Software architecture; Software engineering; Architecture recovery; Empirical Software Engineering; Manuals; Program comprehension; Recovery techniques; Software algorithms; Software architecture recovery; Software implementation; Computer architecture,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,985589,,IESED,,English,IEEE Trans Software Eng,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032433166,

The tantalum market has experienced several disruptions and subsequent price swings in the past, implying problems with its supply chain resilience and stability. In this study, we trace the entire value chain of the tantalum industry from mining to the intermediate and the downstream industries. Our interest is to see how dependent the tantalum supply chain is on specific countries and regions, how exposed primary production is to disruptions, and what mechanism counteracts disruption. This study assesses the tantalum supply chain from a resilience perspective rather than an investigation of any specific disruption in the system. We analyze several resilience-promoting mechanisms such as: (a) diversity of supply, (b) material substitution, (c) recycling and (d) stockpiling. We evaluate each of these mechanisms, and find that even though diversity of supply and stockpiling mechanisms have been decreasing for years, the tantalum supply chain has been flexible in its response to disruption. We find a much larger supply from unaccounted artisanal and small mining sources than expected based on official statistics, and estimate the unaccounted production in Africa, which shows an almost 250 percent increase from around 600 tons in 2004 to more than 2000 tons in 2014. Besides flexible primary production from small-scale mining, we identfy rapid material substitution and increasing availability of waste and scrap as the main reasons behind the observed supply chain resilience. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Material flow; Resilience framework; Sustainable supply chain; Tantalum,Scrap metal reprocessing; Supply chains; Material Flow; Material substitutions; Official Statistics; Primary production; Resilience framework; Small-scale mining; Supply chain resiliences; Sustainable supply chains; Tantalum; tantalum; material flow analysis; mining; supply chain management; sustainability; tantalum; waste management; Africa; Article; controlled study; ecosystem resilience; geographic distribution; metal industry; mining; natural resource; recycling,,Elsevier B.V.,9213449,,RCREE,,English,Resour.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of TS use between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2013, was conducted using population-based health administrative databases in Saskatchewan. The prescription drug database was used to describe the annual number of TS dispensations, the number of strips dispensed, the number of unique beneficiaries and the total costs. A patient-level analysis was also carried out to describe the patterns of TS use (i.e. light, moderate or heavy) by the entire cohort and by diabetes treatments. Potential cost savings due to a newly implemented restriction policy were estimated based on the most recent data (2013). Results: TS utilization increased dramatically between 1996 and 2013 in terms of the number of users and the average number of TSs received. The percentage of TS users receiving fewer than 4 TSs per week (i.e. light users) decreased by 20%, while the percentage of heavy users (i.e. those receiving more than 8 TSs per week) increased by 19%. During the same period, the use of high-risk oral hypoglycemic medications declined by 30% among all TS users. Heavy TS use was observed in at least one-third of all users, irrespective of treatment type. Conclusions: If Saskatchewan's newly imposed coverage limits had been applied in 2013, the costs of strips exceeding those limits would have totalled $2.5 million. Although TS use aligns with chronic disease care paradigms, the substantial costs and lack of evidence of patient outcomes demand better strategies to help reduce unnecessary use. © 2017 Diabetes Canada",blood glucose test strips; diabetes; drug utilization; self-monitoring blood glucose test strips,antidiabetic agent; adolescent; adult; analysis; blood; blood glucose monitoring; cost control; diabetes mellitus; economics; female; glucose blood level; health care policy; human; male; retrospective study; Saskatchewan; trends; utilization; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Blood Glucose; Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring; Cost Savings; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Health Policy; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Male; Retrospective Studies; Saskatchewan; Young Adult,,Elsevier B.V.,14992671,,CJDAA,28499790,English,Can.

Evaluation of Naturally Fractured Carbonate Reservoirs (NFCRs) for thermal heavy oil recovery using field pilot tests and exhaustive numerical and analytical modeling is expensive, complex, and personnel-intensive. Robust statistical models have not yet been proposed to predict cumulative steam to oil ratio (CSOR) and recovery factor (RF) during steamflooding in NFCRs as strong process performance indicators. In this paper, new statistical based techniques were developed using multivariable regression analysis for quick estimation of CSOR and RF in NFCRs subjected to steamflooding. The proposed data based models include vital parameters such as in situ fluid and reservoir properties. The data used are taken from experimental studies and rare field trials of vertical well steamflooding pilots in heavy oil NFCRs reported in the literature. The models show an average error of <6% for the worst cases and contain fewer empirical constants compared with existing correlations developed originally for oil sands. The interactions between the parameters were considered indicating that the initial oil saturation and oil viscosity are the most important predictive factors. The proposed models were successfully predicted CSOR and RF for two heavy oil NFCRs. Results of this study can be used for feasibility assessment of steamflooding in NFCRs. © 2018 MDPI AG.

Molecular gas mass is correlated with star formation rate, Ho line luminosity, and central atmospheric gas density. Molecular gas is detected only when the central cooling time or entropy index of the hot atmosphere falls below 1 Gyr or 35 keV cm2, respectively, at a (resolved) radius of 10 kpc. These correlations indicate that the molecular gas condensed from hot atmospheres surrounding the central galaxies. We explore the origins of thermally unstable cooling by evaluating whether molecular gas becomes prevalent when the minimum of the cooling to free-fall time ratio (tcool tff ) falls below 10. We find that (1) molecular gas-rich systems instead lie between 10 < min(tcool tff ) < 25, where tcool tff = 25 corresponds approximately to cooling time and entropy thresholds of 1 Gyr and 35 keV cm2, respectively; (2) min(tcool tff ) is uncorrelated with molecular gas mass and jet power; and (3) the narrow range 10 < min(tcool tff ) < 25 can be explained by an observational selection effect, although a real physical effect cannot be excluded. These results and the absence of isentropic cores in cluster atmospheres are in tension with models that assume thermal instability ensues from linear density perturbations in hot atmospheres when tcool tff 10. Some of the molecular gas may instead have condensed from atmospheric gas lifted outward by buoyantly rising X-ray bubbles or by dynamically induced uplift (e.g., mergers, sloshing). © 2018.

No guidance specific for procedure and patient factors exists in urology. Objective To inform estimates of absolute risk of symptomatic VTE and bleeding requiring reoperation in urological non-cancer surgery. Evidence acquisition We searched for contemporary observational studies and estimated the risk of symptomatic VTE or bleeding requiring reoperation in the 4 wk after urological surgery. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. Evidence synthesis The 37 eligible studies reported on 11 urological non-cancer procedures. The duration of prophylaxis varied widely both within and between procedures; for example, the median was 12.3 d (interquartile range [IQR] 3.155) for open recipient nephrectomy (kidney transplantation) studies and 1 d (IQR 01.3) for percutaneous nephrolithotomy, open prolapse surgery, and reconstructive pelvic surgery studies. Studies of open recipient nephrectomy reported the highest risks of VTE and bleeding (1.87.4% depending on patient characteristics and 2.4% for bleeding). The risk of VTE was low for 8/11 procedures (0.20.7% for patients with low/medium risk; 0.81.4% for high risk) and the risk of bleeding was low for 6/7 procedures (?0.5%; no bleeding estimates for 4 procedures). The quality of the evidence supporting these estimates was low or very low. Conclusions Although inferences are limited owing to low-quality evidence, our results suggest that extended prophylaxis is warranted for some procedures (eg, kidney transplantation procedures in high-risk patients) but not others (transurethral resection of the prostate and reconstructive female pelvic surgery in low-risk patients). Patient summary The best evidence suggests that the benefits of blood-thinning drugs to prevent clots after surgery outweigh the risks of bleeding in some procedures (such as kidney transplantation procedures in patients at high risk of clots) but not others (such as prostate surgery in patients at low risk of clots). Although inferences are limited owing to low-quality evidence, our results suggest that extended prophylaxis is likely to be warranted for some procedures (eg, kidney transplantation procedures in high-risk patients) but not others (transurethral resection of the prostate and reconstructive female pelvic surgery in low-risk patients). © 2017 European Association of Urology",Baseline risk; Bleeding; Modeling; Reporting; Risk of bias; Thromboprophylaxis; Urology; Venous thromboembolism,bibliographic database; bleeding; cancer surgery; deep vein thrombosis; follow up; graft recipient; human; kidney transplantation; low risk patient; meta analysis; nephrectomy; outcome assessment; pelvis surgery; percutaneous nephrolithotomy; postoperative complication; postoperative period; priority journal; prospective study; prostate surgery; reoperation; Review; risk factor; surgical patient; systematic review; transurethral resection; treatment duration; urologic surgery; venous thromboembolism; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; risk assessment; urinary tract disease; venous thromboembolism; Humans; Postoperative Complications; Postoperative Hemorrhage; Risk Assessment; Urologic Diseases; Urologic Surgical Procedures; Venous Thromboembolism,,Elsevier B.V.,3022838,,EUURA,28284738,English,Eur.

""TOP-SCOPE"" is a joint survey program targeting ?2000 PGCCs in J = 1-0 transitions of CO isotopologues and ?1000 PGCCs in 850 ?m continuum emission. The objective of the ""TOP-SCOPE"" survey and the joint surveys (SMT 10 m, KVN 21 m, and NRO 45 m) is to statistically study the initial conditions occurring during star formation and the evolution of molecular clouds, across a wide range of environments. The observations, data analysis, and example science cases for these surveys are introduced with an exemplar source, PGCC G26.53+0.17 (G26), which is a filamentary infrared dark cloud (IRDC). The total mass, length, and mean line mass (M/L) of the G26 filament are ?6200 M, ?12 pc, and ?500 Mpc -1 , respectively. Ten massive clumps, including eight starless ones, are found along the filament. The most massive clump as a whole may still be in global collapse, while its denser part seems to be undergoing expansion owing to outflow feedback. The fragmentation in the G26 filament from cloud scale to clump scale is in agreement with gravitational fragmentation of an isothermal, nonmagnetized, and turbulent supported cylinder. A bimodal behavior in dust emissivity spectral index (?) distribution is found in G26, suggesting grain growth along the filament. The G26 filament may be formed owing to large-scale compression flows evidenced by the temperature and velocity gradients across its natal cloud. © 2018. The American Astronomical Society.

In this paper, we investigate an ac distribution grid integrated with local area packetized-power networks (LAPPNs). LAPPNs, as the dc sector, enable a store-Then-consume mechanism, whereby the sectoral loads characterized as elastic ones, can be manipulated to reduce the distribution level load fluctuation. A multi-mode energy distribution is proposed for the dc sector, including an advanced energy distribution as the 'storing' phase utilizing conventionally non-peak hours, and an open energy distribution as the 'consumption' phase to further compensate the ac sector load fluctuation on real-Time basis. We develop a cross-Time hierarchical energy distribution scheme to coordinate energy distribution of dc sector and ac sector and exploit the elasticity of dc sector loads on both day-Ahead basis and real-Time basis, jointly resulting in a significant mitigation of distribution load fluctuation. Power distribution optimizations are separately formulated and solved for different procedures of the scheme. Simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme in reducing distribution level load fluctuation and to reveal facts on how much dc elastic loads is needed for fluctuation reduction in a scenario in North America. © 2013 IEEE.",DC packetized-power network; demand side management; load shaping,Aggregates; Demand side management; Economics; Elasticity; Electric load management; Electric network analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Interactive computer systems; Packet networks; Ac distribution grids; Distributed energies; Distribution levels; Energy distributions; Load fluctuations; Load modeling; Power distributions; Power networks; Real time systems,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041381241,

Satellite-derived surface observations are used together with a dry deposition model to estimate the dry deposition flux of the most abundant short-lived nitrogen species, NH 3 and NO 2 , over North America during the 2013 warm season. These fluxes demonstrate that the NH 3 contribution dominates over NO 2 for most regions (comprising ~85% of their sum in Canada and ~65% in the U.S.), with some regional exceptions (e.g. Alberta and northeastern U.S.). Nationwide, ~51 t of N from these species were dry deposited in the U.S., approximately double the ~28 t in Canada over this period.

Supervised algorithms trained on raw samples of microstates can successfully detect conventional phase transitions via learning a bulk feature such as an order parameter. In this paper, we investigate whether neural networks can learn to classify phases based on topological defects. We address this question on the two-dimensional classical XY model which exhibits a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. We find significant feature engineering of the raw spin states is required to convincingly claim that features of the vortex configurations are responsible for learning the transition temperature. We further show a single-layer network does not correctly classify the phases of the XY model, while a convolutional network easily performs classification by learning the global magnetization. Finally, we design a deep network capable of learning vortices without feature engineering. We demonstrate the detection of vortices does not necessarily result in the best classification accuracy, especially for lattices of less than approximately 1000 spins. For larger systems, it remains a difficult task to learn vortices. © 2018 American Physical Society.",,,,American Physical Society,24699950,,,,English,Phys. Rev.

A cure or disease modifying pharmaceutical treatment for dementia remains elusive so alternative therapies are of critical importance. Mounting evidence supports exercise in the prevention and therapy of dementia. However, the cognitive, physical, and psychological challenges common to dementia along with a poor understanding and accommodation of dementia in the community are major barriers to exercise. Consequently, effective delivery options need to be identified. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of center-based (CB) exercise versus home-based (HB) exercise for achievement of physical activity guidelines among people with MCI or mild dementia. Methods: This is a randomized parallel-group trial comparing the effects of CB and HB exercise adherence among community-dwelling adults ?50 years with a clinical diagnosis of MCI or mild dementia. Participants will be randomized to either CB or HB exercise. The CB group will meet weekly for small group exercise and will be prescribed additional exercise to be completed independently. Participants in the HB group will be given a physical activity prescription to be completed independently in the community. Participants in HB will also be contacted by phone monthly to adjust exercise prescriptions. The primary outcome will be achievement of exercise guidelines (150 min/wk. of moderate activity) assessed using an activity monitor. Secondary objectives will evaluate cost-effectiveness and the influence of individual and environmental factors on the primary outcome. Tertiary outcomes include physical function, cognition, mood, and quality of life. Discussion: There is scant research to indicate the most effective way to deliver exercise to people with MCI and mild dementia, which is needed specifically because these groups face significant barriers to exercise. To capitalize on the benefits of exercise, feasible exercise delivery options need to be identified. The results of this study will directly complement ongoing clinical trials and will be essential to implementing exercise recommendations specific to the prevention and therapy of dementia in a feasible and cost-effective manner when they emerge.

However, a lack of a standardized measurement to assess physical dining environments has resulted in inconsistent research with potentially invalid and unreliable conclusions. The development of a standardized, construct valid instrument that assesses dining rooms is imperative to systematically examine physical environments in LTC. The purpose of this study was to determine the construct validity of the new Dining Environment Audit Protocol (DEAP) tool. Methods: Secondary data collected from the Making Most of Mealtimes (M3) study was used for this analysis. Data were collected in 32 long term care homes, which included 82 dining rooms and 639 residents. A variety of resident and dining room level constructs were compared to the summative scales found on the DEAP using Spearman correlations and Student t-tests. A regression analysis identified individual characteristics assessed with DEAP that were associated with the summative scales of homelikeness and functionality. Results: Regression analysis (p < 0.05) identified that the DEAP homelikeness scale was positively associated with a view of the garden/green space, presence of a clock and a posted menu. The functionality scale was positively associated with number of chairs and lighting, while negatively associated with furniture with rounded edges and clutter. Additionally, the functionality scale was positively associated (p < 0.05) with the Mealtime Scan physical scale (? = 0.52), the dining room Mealtime-Relational Care Checklist (M-RCC) (? = 0.25), the DEAP total score (? = 0.56), and the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (? = 0.26). Homelikeness was positively associated (p < 0.05) with the DEAP total score (? = 0.53), staff Person Directed Care score (? = 0.49) and the resident Cognitive Performance Scale (t = 2.56), while negatively associated with energy (? =-0.26) and protein intake (? =-0.24). The homelikeness and functionality scales were also associated with one another (? = 0.26). Conclusion: The construct validity of the DEAP was supported through significant correlations with a variety of measures that are theoretically related to the homelikeness and functionality of LTC dining rooms. This secondary analysis supports the use of the DEAP in future research to quantify the physical environment of LTC dining rooms.

The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Aura satellite has been measuring HCN mixing ratios since launch in 2004; the measurements are ongoing at the time of writing. The winter of 2015-2016 saw the largest El Niño event since 1997-1998. We present MLS measurements of HCN in the lower stratosphere for the Aura mission to date, comparing the 2015-2016 El Niño period to the rest of the mission. HCN in 2015-2016 is higher than at any other time during the mission, but ground-based measurements suggest that it may have been even more elevated in 1997-1998. As the MLS HCN data are essentially unvalidated, we show them alongside data from the MIPAS and ACE-FTS instruments; the three instruments agree reasonably well in the tropical lower stratosphere. Global HCN emissions calculated from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED v4.1) database are much greater during large El Niño events and are greater in 1997-1998 than in 2015-2016, thereby showing good qualitative agreement with the measurements. Correlation between El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices, measured HCN, and GFED HCN emissions is less clear if the 2015-2016 event is excluded. In particular, the 2009-2010 winter had fairly strong El Niño conditions and fairly large GFED HCN emissions, but very little effect is observed in the MLS HCN. © Author(s) 2018.

A knowledge gap exists on culturally appropriate and effective prevention and cessation efforts for members of this diverse community, as limited interventions have been developed with and for this population, and there are very few studies determining the impact of these interventions. This study identifies the most salient elements of LGBTQ+ cessation and prevention interventions from the perspective of LGBTQ+ YYA. Methods: Three descriptions of interventions tailored for LGBTQ+ YYA (group cessation counselling, social marketing, and a mobile phone app with social media incorporated), were shared with LGBTQ+ YYA via 24 focus groups with 204 participants in Toronto and Ottawa, Canada. Open-ended questions focused on their feelings, likes and dislikes, and concerns about the culturally modified intervention descriptions. Framework analysis was used to identify overarching themes across all three intervention descriptions. Results: The data revealed eight overarching themes across all three intervention descriptions. Smoking cessation and prevention interventions should have the following key attributes: 1) be LGBTQ+ - specific; 2) be accessible in terms of location, time, availability, and cost; 3) be inclusive, relatable, and highlight diversity; 4) incorporate LGBTQ+ peer support and counselling services; 5) integrate other activities beyond smoking; 6) be positive, motivational, uplifting, and empowering; 7) provide concrete coping mechanisms; and 8) integrate rewards and incentives.

In contrast to bulk crystals, which undergo a phase transition from monoclinic to the inversion symmetry breaking, orthorhombic phase below ?250K, we find that in moderately thin samples below ?12nm, a single orthorhombic phase exists up to and beyond room temperature. This could be due to the effect of c-axis confinement, which lowers the energy of an out-of-plane hole band and stabilizes the orthorhombic structure. Our results suggest that Weyl nodes, predicated upon inversion symmetry breaking, may be observed in thin MoTe2 at room temperature. © 2018 American Physical Society.",,,,American Physical Society,24699950,,,,English,Phys.

Of these domains, semantics is somewhat unique in that there is little clarity concerning what a model needs to be able to do in order to provide an account of how the meanings of complex linguistic expressions, such as sentences, are understood. We argue that one thing such models need to be able to do is generate predictions about which further sentences are likely to follow from a given sentence; these define the sentence's ""inferential role."" We then show that it is possible to train a tree-structured neural network model to generate very simple examples of such inferential roles using the recently released Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset. On an empirical front, we evaluate the performance of this model by reporting entailment prediction accuracies on a set of test sentences not present in the training data. We also report the results of a simple study that compares human plausibility ratings for both human-generated and model-generated entailments for a random selection of sentences in this test set. On a more theoretical front, we argue in favor of a revision to some common assumptions about semantics: understanding a linguistic expression is not only a matter of mapping it onto a representation that somehow constitutes its meaning; rather, understanding a linguistic expression is mainly a matter of being able to draw certain inferences. Inference should accordingly be at the core of any model of semantic cognition. © 2018 Blouw and Eliasmith.",Language comprehension; Natural language inference; Recursive neural networks; Semantics,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,16641078,,,,English,Front.

A key finding is that for wave packets whose constituent waves are short in comparison to the solitary wave width, the interaction leads to an almost complete destruction of the short waves. For mode-1 short waves in the packet, as the wavelength increases, a cutoff is reached, and for larger wavelengths the waves in the packet are able to maintain their structure after the interaction. This cutoff corresponds to the wavelength at which the phase speed of the short waves upstream of the solitary wave exceeds the maximum current induced by the solitary wave. For mode-2 waves in the packet, however, no corresponding cutoff is found. Analysis based on linear theory suggests that the destruction of short waves occurs primarily due to the velocity shear induced by the solitary wave, which alters the vertical structure of the waves so that significant wave activity is found only above (below) the deformed pycnocline for overtaking (head-on) collisions. The deformation of vertical structure is more significant for waves with a smaller wavelength. Consequently, it is more difficult for these waves to adjust to the new solitary-wave-induced background environment. These results suggest that through the interaction with relatively smaller length scale waves, internal solitary waves can provide a means to decrease the power observed in the short-wave band in the coastal ocean. © Author(s) 2018.",,coastal zone; comparative study; computer simulation; internal wave; solitary wave; theoretical study; wave velocity; wavelength,,Copernicus GmbH,10235809,,,,English,Nonlinear Processes Geophys.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040716650,

Methods: The prospective, nonsignificant risk, open-label, randomized, multi-center clinical trial included 55 soft contact lens (SCL) wearers with MGD and evaporative dry eye. Subjects were randomized to the single VTP treatment group or an untreated control. The controls received a crossover VTP treatment at 3 months (crossover treatment group). Primary effectiveness measures were meibomian gland secretion (MGS) score and Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) that were evaluated at baseline, at 1 and 3 months post-VTP treatment, and at 1 month post-VTP treatment in the crossover treatment group. Exploratory variables included fluorescein tear break-up time (TBUT), lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE), lid parallel conjunctival folds (LIPCOF), ocular surface staining, frequency of over-the-counter (OTC) drop use, and hours of comfortable contact lens wear. Results: At 3 months, the treatment group showed significantly greater mean change from baseline in MGS (12.4±9.1 vs 1.4±6.4, p?0.0001), SPEED (?8.4±4.7 vs ?0.7±4.4, p?0.0001) and significantly greater improvement in exploratory variables (TBUT, LWE, and frequency of OTC drop use) relative to the controls. Mean comfortable contact lens wearing time increased by 4.0±3.9 hours at 1 month. This was sustained for 3 months with no change in the control group. The crossover treatment group demonstrated similar results to the treatment group at 1 month post-VTP. Conclusion: In SCL wearers with MGD, a single VTP treatment significantly improved mean meibomian gland function and significantly reduced dry eye signs and symptoms compared to an untreated control. The treatment increased mean comfortable lens wearing time by 4 hours (approximately doubling the pretreatment findings). This was sustained for up to 3 months post-treatment on average. © 2018 Blackie et al.",Comfortable contact lens wearing time; Dynamic Meibomian Imaging; Evaporative dry eye; Meibomian gland dysfunction; Soft contact lens wear; Vectored thermal pulsation,adult; Article; Canada; clinical effectiveness; conservative treatment; controlled study; dry eye; eye disease assessment; female; fluorescein tear break up time; frequency of over the counter; human; lid parallel conjunctival fold; lid wiper epitheliopathy; major clinical study; male; meibomian gland dysfunction; meibomian gland secretion score; multicenter study; ocular surface staining; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; single vectored thermal pulsation; Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness; United States; visual system parameters,,Dove Medical Press Ltd,11775467,,,,English,Clin.

However, subcanopy soil-surface temperatures have been, to date, characterized through isolated, spatially discrete measurements. Using spatially complex forested northern peatlands as an exemplar ecosystem, we explore the high-resolution spatiotemporal thermal behavior of this critical interface and its response to disturbances by using Fiber-Optic Distributed Temperature Sensing. Soil-surface thermal patterning was identified from 1.9 million temperature measurements under undisturbed, trees removed and vascular subcanopy removed conditions. Removing layers of the structurally diverse vegetation canopy not only increased mean temperatures but it shifted the spatial and temporal distribution, range, and longevity of thermal hot spots and hot moments. We argue that linking hot spots and/or hot moments with spatially variable ecosystem processes and feedbacks is key for predicting ecosystem function and resilience. ©2017.

It is the basis of several interactive multiuser applications, such as distance learning and multimedia multiplayer online games. The cloud-based provisioning of the conferencing services on which these applications rely on can have several benefits, including the easy provisioning of new applications, efficient use of resources, and elastic scalability. This paper proposes a holistic cloud-based architecture for conferencing service provisioning, which covers both the infrastructure and platform layers of the cloud. The proposed infrastructure layer offers conferencing substrates-as-a-service (e.g., dial-in signaling, video mixing, and audio mixing), instead of virtual machines or containers. The platform layer abstracts the details of the conferencing concepts and offers a high-level interface to simplify conference service provisioning for a wide range of service and application providers (experts versus non-experts). It also enables the on-the-fly scaling of the running conferences while guaranteeing the required quality of service, enables substrates composition to create new conferencing services, and eases the reuse of conferencing services in building new applications. The presented architecture is supported by a proof-of-concept prototype and performance measurements. The latter provides the analysis of resource allocation efficiency and response time, as well as the scalability of the system under suboptimal and over-provisioned conditions. It also provides recommendations for service providers regarding the best alternatives for provisioning their service. © 2013 IEEE.",Cloud computing; conferencing service provisioning; infrastructure-as-a-service; multimedia conferencing; platform-as-a-service; substrate-as-a-service,Cloud computing; Computer games; Distance education; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Mixers (machinery); Mixing; Multimedia systems; Platform as a Service (PaaS); Quality of service; Scalability; Substrates; Video conferencing; Allocation efficiencies; Cloud-based architectures; Games; Multi-media communications; Multi-player online games; Multimedia conferencing; Performance measurements; Service provisioning; Computer architecture,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041663070,

Historical climate and field hydrometeorological data from a moderate-rich fen watershed were used to (a) identify whether the spring 2016 conditions were outside the range of natural variability for WBP climate cycles, (b) explain the observed patterns in burn severity across the watershed, and (c) identify whether fall and winter moisture signals observed in peatlands and lowland forests in the region are indicative of wildfire. Field hydrometeorological data from the fen watershed confirmed the presence of cumulative moisture deficits prior to the fire. Hydrogeological investigations highlighted the susceptibility of fen and upland areas to water table and soil moisture decline over rain-free periods (including winter), due to the watershed's reliance on supply from localized flow systems originating in topographic highs. Subtle changes in topographic position led to large changes in groundwater connectivity, leading to greater organic soil consumption by fire in wetland margins and at high elevations. The 2016 spring moisture conditions measured prior to the ignition of the fen watershed were not illustrated well by the Drought Code (DC) when standard overwintering procedures were applied. However, close agreement was found when default assumptions were replaced with measured duff soil moisture recharge and incorporated into the overwintering DC procedure. We conclude that accumulated moisture deficits dating back to the summer of 2015 led to the dry conditions that preceded the fire. The infrequent coinciding of several hydrometeorological conditions, including low autumn soil moisture, a modest snowpack, lack of spring precipitation, and high spring air temperatures and winds, ultimately led to the Horse river wildfire spreading widely and causing the observed burn patterns. Monitoring soil moisture at different land classes and watersheds would aid management strategies in the production of more accurate overwintered DC calculations, providing fire management agencies early warning signals ahead of severe spring wildfire seasons. © 2017 Author.",,burning; early warning system; fen; fire management; hydrometeorology; seasonal variation; soil moisture; watershed; wildfire; Alberta; Canada; Fort McMurray; Equidae,,Copernicus GmbH,15618633,,,,English,Nat.

A cold-rolled 0.1C5Mn medium Mn steel with a ferrite matrix plus metastable austenite duplex microstructure was resistance spot-welded with various welding currents and times. The nugget size rose with the increase of heat input, but when the welding current exceeded the critical value, the tensile-shear load increased slowly and became unstable due to metal expulsion. The fusion zone exhibited a lath martensite microstructure, and the heat-affected zone was composed of a ferrite/martensite matrix with retained austenite. The volume fraction of retained austenite decreased gradually from the base metal to the fusion zone, while the microhardness presented a reverse varying trend. Interfacial failure occurred along the interface of the steel sheets with lower loading capacity. Sufficient heat input along with serious expulsion brought about high stress concentration around the weld nugget, and the joint failed in partial interfacial mode. Pull-out failure was absent in this study. © 2018 by the authors.

There is, however, concern that rewarding scientists chiefly on publication creates a perverse incentive, allowing careless and fraudulent conduct to thrive, compounded by the predisposition of top-tier journals towards novel, positive findings rather than investigations confirming null hypothesis. This potentially compounds a reproducibility crisis in several fields, and risks undermining science and public trust in scientific findings. To date, there has been comparatively little modelling on factors that influence science trustworthiness, despite the importance of quantifying the problem. We present a simple phenomenological model with cohorts of diligent, careless and unethical scientists, with funding allocated by published outputs. This analysis suggests that trustworthiness of published science in a given field is influenced by false positive rate, and pressures for positive results. We find decreasing available funding has negative consequences for resulting trustworthiness, and examine strategies to combat propagation of irreproducible science. © 2018 The Authors.",Public trust in science; Publish or perish; Research ethics; Research fraud; Science trustworthiness,,,Royal Society Publishing,20545703,,,,English,R.

Tripolyphosphate (TPP) is considered a form of slow release P fertilizer in P limited soils, however, investigations of the chemical fate of TPP in soils are limited. It has been proposed that TPP rapidly hydrolyzes in the soil solution before adsorbing or precipitating with soil surfaces, but in model systems, TPP also adsorbs rapidly onto mineral surfaces. To study the adsorption behavior of TPP in calcareous soils, a short-term (48 h) TPP spike was performed under laboratory conditions. To determine the fate of TPP under field conditions, two different liquid TPP amendments were applied to a P limited subsurface field site via an in-ground injection system. Phosphorus speciation was assessed using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, total and labile extractable P, and X-ray diffraction. Adsorption of TPP to soil mineral surfaces was rapid (< 48 h) and persisted without fully hydrolyzing to ortho-P. Linear combination fitting of XAS data indicated that the distribution of adsorbed P was highest (~30-40%) throughout the site after the first TPP amendment application (high water volume and low TPP concentrations). In contrast, lower water volumes with more concentrated TPP resulted in lower relative fractions of adsorbed P (15-25%), but a significant increase in total P concentrations (~ 3000 mg P kg soil) and adsorbed P (60%) directly adjacent to the injection system. This demonstrates that TPP application increases the adsorbed P fraction of calcareous soils through rapid adsorption reactions with soil mineral surfaces. © 2018 The Author(s).",Calcium phosphate minerals; Phosphorus amendment; Phosphorus XANES; Tripolyphosphate adsorption,adsorption; calcareous soil; calcium; hydrolysis; phosphate; precipitation (chemistry); soil chemistry; XANES spectroscopy,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14674866,,,,English,Geochem.

We clearly observed spatially separated metallic and insulating states during the transition between commensurate and nearly commensurate charge-density-wave phases. The capability to probe electrodynamics on nanometer length scales revealed temperature-dependent electronic properties of the insulating and metallic regions near the transition temperature. At fixed temperature, a remarkably broad spatial boundary between insulating and metallic regions was observed, across which the nano-optical signal smoothly evolved over a length scale of several hundred nanometers. To understand these observations, we performed Ginzburg-Landau calculations to determine the charge-density-wave structure of the domain boundary, which revealed the existence of an intermediate electronic phase with unique properties distinct from the bulk thermodynamic phases. © 2018 American Physical Society.",,,,American Physical Society,24699950,,,,English,Phys.

We know little, however, about whether mixed-use developments affect housing affordability. We question the impact of mixed-use zoning on housing affordability in Toronto (Canada) between 1991 and 2006 in the face of waning government support for affordable housing and increasing income inequality due to the occupational restructuring accompanying a shift to a knowledge-based economy. We fi nd that housing in mixed-use zones remained less affordable than housing in the rest of the city and in the metropolitan region. High-income service occupations experienced improved affordability while lower wage service, trade, and manufacturing occupations experienced stagnant or worsening affordability. Housing in mixed-use zones is increasingly affordable only to workers already able to pay higher housing costs. Our findings are limited to Canada's largest city but have lessons for large North American cities with similar urban economies and housing markets. Takeaway for practice: Mixed-use developments may reduce housing affordability in core areas and inadvertently reinforce the sociospatial inequality resulting from occupational polarization unless supported by appropriate affordable housing policies. Planners should consider a range of policy measures to offset the unintentional outcomes of mixed-use developments and ensure affordability within mixed-use zones: inclusionary zoning, density bonuses linked to affordable housing, affordable housing trusts, and other relevant methods. © 2018 American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.",housing affordability; mixed use; occupational polarization; Toronto; zoning,affordable housing; economic development; equity; income distribution; metropolitan area; occupation; urban economy; zoning system; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto,,Routledge,1944363,,,,English,J.

The proportion of childparent dyads with a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was computed. Children reported higher KIDSCREEN-27 scores for all subscales compared to parents. At baseline and at six months, childparent agreement was generally low to moderate (ICC =.25.67) and the proportion of MCID was high (3679%).

Classical C-C bond forming reactions such as the Stille and Suzuki coupling reactions have been widely used in the past for this purpose. More recently, direct (hetero)arylation polymerization (DHAP) has earned a place in the spotlight with an increasing number of ?-conjugated polymers being produced using this atom-economic and more sustainable chemistry. As semiconductors in organic electronics, the device performances of the polymers made by DHAP are of great interest and importance. This review compares the device performances of some representative ?-conjugated polymers made using the DHAP method with those made using the conventional C-C bond forming reactions when they are used as semiconductors in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). © 2018 by the authors.",Direct arylation; Green chemistry; Organic electronics; Organic photovoltaics; Organic thin film transistors,"polymer; chemical structure; chemistry; comparative study; green chemistry; polymerization; semiconductor; synthesis; transistor; Green Chemistry Technology; Molecular Structure; Polymerization; Polymers; Semiconductors; Transistors, Electronic",,MDPI AG,14203049,,MOLEF,29794982,English,Molecules,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047861185,

Unique properties of CNs coupled with the global quest to develop low carbon footprint alternatives as aids for water treatment processes have been the driving force for the increasing interest among researchers worldwide. There are several reviews that describe the chemistry and modification of CNs; however, a comprehensive review on the potential application of CNs in water/wastewater treatment processes is scarce. Thus, this review provides a detailed overview of pristine, surface-functionalized CNs and CN-incorporated nanocomposites for applications in various water/wastewater treatment processes, such as sorption, membrane filtration, and flocculation. The latest advances and developments on other processes using CNs, such as catalytic degradation and disinfection, are also discussed. The mechanism responsible for the performance of CN-based systems in all these water treatment processes is also elucidated. The key challenges and knowledge gaps that limit the practical application of CNs in water treatment processes are examined, which offer appropriate perspectives to researchers working in this field. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,,Royal Society of Chemistry,20518153,,,,English,Environ.

Here, we demonstrate a new approach to nanoparticle recovery, combining the advantages of flocculation with magnetic separation to enable simple collection of non-magnetic nanoparticles. Flocculant polymers were coated onto magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4@SiO2) to prepare reusable magnetic flocculants (MFs). When added to colloidal nanoparticle dispersions, MFs aggregate with the suspended nanoparticles to form magnetically responsive flocs, which upon separation can be reversibly deflocculated for nanoparticle release, and reused in a closed loop process. High separation efficiency was attained in a variety of nanoparticle suspensions, including Au, Ag, Pd, Pt, and TiO2, stabilized by different coatings and surface charge. The MFs were shown to be recyclable for photocatalytic treatment of naphthenic acids in oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) and selenate in flue gas desulfurization wastewater (FGDW). Magnetic flocculation thus represents a general platform and alternative paradigm for nanoparticle separation, with potential applications in water treatment and remediation of nanoparticle pollution. Furthermore, given that flocculant chemicals can be recovered and reused in this process, magnetic flocculation may also serve as an environmentally sustainable solution to conventional flocculation challenges. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,,Royal Society of Chemistry,20518153,,,,English,Environ.

This work uses a novel multi-functional polymer binder, PEDOT:PSS-Mg 2+ , to address the above issues. First, PEDOT:PSS is a highly conductive polymer, which improves the conductivity of the cathode composite. Second, cross-linking of PEDOT:PSS with Mg 2+ forms a robust network that is able to endure the drastic volume change of the cathode during discharge/charge. Third, the abundant oxygen atoms present in PEDOT:PSS strongly interact with lithium polysulfides to suppress the shuttle effect. Li-S batteries with this new binder showed high initial specific capacity of up to 1097 mA h g -1 and high capacity retention of up to 74% after 250 cycles at 0.5C with a sulfur content of 70 wt% in the cathode, which are significant improvements compared with the corresponding Li-S batteries with a conventional PVDF binder. Additionally, preparation of the cathode material with this new binder uses water as the solvent, avoiding the use of toxic organic solvents such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Binders; Cathodes; Conducting polymers; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Polysulfides; Cath-ode materials; Cycling stability; Discharge-charge; Highly conductive polymers; Low conductivity; N-methylpyrrolidone; Polysulfide shuttles; Specific capacities; Lithium sulfur batteries; comparative study; composite; electrode; fuel cell; ionic composition; lithium; performance assessment; polymer; sulfur,,Royal Society of Chemistry,23984902,,,,English,Sustain.

By using a double mutant based on the Ce13d DNAzyme, and by lowering the temperature, increased 2-aminopurine (2AP) fluorescence was observed with addition of both Na + and K + . The fluorescence increase was similar for these two metals at below 10 mM, after which K + took a different pathway. Since 2AP probes its local base stacking environment, K + can be considered to induce misfolding. Binding of both Na + and K + was specific, since single base mutations could fully inhibit 2AP fluorescence for both metals. The binding thermodynamics was measured by temperature-dependent experiments revealing enthalpy-driven binding for both metals and less coordination sites compared to G-quadruplex DNA. Cleavage activity assays indicated a moderate cleavage activity with 10 mM K + , while further increase of K + inhibited the activity, also supporting its misfolding of the DNAzyme. For comparison, a G-quadruplex DNA was also studied using the same system, where Na + and K + led to the same final state with only around 8-fold difference in K d .

CP algorithms are essential for content delivery for their major role in selecting content to be stored in the geographically distributed surrogate servers in the cloud to meet end-user demands with quality of service (QoS). Evidently, the key objectives of CP, i.e., cost and QoS, are competing. Cost is determined by the underlying cost model of the CCDN infrastructure while the delivered QoS is determined by where the content is placed in the CCDN. Therefore, we provide an overview of the content and the CCDN infrastructure. The overview of the content includes content characteristics and the influence of Online Social Networking on CP. The overview of the CCDN infrastructure includes elasticity and cost model, which affect CP. Our goal is to provide a holistic perspective of the aspects that impact CP algorithms and their efficiency. From the influential factors, we derive a set of design criteria for CP algorithms in CCDNs. We discuss the state-of-the-art CP algorithms for CCDNs and evaluate them against the well-motivated design criteria.

One thing these domains have in common is that they contain dynamics that can be characterized as a spatially spreading process (SSP), which requires many parameters to be set precisely to model the dynamics, spread rates, and directional biases of the elements which are spreading. We present related work in artificial intelligence and machine learning for SSP sustainability domains including forest wildfire prediction. We then introduce a novel approach for learning in SSP domains using reinforcement learning (RL) where fire is the agent at any cell in the landscape and the set of actions the fire can take from a location at any point in time includes spreading north, south, east, or west or not spreading. This approach inverts the usual RL setup since the dynamics of the corresponding Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a known function for immediate wildfire spread. Meanwhile, we learn an agent policy for a predictive model of the dynamics of a complex spatial process. Rewards are provided for correctly classifying which cells are on fire or not compared with satellite and other related data. We examine the behavior of five RL algorithms on this problem: value iteration, policy iteration, Q-learning, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). We compare to a Gaussian process-based supervised learning approach and also discuss the relation of our approach to manually constructed, state-of-the-art methods from forest wildfire modeling. We validate our approach with satellite image data of two massive wildfire events in Northern Alberta, Canada; the Fort McMurray fire of 2016 and the Richardson fire of 2011. The results show that we can learn predictive, agent-based policies as models of spatial dynamics using RL on readily available satellite images that other methods and have many additional advantages in terms of generalizability and interpretability. © 2018 Ganapathi Subramanian and Crowley.",A3C; Deep learning; Forest wildfire management; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Spatially spreading processes; Sustainability,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,2297198X,,,,English,Front.

Research on motion perception in HFA has shown deficits in processing motion information at the higher visual cortical areas (V5/middle temporal). Several hypotheses have been put forth to explain these deficits as being due to enhanced processing of small details at the expense of the global picture or as a global integration abnormality. However, there is a lot of variability in the results obtained from experiments designed to study motion in adults with autism. These could be due to the inherent diagnostic differences within even the same range of the autism spectrum and/or due to comparison of different experimental paradigms whose processing by the same visual neural areas could be different. In this review, we discuss the various results on motion processing in HFA, as well as the theories of motion perception in autism. © 2018 Bakroon and Lakshminarayanan.",Autism-spectrum disorder; Biological motion; Form perception; Global motion; High-functioning autism; Local motion; Motion perception; Random-dot kinematogram,,,Dove Medical Press Ltd.,11792752,,,,English,Clin.

Monitoring extreme snowfall trends in response to climate change is essential for sustainability and adaptation studies because climate change could significantly influence variability in precipitation during the 21st century. Many studies investigating snowfall within the GLB have focused on specific case study events with apparent under examinations of regional extreme snowfall trends. The current research explores the historical extremes in snowfall by assessing the intensity, frequency, and duration of snowfall within Ontario's GLB. Spatiotemporal snowfall and precipitation trends are computed for the 1980 to 2015 period using Daymet (Version 3) monthly gridded interpolated datasets from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Results show that extreme snowfall intensity, frequency, and duration have significantly decreased, at the 90% confidence level, more so for the Canadian leeward shores of Lake Superior than that of Lake Huron, for the months of December and January. To help discern the spatiotemporal trends is snowfall extremes, several trend analyses for lake-induced predictor variables were analysed for two cities, Wawa and Wiarton, along the snowbelts of Lakes Superior and Huron, respectively. These variables include monthly maximum and minimum air temperature, maximum wind gust velocity, lake surface temperature, and maximum annual ice cover concentration. Resultant significant increase in December's maximum and minimum air temperature for the city of Wawa may be a potential reason for the decreased extreme snowfall trends. © 2018 Janine A.

However, there is a paucity of research that examines associations between individual differences in thinking style, participation in scratch card gambling, and problem gambling severity. Methods: In three studies, we sought to examine the relationships among these variables in large, online samples of participants. Participants completed the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), the Actively Open-Minded Thinking Scale, and self-reported their frequency of scratch card gambling. Results: Throughout all three studies, specific associations were reliably established. Specifically, negative associations were observed between participants CRT and PGSI scores, as well as between participants CRT scores and scratch card gambling frequency. In addition, we found a positive association between problem gambling severity and scratch card gambling frequency. Finally, problem gambling severity was shown to correlate positively with participants willingness to pay for irrelevant information in a scratch card gambling scenario. Discussion and conclusions: Overall, we observed that problem gambling severity is associated with an individuals thinking style and scratch card gambling behavior. This study adds to the existing literature examining problem gambling, and highlights the role of thinking style in understanding gambling behavior and problematic gambling. © 2018 The Author(s).",Cognitive Reflection Test; Individual differences; Problem gambling; Scratch card gambling; Thinking style,"adult; article; gambling; human; human tissue; thinking; addiction; female; gambling; individuality; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; severity of illness index; thinking; young adult; Adult; Behavior, Addictive; Female; Gambling; Humans; Individuality; Male; Middle Aged; Severity of Illness Index; Thinking; Young Adult",,Akademiai Kiado Rt.,20625871,,,30567454,English,J.

There are first forces of change, which propel suburbs in new directions. Much of the present literature on suburbs highlights suburban transitions in the form of social and economic diversification, and of new forms of development. The article attempts to rebalance the discourse on suburbs by emphasizing forces of durability. It does not deny the importance of observed suburban transitions, but argues that there is, at the heart of North American suburbs, an enduring automobility-induced transportation dynamic, which reverberates on most aspects of suburbs. The article explores the mechanisms undergirding suburban durability by linking the suburban transportation dynamic to the self-reproductive effects of a suburban lifestyle and culture and their political manifestations. These forces impede planning attempts to transform suburbs in ways that make them more environmentally sustainable. To empirically ground its argument, the article draws on two Toronto region case studies illustrating processes assuring the persistence of the durable features of North American suburbs: the layout of large suburban multifunctional centres and the themes raised by Rob Ford during his successful 2010 mayoralty electoral campaign. © 2018 by the author.",Automobile dependence; Land use; North america; Suburb; Super grid; Toronto; Transportation,,,Cogitatio Press,21837635,,,,English,Urban Planning,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059226107,

Different grading scales are employed by many clinicians and researchers to undertake this procedure for corneal staining comparisons between eyes, products and over time. This paper describes the development and use of a grading scale for corneal staining undertaken at an academic research site. The scale involves assessment of three factors across five corneal zones: type, area and depth. Staining type and area are graded on a 0100 scale, and depth is graded on a 04 scale. These factors can be combined to create a three-or two-factor staining grade, or the factors may be reported individually. An additional benefit of this scale is that the staining scores may be reported by zone as zone staining scores or the scores of zones may be combined to provide an overall corneal global staining score. © 2018 Woods et al.",Corneal staining; Fluorescein staining; Grading scale,Article; cornea permeability; corneal staining; eye disease assessment; eye examination; human; image analysis; medical record; optical depth; practice guideline; sensitivity analysis; staining,,Dove Medical Press Ltd,11775467,,,,English,Clin.

Switching from fossil fuels to more environmentally friendly energy sources and to Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) is a promising option for future transportation but well to wheel emission and charging/refuelling patterns must also be considered. This paper investigates the barriers to and opportunities for electric charging and hydrogen refueling infrastructure incentives in Ontario, Canada and estimates the number of Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) that would be offset by infrastructure incentives. The paper also assesses the potential of electric and hybrid-electric powertrains to enable GHG reductions, explores the impact of the electricity supply mix for supporting zero-emission vehicles in different scenarios and studies the effect of the utility factor for PHEVs in Ontario. The authors compare the use of electric vehicle charging infrastructures and hydrogen refueling stations regarding overall GHG emission reductions for an infrastructure incentive funded by a 20-million-dollar government grant. The results suggest that this incentive can provide infrastructure that can offset around 9000 ICEVs vehicles using electricity charging infrastructure and 4000-8700 when using hydrogen refuelling stations. Having appropriate limitations and policy considerations for the potential 1.7 million electric-based vehicles that may be in use by 2024 in Ontario would result in 5-7 million tonne GHG avoidances in different scenarios, equivalent to the removal of 1-1.5 million ICEVs from the road. © 2018 by the authors.",Electric vehicles; Fuel Cell Vehicles; GHGmitigation; Infrastructure incentive; Transportation,Air pollution; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Hydrogen; Internal combustion engines; Transportation; Vehicles; Electric vehicle charging infrastructures; Fuel cell vehicles; GHGmitigation; Hybrid-electric powertrain; Hydrogen refueling stations; Hydrogen refuelling stations; Infrastructure incentive; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Greenhouse gases,,MDPI AG,20326653,,,,English,World Electr.

Conventional approaches to selecting monitoring indicators are often biased and non-inclusive. A new Criteria-based Ranking (CBR) process for selecting and/or prioritizing indicators was tested in the Muskoka River Watershed (Ontario, Canada). The CBR process is based on two environmental assessment tools, Simple Weighted and Leopold matrices. It incorporates environmental components and criteria for assessing each indicator, which generate a score per indicator. The process tested in this study was concluded to be an effective way to prioritize and/or select environmental monitoring indicators. A different set of indicators emerged when a common set of criteria was used to assess monitoring indicators. Benefits of the CBR process include:  Standardization of indicator selection process with less bias and lower cost (e.g., time and human resources). Indicators that are representative of the community and more relevant for decision-making (e.g., more resilient to socio-political change). Adaptability: (1) to other goals, e.g., selecting from a list of Valued Ecosystem Components (VECs), and (2) to any context through localized scoring criteria.

However, unless the number of tickets remaining to be purchased is also provided, this information is uninformative. Despite its lack of utility in assisting gamblers in choosing the most favourable type of scratch card to play, we hypothesized that unclaimed prize information would bias participants judgments within a scratch card gambling context. In Experiment 1 (N = 201), we showed that participants are influenced by this information such that they felt more likely to win, were more excited to play, and preferred to hypothetically purchase more of the scratch card with the greatest number of unclaimed prizes. In Experiment 2 (N = 201), we attempted to ameliorate this bias by providing participants with the number of tickets remaining to be purchased and equating the payback percentages of all three games. The bias, although attenuated, still persisted in these conditions. Finally, in Experiment 3 (N = 200), we manipulated the hypothetical scratch cards such that games with the highest number of unclaimed prizes were the least favourable, and vice versa. As in Experiment 2, participants still favoured cards with greater numbers of unclaimed prizes. Possible mechanisms underlying this bias are discussed. In conclusion, across three experiments, we demonstrate that salient unclaimed prize information is capable of exerting a strong effect over judgments related to scratch card games. © The Author(s) 2018.",Cognitive biases; Decision making; Gambling; Scratch cards; Unclaimed prize information,"adult; article; cognitive bias; controlled study; female; gambling; human; major clinical study; male; perception; addiction; awards and prizes; decision making; emotion; gambling; psychology; reinforcement; reward; statistical bias; Adult; Awards and Prizes; Behavior, Addictive; Bias; Emotions; Female; Gambling; Humans; Judgment; Male; Reinforcement (Psychology); Reward",,Springer New York LLC,10505350,,JERSE,29594722,English,J.

Individuals who voted for the winning candidate were expected to experience increased engagement, whereas individuals who voted for the losing candidate were expected to experience decreased engagement. We tested these predictions within the context of the 2016 US presidential election. Using a sample of 232 working Americans, work engagement and job performance were assessed one week prior to the election, the day after the election, and one week after the election. Contrary to our prediction, individuals who voted for Trump (the winning candidate) did not report increased work engagement, thereby providing no evidence of positive spillover. However, individuals who voted for Clinton (the losing candidate) were less engaged on the day after the election compared to baseline, demonstrating negative spillover. Downstream, work engagement was positively related to job performance. However, these effects were relatively short-lived, as engagement returned to baseline levels within one week following the election. Our results suggest that elections can have important implications for work-related outcomes. From a practical perspective we suggest that to the extent possible it may be prudent to avoid scheduling important work tasks for the days following presidential elections. © 2018 The Authors Applied Psychology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association of Applied Psychology",,adult; American; article; election; human; job performance; prediction; work engagement,,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,0269994X,,,,English,Appl.

The gradient in health is apparent in objective and subjective measures, across virtually all countries, and is evident at individual and population levels. There is no longer much debate over the relationship between SES and health. However, exact causal pathways remain elusive. Advocating for strong policy to reduce or eliminate the SES-health gradient necessitates understanding the causal pathways, from intervention to outcome. While economists are not convinced that there is a clear enough understanding of the causal pathways of the SES-health gradient, they have produced a substantial body of work from which to move forward. The article briefly discusses the theoretical underpinnings used by economists as a basis for the study of the causal pathways for the health gradient. That presentation is followed by a concise overview of some of the evidence that economists have produced. The paper concludes with a discussion of how current economic evidence may be used to help policymakers advocate for interventions to limit the SES gradient in noncommunicable diseases. © 2018 Pan American Health Organization.

First, scholars have emphasized that the hybrid regimes that emerged in the post-Cold War era should not be treated as diminished sub-types of democracy, and second, regime type is a multi-dimensional concept. This review essay further contends that losing the lexicon of hybridity and focusing on a single dimension of regime typeflawed electoral competitionhas prevented an examination of extra-electoral factors that are necessary for understanding how regimes are differently hybrid, why there is such immense variation in the outcome of elections and why these regimes are constantly in flux. Therefore, a key recommendation emerging from this review of the scholarship is that to achieve a more thorough, multi-dimensional assessment of hybrid regimes, further research ought to be driven by nested research designs in which qualitative and quantitative approaches can be used to advance mid-range theory building. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",Authoritarianism; Classification of regimes; Cold War; Dictatorships; Elections; Hybrid regime,,,Cogitatio Press,21832463,,,,English,Polit.

We collected aquatic macroinvertebrates from 35 fishless prairie pothole wetlands in Alberta, including two habitat zones: the emergent zone and the open-water zone. Within each zone, we collected a vegetation sample and a water column sample, thus capturing four distinct microhabitats. We tested for community differences among these microhabitats with nested ANOVAs, looking at macroinvertebrate abundance, taxa richness, and evenness. We also visualized trends in community composition among the microhabitats with nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination. Interestingly, we observed no difference in macroinvertebrate communities between the open-water and the emergent habitat zones. However, we found significant differences in richness and evenness between water column and vegetation sample types nested within habitat zones. Additionally, we observed high taxonomic turnover between sample types. Our results emphasize the importance of within-zone microhabitats in structuring aquatic macroinvertebrate communities in prairie pothole wetlands, and the relative insignificance of emergent and open-water habitat zone distinctions. Future analyses of macroinvertebrates in wetlands should sample both the vegetation and the water column, regardless of habitat zone, to prevent biased surveys of macroinvertebrate communities. © 2017 The Author(s).

Four different grades of GnP are used to investigate the effect of GnP size on the anti-corrosion performance of the composites. Tafel, Nyquist, and Bode plots are used to quantify and compare the anti-corrosion performance of the composites, and these plots are obtained by electrochemical analysis. In addition to the anti-corrosion performance, mechanical properties and morphologies of the composites are analyzed. Various parameters indicating the anti-corrosion performance illustrate that smaller size of GnP in the composites shows higher anti-corrosion performance on copper substrate. The results show that the smaller size of GnP is not only uniformly dispersed within PU, but also offers a high surface area which helps construct an efficient filler pathway that suppresses the diffusion of a corrosive agent into the polymer matrix. Nevertheless, mechanical properties of the composites are partially improved. Essentially, this study demonstrates that the size of GnP plays a central role in determining the anti-corrosion performance of PU/GnP composites. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Bode diagrams; Filled polymers; Mechanical properties; Plastic bottles; Platelets; Polyurethanes; Substrates; Anticorrosion performance; Copper substrates; Corrosive agents; Different grades; Electrochemical analysis; High surface area; Nano-platelets; Polyethylene terephthalates (PET); Copper corrosion,,Royal Society of Chemistry,20462069,,RSCAC,,English,RSC Adv.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047426743,

For communities in the North and rural and remote communities in the South, the patterns of demographic change might be quite different from those faced by cities. There is also considerable diversity among these non-urban areas. Non-urban hinterlands that are within commuting distance of cities (high Metropolitan Influence) have been growing, with some being reclassified as parts of urban agglomerations. Population change in rural areas that are outside of urban influence is more closely related to employment dynamics in particular sectors, especially agriculture and resource extraction. Populations of many of those communities have been declining and aging, due to out-migration of young adults and a lack of immigration. In the North, where populations are younger, resource development has meant rapid change to Northern communities and cultures. Current challenges for Northern, rural, and remote communities include potential labour force skills shortages and adapting infrastructure to a changing population, in the context of difficult geography. Future issues related to population change have implications for social cohesion. In the North, there is a risk of widening socio-economic inequality, particularly between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. In the South, disparities in lifestyles and labour force experiences between rural and urban populations might also grow. Recommendations for knowledge development include more research on the effective recruitment and retention of professionals, including immigrants, in these areas, as well as better sources of data on Northern populations. © 2018, Canadian Population Society.",,,,Canadian Population Society,3801489,,,,English,Can.

Lifting guidelines focus on mitigating primarily limiting low back exposures, and the influence of these techniques on the shoulder is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To quantify shoulder loading during manual patient handling tasks and determine whether approaches intended to limit low back exposures negatively affect shoulder demands. METHODS: Twenty novice university-aged females completed five manual patient handling tasks before and after a training session. Participants simulated handling a partial weight bearing patient, and joint load magnitudes were calculated. Strength demands were interpreted in the context of available population capability ranges. RESULTS: Using recommended techniques decreased peak low back loading in most scenarios (p= 0.01-0.02), but had variable effects on shoulder loading. Peak loading in the shoulders increased by 97-107% in the Sit-to-Chair task following training. Using recommended techniques for Turn Toward decreased mean population strength requirements at the back to 35% of capability while increasing shoulder requirements to 100% capability. CONCLUSIONS: Recommended manual patient handling techniques mitigate low back exposures but likely transfer demands to other body regions, specifically the shoulder. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Controlling and eliminating this outer layer during thermal evaporation growth of GaP nanowires represents a barrier to simple and scalable preparation of this technologically important material. In this article, we systematically investigated the role of different parameters (temperature, hydrogen flow rate, and starting Ga/P ratio) in the synthesis of GaP nanowires, and mapped out the conditions for the growth of oxide-layer-free nanowires. Increase in temperature, hydrogen flow, and phosphorus concentration led to diminished oxide layer thickness and improved nanowire morphology. Long and straight nanowires with the near perfect stoichiometry and complete absence of oxide outer layer were obtained for 1050 °C, 100 sccm hydrogen flow rate, and Ga/P flux ratio of 0.5. In contrast to other reports, this work emphasizes the importance of introducing hydrogen flow and excess phosphorus, which provide for reducing environment and reduced rate of the reaction of Ga with O in the growth process, respectively. The ability to control dielectric medium around GaP NWs by controlling the formation of oxide overlayer was demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy. The results of this work demonstrate a full control of the multi-parameter space in the simple, inexpensive, and scalable synthesis of GaP NWs, and may provide a guideline for rational improvement of the growth conditions for other types of semiconductor nanowires. © 2018 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.",III-V nanowires; Native oxide; Phosphide; Physical vapor deposition; Semiconducting materials,,,AIMS Press,23720484,,,,English,AIMS Mat.

Malnutrition occurring in the hospital setting is caused by insufficient monitoring, identification, and assessment efforts. Furthermore, the ability of health care workers to identify and recognize malnourished patients is suboptimal. Therefore, interventions focusing on the identification and treatment of malnutrition are valuable, as they reduce the risks and rates of malnutrition within hospitals. Technology may be a particularly useful ally in identifying malnutrition due to scalability, timeliness, and effectiveness. In an effort to explore the issue, this scoping review synthesized the availability of technological tools to detect and identify hospital malnutrition. Objective: Our objective was to conduct a scoping review of the different forms of technology used in addressing malnutrition among adults admitted to hospital to (1) identify the extent of the published literature on this topic, (2) describe key findings, and (3) identify outcomes. Methods: We designed and implemented a search strategy in 3 databases (PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL). We completed a descriptive numerical summary and analyzed study characteristics. One reviewer independently extracted data from the databases. Results: We retrieved and reviewed a total of 21 articles. We categorized articles by the computerized tool or app type: malnutrition assessment (n=15), food intake monitoring (n=5), or both (n=1). Within those categories, we subcategorized the different technologies as either hardware (n=4), software (n=13), or both (n=4). An additional subcategory under software was cloud-based apps (n=1). Malnutrition in the acute hospital setting was largely an unrecognized problem, owing to insufficient monitoring, identification, and initial assessments of identifying both patients who are already malnourished and those who are at risk of malnourishment. Studies went on to examine the effectiveness of health care workers (nurses and doctors) with a knowledge base focused on clinical care and their ability to accurately and consistently identify malnourished geriatric patients within that setting. Conclusions: Most articles reported effectiveness in accurately increasing malnutrition detection and awareness. Computerized tools and apps may also help reduce health care workers' workload and time spent assessing patients for malnutrition. Hospitals may also benefit from implementing malnutrition technology through observing decreased length of stay, along with decreased foregone costs related to missing malnutrition diagnoses. It is beneficial to study the impact of these technologies to examine possible areas of improvement. A future systematic review would further contribute to the evidence and effectiveness of the use of technologies in assessing and monitoring hospital malnutrition.",Automated data; Food-intake monitoring; Hospital malnutrition; Malnutrition; Malnutrition assessment; Malnutrition detection; Nutrition assessment; Nutrition diagnosis; Nutritional status; Technology-driven health care,,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,14388871,,,,English,J.

To this end, sequentially presented target words, overlayed onto negative or neutral pictures, were studied in separate blocks (within-subjects) using a deep or shallow encoding instruction (between-subjects). Following study, in Test 1, participants completed separate recognition test blocks for the words overlayed onto the negative and the neutral contexts. Following this, in Test 2, participants completed a recognition test for the foils from each Test 1 block. We found a significant three-way interaction on Test 2, such that individuals with high anxiety who initially studied target words using a shallow encoding instruction, demonstrated significantly elevated memory for foils that were contained within the negative Test 1 block. Results show that during retrieval (Test 1), participants re-entered the mode of processing (negative or neutral) engaged at encoding, tainting the encoding of foils with that same mode of processing. The findings suggest that individuals with high relative to low anxiety, adopt a particularly salient negative retrieval mode, and this creates a downstream bias in encoding and subsequent retrieval of otherwise neutral information. © 2017 by the authors.",Anxiety; Context; Emotion; Memory; Recognition,adult; anxiety; article; human; information retrieval; memory bias,,MDPI AG,20763425,,,,English,Brain Sci.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040710708,

Integration of PEVs into the electric power system will result in a considerable addition to electricity demand. Due to PEV mobility, this demand has a random distribution in space and time among distribution system nodes. Therefore, short term forecast of PEV charging demand is more challenging than that for conventional loads. Assessment of PEV impacts on the power system is essential to mitigate the impairments from PEV loads. Optimal planning of PEV charging infrastructure will promote the penetration rate of PEVs and minimize the negative impacts of PEVs on the electric power distribution system and transportation road network. Design of charging facilities with integrated distributed energy resources (DER) is considered a solution to alleviate strain on the grid, reduce the integration cost with the distribution network and the charging cost. In this paper, we present a comprehensive literature survey on modelling of PEV charging demand, impact assessment approaches and tools, and charging infrastructure planning. Moreover, an overview on charging facility design with integrated DER is given. Some future research directions are identified. © 2017 by the authors.

We previously found that caspase-2 activity increases during skeletal muscle cell differentiation; however, its direct effect on differentiation has not been fully investigated. Here, we found that caspase-2 activity transiently increased more than two-fold within 24 h following induction of differentiation. Both pharmacological inhibition and shRNA-mediated knockdown of caspase-2 suppressed myogenic differentiation and dramatically impaired myotube formation. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown prevented induction of p21 and altered cell cycle profiles. Interestingly, caspase-3 activity was also dramatically reduced following caspase-2 inhibition or ablation. Moreover, caspase-2 and p21 were localized to the nucleus during early differentiation. Given the nuclear localization of caspase-2 and p21, as well as the impairment in p21 induction in caspase-2 knockdown cells, we propose that the role of caspase-2 is to regulate p21 induction at the onset of differentiation, which may regulate the myogenic program. Collectively, these results highlight a novel function for caspase-2 in myocyte differentiation and myogenesis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"actin; caspase; caspase 2; caspase 3; histone H2B; manganese superoxide dismutase; MyoD protein; myogenin; myosin; myosin heavy chain; procaspase 2; protein; protein p21; protein precursor; short hairpin RNA; unclassified drug; Casp2 protein, mouse; caspase 2; animal cell; Article; C2C12 cell line; cell cycle G0 phase; cell cycle G1 phase; cell cycle G2 phase; cell cycle M phase; cell cycle regulation; cell cycle S phase; cell differentiation; cell nucleus; cellular distribution; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; gene silencing; mouse; muscle development; myotube; nonhuman; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; skeletal muscle; skeletal muscle cell; skeletal myoblast; animal; cell culture; genetics; metabolism; muscle development; physiology; skeletal muscle; Animals; Caspase 2; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Mice; Muscle Development; Muscle Fibers, Skeletal; Muscle, Skeletal",,Elsevier B.V.,1674889,,BAMRD,28765049,English,Biochim.

Shortly after beginning the task, color identification responses become faster on the high-contingency trials than on the low-contingency trialsthe contingency learning effect. Across five groups, we varied the high-contingency proportion in 10% steps, from 80% to 40%. The size of the contingency learning effect was positively related to high-contingency proportion, with the effect disappearing when high contingency was reduced to 40%. At the two highest contingency proportions, the magnitude of the effect increased over trials, the pattern suggesting that there was an increasing cost for the low-contingency trials rather than an increasing benefit for the high-contingency trials.

It is not clear whether the estimation of durations that are instead defined by our own mental processes (e.g., response times) is underlain by the same mechanisms. Across five experiments, we tested whether the pattern of interference between concurrent temporal and nontemporal tasks was similar for the two types of intervals. Duration estimation of externally defined intervals slowed performance on a concurrent equation verification task, regardless of whether participants were required to report their estimate by clicking within an analogue scale or by reproducing the duration. Estimation of internally defined durations did not slow equation verification performance when an analogue scale response was required. The results suggest that estimation of internally defined durations may not depend on the effortful temporal processing that is required to estimate externally defined durations. © 2017, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",attention and executive control; Attention: Divided Attention and Inattention,female; human; male; mental function; physiology; reaction time; task performance; time perception; young adult; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Processes; Reaction Time; Task Performance and Analysis; Time Perception; Young Adult,,Springer New York LLC,19433921,,,28929401,English,Atten.

Modifications to a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) apparatus were investigated with the aim to generate localized fluid cavitation and measure the cavitation threshold of fluids. The proposed design incorporated a novel closed cavitation chamber to generate localized cavitation resulting from a reflected compression pulse, which was generated by a spherical steel striker and Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) incident bar. A numerical model of the incident bar was developed and validated with 24 independent tests (cross-correlation: 0.9700.997), and this was extended to a numerical model of the apparatus including the chamber, validated with 27 independent tests (cross-correlation: 0.921) to predict the tensile fluid pressure in the chamber. Tests on distilled water were performed with comparable numerical results for the chamber strain (R2: 0.875) and chamber end-wall velocity (R2: 0.992). The pressure in the chamber was determined from the model to avoid introducing a nucleation site via a pressure gauge, and was verified with a first-order approximation showing good agreement (R2: 0.892). The 50% probability of cavitation for distilled water was ?3.32 MPa ±3%, comparable to values in the literature. This novel apparatus, including a closed confinement chamber integrated with a polymeric SHPB apparatus was able to create localized fluid cavitation with loading comparable to blast exposure. Future studies will include the measurement of CSF cavitation pressure. © 2017, The Author(s).",Cavitation; Mild traumatic brain injury; Negative pressure; PMMA modelling; Polymer split Hopkinson pressure bar,Brain; Bridge decks; Cavitation; Numerical models; Polymers; Polymethyl methacrylates; Cavitation thresholds; Cerebro spinal fluids; First-order approximations; Mild traumatic brain injuries; Negative pressures; Physical measurement; Polymer split Hopkinson pressure bar; Split Hopkinson pressure bars; Cerebrospinal fluid,,Springer New York LLC,144851,,EXMCA,,English,Exp.

Methods Volumetric OCT images of the superior and inferior limbus were acquired from 14 healthy subjects with a research-grade UHR-OCT system. Differences in vessel diameter and depth between superior and inferior limbus were analyzed using repeated measured ANOVA in SPSS and R. Results The mean (± SD) superior and inferior diameters were 29 ± 18 ?m and 24 ± 18 ?m respectively, and the mean (± SD) superior and inferior depths were 177 ± 109 ?m and 207 ± 132 ?m respectively. The superior limbal vessels were larger than the inferior ones (RM-ANOVA, p = 0.004), and the inferior limbal vessels were deeper than the superior vessels (RM-ANOVA, p = 0.041). There was a positive linear association between limbal vessel depth and size within the superior and inferior limbus with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.803 and 0.754, respectively. Conclusion This study demonstrated that the UHR-OCT was capable of imaging morphometric characteristics such as the size and depth of vessels in the limbus. The results of this study suggest a difference in the size and depth of vessels across different positions of the limbus, which may be indicative of adaptations to chronic hypoxia caused by the covering of the superior limbus by the upper eyelid. UHR-OCT may be a useful tool to evaluate the effect of contact lenses on the microvascular properties within the limbus. © 2017 Spanish General Council of Optometry",Corneal imaging; Limbal vasculature; Optical coherence tomography; Optical imaging; Repeatability,"adolescent; adult; anatomy and histology; cornea epithelium; cornea limbus; female; human; image enhancement; male; middle aged; normal human; optical coherence tomography; procedures; reproducibility; sclera; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Epithelium, Corneal; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Image Enhancement; Limbus Corneae; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Sclera; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Young Adult",,Spanish Council of Optometry,18884296,,,28629902,English; Spanish,J.

Moving well beyond more organizationally-based understandings of managers and management, it examines the pragmatic accomplishment of management activities and the generic social processes that accompany them. This work addresses diverse issues related to management such as: holding and doing office, pursuing cooperation, developing policy, envisioning and advocating for missions, establishing teams and generating team identities, sustaining team endeavors and managing self.

In order to deal with uncertainties and multiple attributes in wastewater treatment, an intuitionistic fuzzy set is employed to evaluate wastewater treatment plans effectively. A distance measure is defined to obtain an objective weight measuring the experts judgment. More specifically, experts first use group decision-making on the various plans with an intuitionistic fuzzy set. Meanwhile, Due to the decision-makers psychological behavior, the prospect theory is applied. Next, the various plans are ranked by The Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method and prospect theory.

Although some suburbs have long been punctuated with high-rise developments, for instance rental apartments in the Canadian context, there are now a growing number of new high-rise condominium developments in suburban settings in both the US and Canada. While much is known about downtown high-rise condominium developments, there has of yet been little to no analysis of this trend in the suburbs. We offer such an analysis using Statistics Canada census data from 2016 in the Toronto metropolitan area. We focus on commuting patterns as an indicator of auto-dependence to test whether suburbs with larger shares of new high-rise condominium apartments (high-rise condo clusters) exhibit lower shares of auto commuting. The focus on auto-dependence is important because development and land use plans commonly use environmental concerns arising from heavy automobile use as a rationale for high-rise development. Our findings suggest that in Toronto suburban high-rise condo clusters offer a less auto-intensive way of living in the suburbs than traditionally has been the case in the suburban ownership market. However, this seems to be limited to particular demographic groups, such as smaller households; and suburban high-rise condos are not an evident sign of a broader transition toward suburban sustainability among the population as a whole in the Toronto case. The potential for transitions toward suburban sustainability could be enhanced with greater investments in transit infrastructure and building higher density mid-rise and ground-oriented dwellings that accommodate larger households still commonly found in low-density, auto-dependent suburbs. © 2018 by the authors.",Automobility; Condominium; High-rise development; Homeownership; Suburbs; Sustainability; Toronto,,,Cogitatio Press,21837635,,,,English,Urban Planning,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059223306,

Regarding this, this paper proposes a new interconnection architecture for distributed DCNs by way of passive optical network (PON) technology to construct a ubiquitous cloud computing (UCC) environment with high scalability, resiliency, and data locality. A novel de-centralized architecture of virtualized mega DCNs on customized next-generation PONs (NGPONs) to provision UCC is proposed under the name of NGPON-DCN. In addition, a cost-effective deployment design framework and an associated revenue-driven elastic infrastructure-as-a-service delivery model are specified for creation and operation of such NGPON-DCN, followed by a discussion of anticipated key research challenges and optimization opportunities in this new NGPON-DCN convergence paradigm. © 2013 IEEE.",Cloud computing; datacenters; IoT services; passive optical networks,Cloud computing; Cost effectiveness; Internet of things; Network architecture; Network security; Passive networks; Passive optical networks; Ubiquitous computing; Centralized architecture; Data center networks; Data centers; Intelligent Services; Interconnection architecture; Iot services; Passive Optical Network (PON); Real-time intelligence; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS),,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058099110,

Within thermally disturbed ecosystems, climatically driven changes to hydrology and temperature regimes have the potential to modify nutrient cycling processes. To assess the impacts of changing moisture and thermal conditions on the mineralization of nutrients in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, subarctic Canada, soil cores were extracted along gradients of moisture and topographic position (peat plateaus, sedge lawns, channel fens, and thermokarst collapse scars). Soil subsamples were then subjected to a factorial design of temperature (4°C, 12°C, and 20°C) and moisture treatments (saturated, field moist, and air dried) in oxic conditions for three weeks. Nitrogen transformation rates were highly variable across landscape units (ranging from ?1 to 96 ?g N-NO3 ? and from ?53 to 73 ?g N-NH4 + g?1 dry soil for the incubation period). Shoreline collapse scar material showed the greatest potential for nitrification, with rates two orders of magnitude higher than other landscape positions, under warm (20°C) and saturated conditions.

PVA is an ocular lubricant that can be found in multiple formulations of artificial tears. Nelfilcon A innately contains PVA, so only the release of PVA from this lens was evaluated. Etafilcon A and omafilcon A lenses were incubated in a PBS solution containing PVA. The release of PVA was evaluated using a novel in vitro blink platform with Milli-Q water and PBS under various blink conditions and flow rates. Nelfilcon A lenses significantly released more PVA than other lenses at 0.5 and 1.5 h in both PBS and Milli-Q water (p < 0.001). For nelfilcon A, there was no statistical significance between the release profiles of PVA between the blink and no-blink conditions, or for the various flow rates (p > 0.05). All tested groups and lenses showed a burst release within the first 4.5 h and rapidly plateaued thereafter. The current study demonstrates that releasable PVA (whether through uptake or through being inherently available from the material) is loosely bound on hydrogel lenses, and the majority is released within 4.5 h. © 2018 The Authors.

First, different oils from different plant sources were compared to see the degree of conversion in trans-esterification reaction and the purity of bio-diesel produced. Second, micro-reactor is proposed as an alternative to conventional, batch reactor in producing biodiesel. The results show that soybean oil gives the highest conversion among other oils. Process simulation using COMSOL shows that using micro-reactor can cut the reaction time to 25 minutes; much shorter than the time needed by batch reactor which is 60 minutes.

Especially, the local and global hydrodynamic resistance changes caused by droplets make the task to develop a robust microfluidic design challenging as plenty of interdependencies which all affect the intended behavior have to be considered by the designer. After the design, its functionality is usually validated by fabricating a prototype and testing it with physical experiments. In case that the functionality is not implemented as desired, the designer has to go back, revise the design, and repeat the fabrication as well as experiments. This current design process based on multiple iterations of refining and testing the design produces high costs (financially as well as in terms of time). In this work, we show how a significant amount of those costs can be avoided when applying simulation before fabrication. To this end, we demonstrate how simulations on the 1D circuit analysis model can help in the design process by means of a case study. Therefore, we compare the design process with and without using simulation. As a case study, we use a microfluidic network which is capable of trapping and merging droplets with different content on demand. The case study demonstrates how simulation can help to validate the derived design by considering all local and global hydrodynamic resistance changes. Moreover, the simulations even allow further exploration of different designs which have not been considered before due to the high costs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Drops; Fabrication; Hydrodynamics; Microfluidics; Applied pressure; Channel network; Droplet microfluidics; Functional performance; Hydrodynamic resistance; Microfluidic networks; Multiple iterations; Physical experiments; Design,,Royal Society of Chemistry,20462069,,RSCAC,,English,RSC Adv.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054821783,

The CFM model is used to simulate water intrusion into a dry GDL microstructure obtained from ?-CT. Numerical water saturation distributions are compared to experimental ?-CT reconstructions of the same GDL sample at varying saturation levels. A quantitative validation of the CFM model results is then provided by studying the number of voxels in the image that contain water in both the CFMmodel results and the ?-CT reconstructions. Results reveal that CFM simulations showed 56-95.7% agreement in the liquid water voxels when compared to the ?-CT simulations for saturations in the range of 29-92.3%. Gas transport simulations are then performed on ?-CT and CFM partially saturated GDLs in order to study the validity of the CFM model images to estimate transport properties of partially saturated GDLs. A maximum error of 20% was observed between the predicted effective diffusivities obtained from CFM simulations and those obtained directly from simulations on the ?-CT data for saturations below 40%. Effective diffusivity predictions from the CFM simulations agree well with in-plane effective diffusivities in literature while the through-plane effective diffusivities were underpredicted by a factor of 2. © The Author(s) 2018.,,Diffusion in gases; Fuel cells; Repair; CT reconstruction; Effective diffusivities; Gas diffusion media; Partially saturated; Quantitative validation; Saturation levels; Water intrusions; Water saturations; Computerized tomography,,Electrochemical Society Inc.,134651,,JESOA,,English,J Electrochem Soc,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054742270,

While deep neural networks have been demonstrated in recent years to provide the state-of-the-art performance traffic sign recognition, a key challenge for enabling the widespread deployment of deep neural networks for embedded traffic sign recognition is the high computational and memory requirements of such networks. As a consequence, there are significant benefits in investigating compact deep neural network architectures for traffic sign recognition that are better suited for embedded devices. In this paper, we introduce MicronNet, a highly compact deep convolutional neural network for real-time embedded traffic sign recognition designed based on macroarchitecture design principles (e.g., spectral macroarchitecture augmentation, parameter precision optimization, etc.) as well as numerical microarchitecture optimization strategies. The resulting overall architecture of MicronNet is thus designed with as few parameters and computations as possible while maintaining recognition performance, leading to optimized information density of the proposed network. The resulting MicronNet possesses a model size of just 1 MB and 5 10 000 parameters (? 27× fewer parameters than state-of-the-art) while still achieving a human performance level top-1 accuracy of 98.9% on the German traffic sign recognition benchmark. Furthermore, the MicronNet requires just 10 million multiply-accumulate operations to perform inference, and has a time-to-compute of just 32.19 ms on a Cortex-A53 high efficiency processor. These experimental results show that the highly compact, optimized deep neural network architectures can be designed for real-time traffic sign recognition that are well-suited for embedded scenarios. © 2018 IEEE.",Deep neural network; embedded; real-time; traffic sign classification,Benchmarking; Computer architecture; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Embedded systems; Interactive computer systems; Neural networks; Optimization; Pattern recognition; Real time systems; Traffic signs; Convolutional neural network; Deep convolutional neural networks; embedded; Intelligent transportation; Micro architectures; Multiply accumulate operations; Real time; State-of-the-art performance; Network architecture,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054493555,

The assumption of uncorrelated observation errors is attractive because the errors can be represented by a diagonal observation error covariance matrix, which is inexpensive to invert. In this paper a set of idealized experiments are carried out to investigate the impact of this assumption on sea ice analyses. A background error covariance matrix is generated using a 1D toy model for sea, i.e. forced with idealized models of the ocean and atmosphere. Analysis error covariance matrices are then calculated using this B matrix for both correlated and uncorrelated observation error covariance matrices, R. The results indicate when the true R is correlated, using a diagonal approximation results in an analysis that is overconfident at the large scales, in that the analysis error standard deviation at the large scales is underestimated. It is also shown that for the largest observation error correlation length scale tested, 150 km, the analysis error standard deviation for ice thickness is reduced by 10.8% relative to the background error standard deviation when R has the correct correlation length scale of 150 km, whereas when a diagonal approximation to R is used in combination with an inflation factor, the reduction is to 6.3%. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

But such meaning has always proven computationally allusive. It is often implicit, 'hidden' meaning, evoked by linguistic cues, stylistic arrangement, or conceptual structure - features that have hitherto been difficult for Natural Language Processing systems to recognize and use. Non-denotative textual effects are the historical concern of rhetorical studies, and we have turned to rhetoric in order to find new ways to advance NLP, especially for sophisticated tasks like Argument Mining. This paper highlights certain rhetorical devices that encode levels of meaning that have been overlooked in Computational Linguistics generally and Argument Mining particularly, and yet lend themselves to automated detection. These devices are the linguistic configurations known as Rhetorical Figures. We argue for the importance of these devices for Argument Mining, especially in collocations, and we present an XML annotation scheme for Rhetorical Figures to make figuration more tractable for computational approaches, particularly with an eye on the improvements they offer Argument Mining. We also discuss the intellectual and technical challenges involved in figure annotation and the implications for Machine Learning. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.",annotation; argument mining; Rhetoric; rhetorical figures; XML,Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linguistics; XML; annotation; Annotation scheme; Automated detection; Computational approach; Conceptual structures; Rhetoric; rhetorical figures; Technical challenges; Natural language processing systems,,IOS Press,19462166,,,,English,Argum.

In this paper, the car-following model is introduced to describe the distribution of vehicles, and an EDCA-based linear VANET model is analyzed. Compared to previous works, a tighter transmission capacity upper bound in a large-scale fading environment is calculated. Furthermore, under Rayleigh fading channels, an elementary expression of transmission capacity fitting a sparse vehicles scenario and an upper bound of transmission capacity applicable to a dense scenario are obtained. In conclusion, the transmission capacity of a linear VANET is illustrated by the elementary expression in a sparse vehicles scenario and the upper bound in a dense vehicles scenario. The simulation results are well constrained by the proposed theoretical expression and upper bound. © 2013 IEEE.",Car-following model; EDCA; transmission capacity; VANET,Fading channels; Rayleigh fading; Vehicle transmissions; Car following models; EDCA; Enhanced distributed channel access; Fading environment; Realistic model; Theoretical expression; Transmission capacities; VANET; Vehicular ad hoc networks,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047981844,

It is found that the cycling of water intrusion-evaporation processes significantly contributes to the growth of agglomerates as well as the formation of pinholes and cracks, causing irreversible losses of active surface areas and catalytic activity; in contrast, the cycling of water flow-through-dehydration experiments enlarges the large pores but changes very little the agglomerate sizes. This is because water tends to flow through the path of least resistance, that is, the large pores in the catalyst layers, leaving the other parts of the catalyst layers with relatively small pores less affected.

Once the cost is determined, compare it with the costs of operating other laboratories in the same hospital, and operating anatomic pathology laboratories in other countries. Methods: Cost and workload data were obtained from hospital records for 2015. Time allocation of staff between laboratory testing and other activities was determined using assumptions from published workload studies. Results: The laboratory received 20,093 cases for testing in 2015, and total expenditures were US $1.20 million, ie, $61.97 per case. The anatomic pathology laboratory accounted for 5.2% of the laboratory budget at the hospital, compared to 64.3% for the clinical laboratory and 30.5% for the microbiology laboratory. We provide comparisons to a similar laboratory in the United States. Conclusions: Anatomic pathology is more costly than other hospital laboratories due to the labor-intensive work, but is essential, particularly for cancer diagnoses and treatment. © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

It has been argued that the FTV bias depends on recognising the stimulus as a person. Accordingly, reducing the social relevance of biological motion by presenting stimuli upside down has been shown to reduce FTV bias. Here, we replicated the experiment that reported this finding and added stick figure walkers to the task in order to assess the effect of explicit shape information on facing bias for inverted figures. We measured the FTV bias for upright and inverted stick figure walkers and point-light walkers presented in different azimuth orientations. Inversion of the stimuli did not reduce facing direction judgements to chance levels. In fact, we observed a significant facing away bias in the inverted stimulus conditions. In addition, we found no difference in the pattern of data between stick figure and point-light walkers. Although the results are broadly consistent with previous findings, we do not conclude that inverting biological motion simply negates the FTV bias; rather, inversion causes stimuli to be seen facing away from the viewer more often than not. The results support the interpretation that primarily low-level visual processes are responsible for the biases produced by both upright and inverted stimuli. © The Author(s) 2018.",Biological motion; Facing-the-viewer bias; Inversion effect; Perceptual ambiguity,,,SAGE Publications Ltd,20416695,,,,English,i-Perception,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041417590,

We contend that the timing of pregnancy is a socially constructed norm that impacts women through a complex range of life events and circumstances. Participants accounts suggest a gamut of compliance, ambivalence, and defiance towards the timing of pregnancy standards. Situating womens decisions on childbearing within the continuum of their life trajectories and societal expectations surrounding pregnancy allows for better understanding of the interplay between womens personal choices and the social norms informing these decisions. © 2018 QSR.",Planned and unplanned pregnancy; Pregnancy; Timing; Transition to motherhood; Womens interpretations,,,Lodz University,17338077,,,,English,Qual.

We tested the hypothesis that these interindividual differences were associated with differences in exercising muscle deoxygenation and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) across a range of submaximal exercise intensities. A total of 31 (21 ± 3 years) healthy recreationally active males performed an incremental exercise test to exhaustion 24 h following a resting muscle biopsy. Cardiac output (Q L/min; inert gas rebreathe), oxygen uptake (VO2 L/min; breath-by-breath pulmonary gas exchange), quadriceps saturation (near infrared spectroscopy) and exercise tolerance (620; Borg Scale RPE) were measured. The Q-VO2 relationship from 40 to 160 W was used to partition individuals post hoc into higher (n = 10; 6.3 ± 0.4) versus lower (n = 10; 3.7 ± 0.4, P &lt; 0.001) responders. The Q-VO2 difference between responder types was not explained by arterial oxygen content differences (P = 0.5) or peripheral skeletal muscle characteristics (P from 0.1 to 0.8) but was strongly associated with stroke volume (P &lt; 0.05). Despite considerable Q-VO2 difference between groups, no difference in quadriceps deoxygenation was observed during exercise (all P &gt; 0.4). Lower cardiac responders had greater leg (P = 0.027) and whole body (P = 0.03) RPE only at 185 W, but this represented a higher %peak VO2 in lower cardiac responders (87 ± 15% vs. 66 ± 12%, P = 0.005). Substantially lower Q-VO2 in the lower responder group did not result in altered RPE or exercising muscle deoxygenation. This suggests substantial recruitment of blood flow redistribution in the lower responder group as part of protecting matching of exercising muscle oxygen delivery to demand. © 2018 The Authors.

The hydrothermal vent complex, from which these sheared alteration zones originated, was stacked together with the ore horizon by W-vergent thrust faults during an early collisional deformation regime, imbricating molasse-type clastic sediments with the ore-hosting volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of the Flin Flon arc assemblage. Chlorite-rich planar zones marked by high values of the Carbonate-chlorite-pyrite index (CCPI) are laterally more extensive and outline a later system of ductile shear zones, in which phyllosilicates, quartz and chalcopyrite in stringer zones localized shear strain and enhanced transposition of the hydrothermal vent stockwork. The contrasting deformation styles of these two thrusting events and their localization within the ore horizon and hydrothermal vent stockwork have important implications for vectoring towards undiscovered ore in this mature mining camp that are possibly also relevant to other strongly deformed VMS ore systems. © 2017 by the authors.

As a result, this paper presents a novel hydraulic/electric synergy powertrain with multiple working modes. The three energy sources (i.e., engine, battery, and hydraulic accumulator) in this configuration are regulated by a dual planetary gear set to achieve optimal performances. This paper selects the component sizes of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), a hydraulic hybrid vehicle (HHV), and a hydraulic/electric synergy vehicle (HESV), based on the dynamic performance of a target vehicle (TV). In addition, this paper develops the forward simulation models of the four aforementioned vehicles in the MATLAB/Simulink/Driveline platform, in which the fuel economy simulations are carried out in relation to the Chinese urban bus cycle. The simulation results show that the fuel consumption of the three hybrid vehicles is similar, but much better than, that of the TV. Finally, based on the operating cost calculations over a five-year working period, the lowest cost ranges of the three hybrid vehicles are determined, which provides a method for choosing the optimal hybrid scheme. © 2017 by the authors.",Battery; Hybrid energy sources; Hydraulic accumulator; Power split,Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Hydraulic accumulators; MATLAB; Powertrains; Battery; Dynamic performance; Environmental pollutions; Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV); Hybrid energy sources; Hydraulic hybrid vehicles; Optimal performance; Power splits; Hybrid vehicles,,MDPI AG,19961073,,,,English,Energies,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040584766,

These shifting socio-demographic patterns have resulted in the rapid development of cosmopolitan urban centres where difference and diversity are ubiquitous (Sandercock, 2003). However, as ethnic enclaves form outside the urban core in suburban communities, there is uncertainty about whether cultural homogeneity is desirable or sustainable in a multicultural country. Indeed, planning communities for increasing diversity and difference will remain, what Leonie Sandercock (2004) calls, one of the greatest tasks for planners of the 21st century. Thus, this article uses the theory of hyper-diversity to illuminate how immigrants interactions with their local suburban community represents cultural pluralism and diversity beyond ethnicity. Specifically, this study explores differing attitudes, activities and lifestyles among diverse immigrant populations in the Region of Peel, one of the fastest growing and most culturally diverse areas in Canada. Focus groups with 60 immigrant youth and 55 immigrant adults were conducted to qualitatively capture perspectives and experiences in ethnic enclaves. The findings highlight the existence of attitudes in favor of multicultural lifestyles, activities that take newcomers beyond the borders of their enclaves, and lifestyles that require additional infrastructure to support sustainability of immigration in the suburbs. In conclusion, this article adds to the debate on cultural pluralism and homogeneous ethnic enclaves by using the emergent concept of hyper-diversity as a way to think about the future sustainability of suburbs in an era of global migration. © 2018 by the authors.",Belonging; Hyper-diversity; Immigration; Inclusion; Social planning; Suburbs,,,Cogitatio Press,21837635,,,,English,Urban Planning,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059229896,

We first outline the changing organization of games work, the shift towards so-called indie production, and the associated rejection of creatively constrained, hierarchically managed production models. In the move towards small-scale games making, indies jettisoned producers because producers represented industry modes of work, values and creative constraints. But indies are now struggling to manage production processes without producers. We use developer narratives to highlight how this missing producer work is redistributed in the form of cultural entrepreneurship, cultural intermediation and relational labour. This relational labour simultaneously supports and undermines sustainable production practices, as developers take on impossible workloads associated with networking and connecting with others. We next illustrate how the inherent valorization of growth and expansion in cultural entrepreneurship discourses may force developers to mimic industry practices and organization in order to find funding, but these practices inherently conflict with their desire to focus on making games as small, sustainable and creatively autonomous teams. Ultimately, we want to demonstrate how interviews and time spent with indie developers help us account for otherwise invisible and ambiguous cultural labour practices and discourses, thus allowing us to make sense of the larger context of cultural production and its possible futures. © The Author(s) 2018.",Cultural entrepreneurship; cultural intermediaries; cultural production; game development; indie games; precarity; relational labour; sustainability; indie entrepreneur,,,SAGE Publications Ltd,13675494,,,,English,Eur.

In the developed western countries, evidence suggests that 80% of premature deaths and disability due to diabetes and heart disease can be prevented. Diabetes care in the elderly include further challenges in management of comorbidities such as hypertension, the metabolic syndrome (MetS), kidney problems including nephropathy and chronic renal failure, vision abnormalities such as cataract and retinopathy. The comorbidities are subsequent to complex mechanistic processes incurred by the hyperglycemia and reduced insulin sensitivity in diabetes. Management of diabetic elderly patients with type 2 diabetes is further challenged by lack of specific clinical guidelines tailored to this population. Existing clinical guidelines are based on evidence from clinical trials conducted in younger ( < 65 years of age) patients. There is a need for designing improved models of health care delivery, assessment of comorbidities and polypharmacy in elderly men, including mental health issues such as depression and dementia that may persist with diabetes.

Focusing specifically on Schwarzschild black holes, we have re-calculated and re-assessed the greybody factors using a path-ordered-exponential approach, a technique which has the virtue of providing a pedagogically useful semi-explicit formula for the relevant Bogoliubov coefficients. These path-ordered-exponentials, being based on a variant of the transfer matrix formalism, are closely related to so-called product integrals, leading to quite straightforward and direct numerical evaluation, while side-stepping any need for numerically solving the relevant ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, while considerable analytic information is already available regarding both the high-frequency and low-frequency asymptotics of these greybody factors, numerical approaches seem better adapted to finding suitable global models for these greybody factors in the intermediate frequency regime, where most of the Hawking flux is actually concentrated. Working in a more general context, these path-ordered-exponential techniques are also likely to be of interest for generic barrier-penetration problems. © 2018 by the authors.",Barrier penetration; Bogoliubov coefficients; Cross section; Greybody factor; Hawking flux; Regge-Wheeler potential,,,MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,22181997,,,,English,Universe,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056851032,

By utilizing the incorporation of a new integral inequality technique and a novel LyapunovKrasovskii functional, some reduced conservative delay-dependent stability conditions for asymptotic stability are established. Then some special cases of neutral systems are discussed. Based on these delay-dependent stability conditions, the condition for robustness is obtained for uncertain linear delayed systems. All these stability conditions are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can easily be computed by the LMI toolbox of Matlab. Finally, several examples are discussed in detail to display the usefulness and superiority of the obtained results. © 2018, The Author(s).",Delay-dependent stability; Linear matrix inequalities; Lyapunov functional; Robust stability; Uncertain neutral delayed system,,,Springer International Publishing,10255834,,,,English,J.

In smartphones, most energy issues are due to energy bugs (ebugs). These ebugs are said to be exist when smartphone software applications (apps) consume more power than expected while executing, or they continue to consume energy even after these apps are closed or terminated. In this research, we introduce the concept of application tail energy bugs (ATEBs) and provide an operational definition for it. Then, we discuss about the main potential causes of ATEBs and the user actions that can trigger them. To provide a proof of concept, we conduct experiments using real Android apps. To identify all the scenarios that can cause ATEBs, we develop a testing app and perform 32 experiments. The main goal of the experiments is to check the behavior of app components, such as activities and services in the presence/absence of four different types of wakelocks. Then, we discuss the relationship between software changes and energy consumption by tracing wakelocks that keep the device awake and services that might be engaging the CPU. The power consumption of the app is measured using the monsoon power meter. Because power meters are not often available to software developers, we design a tool to detect ATEBs. This tool utilizes Android debug bridge (adb) commands to extract system-related information. The tool effectiveness is evaluated using five Android apps. © 2018 IEEE.",Energy bug; energy efficiency; software testing,Android (operating system); Anthropomorphic robots; Application programs; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Green computing; Hand held computers; Optical parametric oscillators; Smartphones; Software testing; Solar cells; Tools; Androids; Computer bugs; energy bug; Humanoid robot; Power demands; Program debugging,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055719651,

Despite some constructability complications, integrated connection could be a reliable solution. In this paper, the structural behaviour of an integrated connection for implementation between adjacent composite sandwich panels in rapid assembly buildings is studied. The integrated connection system consists of 3-D high density polyethylene (HDPE) skin faces, and cores of high-density polyurethane (PUR) foam integrated into the sandwich panels at the moment of their production. The study included experimental investigations regarding the mechanical and structural response of the connection under actual applied loads, and its torsional rigidity, rotational stiffness and behaviour under lateral loading is investigated. Using Finite Element modelling, the stress distribution and the mechanisms of failure are studied. The results show a good agreement between the numerical and experimental results. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada, 2018 Growing Science Ltd.

In the interest of providing a similar proof complexity-theoretic analysis of satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers, we introduce a generalization of resolution called Res(T). We show that many of the known results comparing resolution and CDCL solvers lift to the SMT setting, such as the result of Pipatsrisawat and Darwiche showing that CDCL solvers with perfect non-deterministic branching and an asserting clause-learning scheme can polynomially simulate general resolution. We also describe a stronger version of Res(T), Res* (T), capturing SMT solvers allowing introduction of new literals. We analyze the theory EUF of equality with uninterpreted functions, and show that the Res*(EUF) system is able to simulate an earlier calculus introduced by Bjørner and de Moura for the purpose of analyzing DPLL (EUF). Further, we show that Res*(EUF) (and thus SMT algorithms with clause learning over EUF, new literal introduction rules and perfect branching) can simulate the Frege proof system, which is well-known to be far more powerful than resolution. Finally, we prove under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) that any reduction from EUF to SAT (such as the Ackermann reduction) must, in the worst case, produce an instance of size ?(nlog n) from an instance of size n. © The Author(s) 2018.",,Calculations; Computer aided analysis; Formal logic; Clause learning; Exponential time hypothesis; Frege proofs; Proof complexity; Resolution proofs; Satisfiability modulo Theories; Theoretic analysis; Uninterpreted Functions; Computer circuits,Weissenbacher G.Chockler H.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Fatigue tests were conducted on both unidirectional and cross-ply specimens at room temperature. The S-N diagram of [0]8 followed a bilinear curve, however, the [90]8 laminates presented a linear S-N diagram. Compared to the same lamination of glass/epoxy, [0]8 and [90]8 glass/polyamide laminates presented a lower fatigue resistance, while [02/902]s laminates exhibited a superior fatigue resistance. In addition, stiffness degradation was investigated for the laminates and was compared with that of glass/epoxy with the same lamination. Glass/polyamide composites had lower stiffness reduction compared to glass/epoxy. During fatigue tests, an infrared (IR) camera was also used to monitor the temperature rise in [02/902]s and [04/904]s laminates resulting from mechanical cyclic loading, and to capture the temperature profile associated with the failure area in the specimens. The maximum temperature in [04/904]s laminates was comparable to that of [02/902]s laminates and the final temperature in some of the cross-ply specimens reached 50 °C, which was near the glass transition temperature of the polyamide matrix. © 2018 The Authors.

In many cases, individual processes are isomorphic, but there is insufficient global symmetry to simplify model checking. This work considers the verification of local properties, those defined over the neighborhood of a process. Considerably generalizing earlier results on invariance, it is shown that all local mu-calculus properties, including safety and liveness properties, are preserved by neighborhood symmetries. Hence, it suffices to check them locally over a set of representative process neighborhoods. In general, local verification approximates verification over the global state space; however, if process interactions are outward-facing, the relationship is shown to be exact. For many network topologies, even those with little global symmetry, analysis with representatives provides a significant, even exponential, reduction in the cost of verification. Moreover, it is shown that for network families generated from building-block patterns, neighborhood symmetries are easily determined, and verification over the entire family reduces to verification over a finite set of representative process neighborhoods. © The Author(s) 2018.",,Calculations; Temporal logic; Building blockes; Global symmetries; Large networks; Liveness properties; Network topology; Process interaction; State explosion; Symmetry reduction; Model checking,Beyer D.Huisman M.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

A leading hypothesis is that ALS is caused by toxic protein misfolding and aggregation, as also occurs in many other neurodegenerative disorders, such as prion, Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and Huntingtons diseases. A prominent cause of familial ALS is mutations in the protein superoxide dismutase (SOD1), which promote the formation of misfolded SOD1 conformers that are prone to aberrant interactions both with each other and with other cellular components. We have shown previously that immature SOD1, lacking bound Cu and Zn metal ions and the intrasubunit disulfide bond (apoSOD12SH), has a rugged free-energy surface (FES) and exchanges with four other conformations (excited states) that have millisecond lifetimes and sparse populations on the order of a few percent. Here, we examine further states of SOD1 along its maturation pathway, as well as those off-pathway resulting from metal loss that have been observed in proteinaceous inclusions. Metallation and disulfide bond formation lead to structural transformations including local ordering of the electrostatic loop and native dimerization that are observed in rare conformers of apoSOD12SH; thus, SOD1 maturation may occur via a population-switch mechanism whereby posttranslational modifications select for preexisting structures on the FES.

This study analyzed the distribution of the aerobic 9,10-seco steroid degradation pathway in 346 publically available metagenomes from diverse environments. Our results show that steroid-degrading bacteria are globally distributed and prevalent in particular environments, such as wastewater treatment plants, soil, plant rhizospheres, and the marine environment, including marine sponges. Genomic signature-based sequence binning recovered 45 metagenome-assembled genomes containing a majority of 9,10-seco pathway genes. Only Actinobacteria and Pro-teobacteria were identified as steroid degraders, but we identified several alpha- and gammaproteobacterial lineages not previously known to degrade steroids. Actino- and proteobacterial steroid degraders coexisted in wastewater, while soil and rhizosphere samples contained mostly actinobacterial ones. Actinobacterial steroid degraders were found in deep ocean samples, while mostly alpha- and gammaproteobacterial ones were found in other marine samples, including sponges. Isolation of steroid-degrading bacteria from sponges confirmed their presence. Phylogenetic analysis of key steroid degradation proteins suggested their biochemical novelty in genomes from sponges and other environments. This study shows that the ecological significance as well as taxonomic and biochemical diversity of bacterial steroid degradation has so far been largely underestimated, especially in the marine environment. IMPORTANCE Microbial steroid degradation is a critical process for biomass decomposition in natural environments, for removal of important pollutants during wastewater treatment, and for pathogenesis of bacteria associated with tuberculosis and other bacteria. To date, microbial steroid degradation was mainly studied in a few model organisms, while the ecological significance of steroid degradation remained largely unexplored. This study provides the first analysis of aerobic steroid degradation in diverse natural, engineered, and host-associated environments via bioinformatic analysis of an extensive metagenome data set. We found that steroid-degrading bacteria are globally distributed and prevalent in wastewater treatment plants, soil, plant rhizospheres, and the marine environment, especially in marine sponges. We show that the ecological significance as well as the taxonomic and biochemical diversity of bacterial steroid degradation has been largely underestimated. This study greatly expands our ecological and evolutionary understanding of microbial steroid degradation. © 2018 Holert et al.",Cholesterol; Comamonas; Metagenomics; Mycobacterium; Pseudomonas; Rhodococcus; Sponges; Steroid degradation,secosteroid; steroid; Actinobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; bacterial metabolism; biodegradation; catabolism; engineering; Gammaproteobacteria; host; marine environment; metagenome; microbial diversity; nonhuman; phylogeny; plant; priority journal; rhizosphere; sea; soil; species distribution; sponge (Porifera); waste water management; aerobic metabolism; environmental microbiology; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; metagenomics; phylogeography; Proteobacteria; Actinobacteria; Aerobiosis; Environmental Microbiology; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metabolism; Metagenomics; Phylogeography; Proteobacteria; Steroids,,American Society for Microbiology,21612129,,,29382738,English,mBio,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043503259,

The hospitality sector has increasingly gone smoke-free over the last decade. This study identified the availability and cost of smoking-permitted accommodations identified on Airbnb. Methods The study team searched for Airbnb accommodations in 12 Canadian cities across each of Canadas 10 provinces. Searches included availability for a single person for a private room, or double occupancy for an entire home/apartment; searches were for 1-night and 1-week stays. results Cities across Canada, including Regina, Fredericton and Charlottetown, had no smoking-permitted accommodations available for the searches conducted. The proportion of private rooms available for one night that permitted smoking ranged from 2% in Calgary, 4% in Winnipeg and St. Johns, 10% in Halifax and Victoria, 18% in Toronto, 45% in Vancouver and 69% in Montréal. The average cost for a private room for one night in Vancouver was $128, while the cost for a private room that permits smoking was $62; however, in other markets prices were more similar. Discussion Across Canada, there is a wide range of smoking-permitted accommodations available through Airbnb. In some markets, smoking-permitted accommodation may be significantly less expensive than smoke-free options. As hotel chains increasingly go smoke-free, it is possible that the marketplace will respond with offerings to fulfil consumer demand. As policy makers consider how to regulate P2P services like Airbnb, public health considerations should be included. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

Methods to evaluate research impact on policy processes and outcomes are especially underdeveloped, and are needed to optimize the influence of research on policy for addressing complex issues such as chronic diseases. Contribution analysis (CA), a theory-based approach to evaluation, holds promise under these conditions of complexity. Yet applications of CA for this purpose are limited, and methods are needed to strengthen contribution claims and ensure CA is practical to implement. This article reports the experience of a public health research center in Canada that applied CA to evaluate the impacts of its research on policy changes. The main goal was to experiment with methods that were relevant to CA objectives, sufficiently rigorous for making credible claims, and feasible. Methods were 'good enough' if they achieved all three attributes. Three cases on government policy in tobacco control were examined: creation of smoke-free multiunit dwellings, creation of smoke-free outdoor spaces, and regulation of flavored tobacco products. Getting to 'good enough' required careful selection of nested theories of change; strategic use of social science theories, as well as quantitative and qualitative data from diverse sources; and complementary methods to assemble and analyze evidence for testing the nested theories of change. Some methods reinforced existing good practice standards for CA, and others were adaptations or extensions of them. Our experience may inform efforts to influence policy with research, evaluate research impacts on policy using CA, and apply CA more broadly. © The Author 2017.",contribution analysis; research impact evaluation; strengthening quality; tobacco control policy,,,Oxford University Press,9582029,,,,English,Res.

However, methods to secure stored information on mobile devices may adversely affect usability. We tested the reliability and usability of common user authentication techniques in younger and older adults. Methodology Usability testing was conducted in two age groups, 18 to 30 years and 50 years and older. After completing a demographic questionnaire, each participant tested four authentication options in random order: four-digit personal identification number (PIN), graphical password (GRAPHICAL), Android pattern-lock (PATTERN), and a swipe-style Android fingerprint scanner (FINGERPRINT). Participants rated each option using the Systems Usability Scale (SUS). Results A total of 59 older and 43 younger participants completed the study. Overall, PATTERN was the fastest option (3.44s), and PIN had the fewest errors per attempt (0.02). Participants were able to login using PIN, PATTERN, and GRAPHICAL at least 98% of the time. FINGERPRINT was the slowest (26.97s), had an average of 1.46 errors per attempt, and had a successful login rate of 85%. Overall, PIN and PATTERN had higher SUS scores than FINGERPRINT and GRAPHICAL. Compared to younger participants, older participants were also less likely to find PATTERN to be tiring, annoying or time consuming and less likely to consider PIN to be time consuming. Younger participants were more likely to rate GRAPHICAL as annoying, time consuming and tiring than older participants. Conclusions On mobile devices, PIN and pattern-lock outperformed graphical passwords and swipe-style fingerprints. All participants took longer to authenticate using the swipe-style fingerprint compared to other options. Older participants also took two to three seconds longer to authenticate using the PIN, pattern and graphical passwords though this did not appear to affect perceived usability. © 2018 Grindrod et al.

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of engaging in unique clusters of unhealthy behaviours on youths body mass index (BMI) trajectories. Methods This study used a linked-longitudinal sample of Grades 9 and 10 students (13 to 17 years of age) participating in the COMPASS host study. Students reported obesity-related and other risky behaviours at baseline and height and weight (to derive BMI) at baseline (2012/2013) and annually for 2 years post-baseline (2013/14 and 2014/15). Students were grouped into behavioural clusters based on response probabilities. Linear mixed effects models, using BMI as a continuous outcome measure, were used to examine the effect of engaging in clusters of risky behaviours on BMI trajectories. Results There were significant differences in BMI of the four behavioural clusters at baseline that remained consistent over time. Higher BMI values were found among youth classified at baseline to be Typical High School Athletes (? = 0.232 kg/m2, [confidence interval (CI): 0.030.50]), Inactive High Screen-User (? = 0.348 kg/m2, CI: 0.110.59) and Moderately Active Substance Users (? = 0.759 kg/m2, CI: 0.361.15) compared to students classified as Health Conscious. Despite these baseline differences, BMI appeared to increase across all behavioural clusters annually by the same amount (? = 0.6097 kg/m2, (CI) = 0.570.64). Conclusions Although annual increases in BMI did not differ by behavioural clusters, membership in a particular behavioural cluster was associated with baseline BMI, and these differences remained consistent over time. Results indicate that intervening and modifying unhealthy behaviours earlier might have a greater impact than during adolescence. Health promotion strategies targeting the highest risk youth as they enter secondary school might be promising means to prevent or delay the onset of obesity. © 2018 Laxer et al.

Long-lived states exhibit relaxation times that are considerably longer than the spinlattice relaxation time, T1. The analysis is complementary to previous studies and provides insight into the relaxation mechanism of long-lived states by focusing exclusively on the symmetry of the spin Hamiltonian. Our study shows that the dipoledipole coupling between protons of a methyl group and between the protons and an external spin are both symmetry breaking interactions that can lead to relaxation pathways that transform the polarization from symmetry order to Zeeman order. The net contribution of the internal dipolar interaction to the NMR observation of long-lived states is zero. Our calculation is in good agreement with the reported features of the observed spectra and previous theoretical studies. © 2017, The Author(s).",Long-lived states; Relaxation; Symmetry,Crystal symmetry; Hamiltonians; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Dipolar interaction; Dipolar relaxation mechanisms; Lattice relaxation; Long-lived state; Relaxation; Relaxation mechanism; Symmetry properties; Theoretical study; Relaxation time,,Springer New York LLC,15700755,,,,English,Quantum Inf.

We categorize existing research into two main parts depending on the roles of big data. The first part focuses on energy-efficient wireless networking techniques in dealing with big data and covers studies in big data acquisition, communication, storage, and computation; while the second part investigates recent approaches based on big data analytics that are promising to enhance energy efficiency of wireless networks.

An eavesdropper (Eve) can eavesdrop on some information of the identity strings of the receiver and the controller without being detected by the selective-CNOT-operation (SCNO) attack. By the same attack, Eve can also steal some information of the secret message that the sender transmits. In addition, the receiver can take the same kind of attack to eavesdrop on some information of the secret message out of the control of the controller.

While novel genomic technologies have helped to increase knowledge of many aspects of immunology, most developments in immunology have occurred because of the availability of antibodies to identify and sort different cell types, as well as to identify and quantify the protein products of cells. Unfortunately, many studies performed in fish make use of poorly characterized antibody reagents that may affect the conclusions of those studies. In light of this, we would like to offer some insight and discussion points based on our research experience on the strategies and techniques that are required for proper validation of antibody reagents to fish immune molecules.

It is known that measurement error and misclassification may seriously degrade the quality of estimation and inference, and should be avoided whenever possible. However, in practice, it is inevitable that measurements contain error for a variety of reasons. It is thus necessary to develop statistical strategies to cope with this issue. Although many inference methods have been proposed in the literature to address mis-measurement effects, some important issues remain unexplored. Typically, it is generally unclear how the available methods may perform relative to each other. In this paper, capitalizing on the unique feature of discrete variables, we consider settings with misclassified binary covariates and investigate issues concerning covariate misclassification; our development parallels available strategies for handling measurement error in continuous covariates. Under a unified framework, we examine a number of valid inferential procedures for practical settings where a validation study, either internal or external, is available besides a main study. Furthermore, we compare the relative performance of these methods and make practical recommendations. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",efficiency; estimating function; external validation study; internal validation study; likelihood method; measurement error; misclassification,article; measurement error; regression analysis; validation study,,De Gruyter,15574679,,,,English,Int.

Since Grover's search algorithm cannot be implemented on a real quantum computer at present, its quantum simulation is regarded as an effective method to study the search performance. When simulating the Grover's algorithm, the storage space required is exponential, which makes it difficult to simulate the high-qubit Grovers algorithm. To this end, we deeply study the storage problem of probability amplitude, which is the core of the Grover simulation algorithm. We propose a novel memory-efficient method via amplitudes compression, and validate the effectiveness of the method by theoretical analysis and simulation experimentation. The results demonstrate that our compressed simulation search algorithm can help to save nearly 87.5% of the storage space than the uncompressed one. Thus under the same hardware conditions, our method can dramatically reduce the required computing nodes, and at the same time, it can simulate at least 3 qubits more than the uncompressed one. Particularly, our memory-efficient simulation method can also be used to simulate other quantum algorithms to effectively reduce the storage costs required in simulation.

Despite this evidence, age-related deficits in recognition memory are not consistently observed. This may be partially due to the fact that older animals also have well-established deficits in hippocampal function, and many protocols that assess perirhinal function are also sensitive to hippocampal damage. When using one of these protocols, spontaneous object recognition in an open field, we are able to replicate published age-related deficits using pairs of complex objects. However, when using zero-delay object recognition, a task that is more resistant to the influence of changes in hippocampal function, we find no significant age-related differences in recognition memory in the same animals. These data highlight the importance of the protocol used for testing recognition memory, and may place constraints on the role of the PRh in age-related recognition memory impairment as it is typically tested in much of the literature. © 2017 Marrone DF et al.",Aging; Hippocampus; Perirhinal cortex; Recognition memory,,,International Society on Aging and Disease,21525250,,,,English,Aging Dis.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054801346,

Methods: A total of 21 fresh, frozen tissues from patients diagnosed with clear cell carcinoma, endometrioid carcinoma, endometriosis and benign endometrium were subjected to an in-depth liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis on the Q-Exactive Plus. Protein identification and quantification were performed using MaxQuant, while downstream analyses were performed using Perseus and various bioinformatics databases. Results: Approximately 9000 proteins were identified in total, representing the first in-depth proteomic investigation of endometriosis and its associated cancers. This proteomic data was shown to be biologically sound, with minimal variation within patient cohorts and recapitulation of known markers. While moderate concordance with genomic data was observed, it was shown that such data are limited in their abilities to represent tumours on the protein level and to distinguish tumours from their benign precursors. Conclusions: The proteomic data suggests that distinct markers may differentiate endometrioid and clear cell carcinoma from endometriosis. These markers may be indicators of pathobiology but will need to be further investigated. Ultimately, this dataset may serve as a basis to unravel the underlying biology of the endometrioid and clear cell cancers with respect to their endometriotic origins. © 2018 Leung F et al.",Bioinformatics; Clear cell carcinoma; Endometrioid carcinoma; Endometriosis; Ovarian cancer; Proteomics,tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; cancer diagnosis; clear cell carcinoma; clinical article; cohort analysis; disease association; endometrioid carcinoma; endometriosis; female; genomics; human; human tissue; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; mass spectrometry; ovary carcinoma; protein analysis; proteomics,,F1000 Research Ltd,20461402,,,,English,F1000 Res.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045887331,

Recently, a variety of approaches have been proposed to extend synthesis of reactive systems from propositional specifications towards specifications over rich theories. We propose a novel, completely automated approach to program synthesis which reduces the problem to deciding the validity of a set of ? ? -formulas. In spirit of IC3/PDR, our problem space is recursively refined by blocking out regions of unsafe states, aiming to discover a fixpoint that describes safe reactions. If such a fixpoint is found, we construct a witness that is directly translated into an implementation. We implemented the algorithm on top of the JKind model checker, and exercised it against contracts written using the Lustre specification language. Experimental results show how the new algorithm outperforms JKinds already existing synthesis procedure based on k-induction and addresses soundness issues in the k-inductive approach with respect to unrealizable results. © The Author(s) 2018.",,Specification languages; Specifications; Automated approach; Automated synthesis; Fixpoints; Model checker; Problem space; Program synthesis; Reactive system; Synthesis procedure; Model checking,Beyer D.Huisman M.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

This study focuses on the flexural and shear behavior of the innovative sandwich panels, which is composed of two 3-D high density polyethylene (HDPE) skins, and high-density Polyurethane (PU) foam core. An experimental study was carried out to validate the effectiveness of this panel for increasing the ultimate bending strength. A series of experimental tests were performed on medium-scale specimens to characterize their core shear behavior. Then, some supplementary tests were run to determine the panels flexural and shear stiffness. The numerical and experimental investigations show that the 3-D-HDPE sheets, manufactured with a studded surface; considerably enhance the pull-out and delamination strength. Good agreement has been observed between the numerical and experimental tests. © 2018 Growing Science Ltd.

This has applications toward gaining better and more rigorous error bars for tasks such as parameter estimation (e.g. magnetometry), tomography, and randomized benchmarking. We start by providing a summary of the standard phenomenological model of the NV optical process in terms of Lindblad jump operators. This model is used to derive random variables describing emitted photons during measurement, to which finite visibility, dark counts, and imperfect state preparation are added. NV spin-state measurement is then stated as an abstract statistical inference problem consisting of an underlying biased coin obstructed by three Poisson rates. Relevant frequentist and Bayesian estimators are provided, discussed, and quantitatively compared. We show numerically that the risk of the maximum likelihood estimator is well approximated by the Cramér-Rao bound, for which we provide a simple formula. Of the estimators, we in particular promote the Bayes estimator, owing to its slightly better risk performance, and straightforward error propagation into more complex experiments. This is illustrated on experimental data, where quantum Hamiltonian learning is performed and cross-validated in a fully Bayesian setting, and compared to a more traditional weighted least squares fit. © 2018 The Author(s).

Substantively, to examine the prevalence of multimorbidity, identify sociodemographic correlates and model the influence of multimorbidity on changes in child quality of life and parental psychosocial outcomes over a 6-month follow-up. Design Prospective pilot study. Setting Two children's tertiary-care hospitals. Participants Children aged 6-16 years diagnosed in the past 6 months with one of the following: asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, food allergy or juvenile arthritis, and their parents. Outcome measures Response, participation and retention rates. Child mental disorder using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview at baseline and 6 months. Child quality of life, parental symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression, and family functioning. All outcomes were parent reported. Results Response, participation and retention rates were 90%, 83% and 88%, respectively. Of the 50 children enrolled in the study, the prevalence of multimorbidity was 58% at baseline and 42% at 6 months. No sociodemographic characteristics were associated with multimorbidity. Multimorbidity at baseline was associated with declines over 6 months in the following quality of life domains: physical well-being, ?='4.82 (-8.47, -1.17); psychological well-being, ?='4.10 (-7.62, -0.58) and school environment, ?='4.17 (-8.18, -0.16). There was no association with parental psychosocial outcomes over time. Conclusions Preliminary evidence suggests that mental disorder in children with a physical condition is very common and has a negative impact on quality of life over time. Based on the strong response rate and minimal attrition, our approach to study child multimorbidity appears feasible and suggests that multimorbidity is an important concern for families. Methodological and substantive findings from this pilot study have been used to implement a larger, more definitive study of child multimorbidity, which should lead to important clinical implications. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

This trend is facilitated by advancements in computational resources, improvements in simulation skill, and the desire to build numerical simulators that represent the water cycle with greater fidelity. In this quest to develop a state-of-the-art water cycle model, we coupled HydroGeoSphere (HGS), a 3-D control-volume finite element surface and variably saturated subsurface flow model that includes evapotranspiration processes, to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, a 3-D finite difference nonhydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric model. The two-way coupled model, referred to as HGS-WRF, exchanges the actual evapotranspiration fluxes and soil saturations calculated by HGS to WRF; conversely, the potential evapotranspiration and precipitation fluxes from WRF are passed to HGS. The flexible HGS-WRF coupling method allows for unique meshes used by each model, while maintaining mass and energy conservation between the domains. Furthermore, the HGS-WRF coupling implements a subtime stepping algorithm to minimize computational expense. As a demonstration of HGS-WRF's capabilities, we applied it to the California Basin and found a strong connection between the depth to the groundwater table and the latent heat fluxes across the land surface. © 2017.

Methods: Using available data for Ontario, the total number of vaccinations given by providers in the 2011/12 influenza season (pre) was compared to the 2013/14 influenza season (post). Vaccine costs and provider fees for administration were assigned for both periods. An economic model was created to estimate the impact of the change in influenza vaccination volume on influenza-related outcomes and on the health care costs associated with treating influenza-related outcomes. Productivity costs due to both time off work due to getting vaccinated and influenza illness were considered. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to assess parameter uncertainty. Results: The number of vaccinations received by Ontarians increased by 448,000 (3% of the population), with pharmacists vaccinating approximately 765,000 people/year. The increased cost to the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care was $6.3 million, while the money saved due to reduced influenza-related outcome costs was $763,158. Productivity losses were reduced by $4.5 million and $3.4 million for the time invested to get vaccinated and time off work due to influenza illness, respectively. Conclusion: After two influenza seasons, following the introduction of pharmacist-administered influenza vaccinations, there was a net immunization increase of almost 450,000, which potentially saved $2.3 million in direct health care costs and lost productivity in the province. © 2018 OReilly et al.",Costs; Immunization; Pharmacist; Productivity; Universal influenza vaccination,influenza vaccine; adolescent; adult; age; aged; Article; Canada; child; economic aspect; health care cost; human; influenza; influenza vaccination; outcome assessment; pharmacist; productivity; risk reduction; sensitivity analysis,,Dove Medical Press Ltd,11786981,,,,English,Clin.

This is a form of peer teaching/evaluation. This group dynamic favors creativity and inhibits obstacles to learning and understanding due to shyness, and other psychological factors. In addition, this paradigm allows the learner to be an active participant in the learning process rather than a passive recipient of knowledge as in the traditional lecture based teaching methodology. The project proposed here is based on both experimental and numerical approaches. Groups of students will be using simple and inexpensive equipment in a hands-on way. Additionally using numerical tools with open source environments such as the Python programming language allows one to perform numerical experiments. These two approaches are perfectly complementary; indeed the experiments favor observations and measurements and on the other hand numerical modeling favors abstraction and familiarization of mathematical formalisms of the optical phenomena. We propose a pedagogical methodology ""Active Learning in Simulating Optics"" (ALSO), where the active learning method is used not only for hands on experimentation while numerical modeling facilitates development of computer codes wherein students can design their own experiments. Mixing these two approaches, experimentation and simulation, is also very well adapted in working within projects for the elaboration of a new tools for teaching. This ALSO methodology will be presented along with results from workshops utilizing this technique. © 2018 SPIE.",Active learning; Numerical experiments; Open source Python; Optics simulations; Peer teaching; Physical optics.,Artificial intelligence; High level languages; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Open source software; Physical optics; Students; Teaching; Active Learning; Numerical experiments; Open sources; Optics simulations; Peer teaching; Learning systems,Gregory G.G.,SPIE,0277786X,9.78151E+12,PSISD,,English,Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056486884,

One of the emerging technologies that provide one's circadian and long-term physiological status with increased usability is unobtrusive zero-effort monitoring. In this paper, a zero-effort device, a floor tile, was used to develop an unobtrusive BP monitoring technique. Namely, RJ-interval, the time between the J-peak of a ballistocardiogram and the R-peak of an electrocardiogram, was used to develop a classifier that can detect changes in systolic BP (SBP) induced by the Valsalva maneuver on healthy adults (i.e., a simulated SH-OH). A t-test was used to show statistical differences between the mean RJ-intervals of decreased SBP, baseline, and increased SBP. Following the t-test, a classifier that detected a change in SBP was developed based on a naïve Bayes classifier (NBC). The t-test showed a clear statistical difference between the mean RJ-intervals of the increased SBP, baseline, and decreased SBP. The NBC-based classifier was able to detect increased SBP with 89.3% true positive rate (TPR), 100% true negative rate (TNR), and 94% accuracy and detect decreased SBP with 92.3% TPR, 100% TNR, and 95% accuracy. The analysis showed strong potential in using the developed classifier to assist monitoring of people with SH-OH; the algorithm may be used clinically to detect a long-term trend of symptoms of SH-OH. © 2013 IEEE.",ballistocardiogram; electrocardiogram; Orthostatic hypotension; RJ-interval; supine hypertension; systolic blood pressure,Blood pressure; Electrocardiography; Floors; Heart; Monitoring; ballistocardiogram; Biomedical monitoring; Hypertension; orthostatic hypotension; RJ-interval; supine hypertension; Systolic blood pressure; Sodium compounds,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21682372,,,,English,IEEE J.

An online cross-sectional experiment was conducted with Brazilian women aged 1626 (N = 640: 182 smokers and 458 nonsmokers) who rated 10 cigarette packages from one of three conditions: 1) branded packs; 2) packs with the same size, shape, and verbal descriptions as in condition 1, but without brand imagery (i.e., plain pack); and 3) packs from condition 2 but without brand descriptors (i.e., plain pack, no descriptors). Mixed-effects linear regression models were utilized to determine what associations that pack features (i.e., experimental condition; flavor descriptor vs. not; slim pack vs. not) had with participant ratings of nine characteristics, including appeal, taste, smoothness, and attributes of people who smoke the brand. Results. Flavored branded packs were rated as more appealing, better tasting, and smoother than flavored plain packs with descriptors. Compared to flavored plain packs with descriptors, the same packs without descriptors were rated less positively on eight of the nine characteristics. Compared to nonsusceptible nonsmokers, susceptible nonsmokers rated flavored packs more positively on eight of the nine characteristics. Slim packs were rated more positively than regular packs on eight of the nine characteristics. Conclusions. Slim packs and brands highlighting tobacco flavors appear to increase positive perceptions of tobacco products. Banning tobacco flavorings and slim packs may reduce the appeal of smoking for young Brazilian women, as well as for other vulnerable populations. © 2018 Pan American Health Organization.

To determine the prevalence and determinants of blood haemoglobin level and mild, moderate, and severe anemia in a sample of adults from rural Tamil Nadu, India. Subjects/Methods. We recruited a sample of men and nonpregnant women aged 20 years and older. Clinical health measures included blood haemoglobin concentration and body mass index. We assessed associations between anemia outcomes and sociodemographic and dietary factors using linear and logistic regression modeling. Results. A total of 753 individuals (412 women and 341 men) participated in this study. The prevalence of anemia was 57.2% among women and 39.3% among men (P<0.001). Prevalence of anemia increased with age among men (P<0.001) but not women (P>0.05). Iron intake was low; 11.7% women and 24.1% of men reported iron intakes above recommended dietary allowances (P<0.001). Factors (OR (95% CI)) associated with mild or moderate anemia among women included television ownership (0.27 (0.13, 0.58)), livestock ownership (0.46 (0.28, 0.75)), refined grain consumption (1.32 (1.02, 1.72)), meat consumption (0.84 (0.71, 0.99)), and commercial agriculture production (mild: 4.6 (1.1, 18.8); moderate: 6.8 (1.98, 23.1)). Factors associated with mild, moderate, or severe anemia among men included rurality (0.50 (0.25, 0.99)), sugar consumption (1.04 (1.01, 1.06)), egg consumption (0.80 (0.65, 0.99)), and high caste (7.3 (1.02, 52.3)). Conclusion. Both women and men in this region may be particularly vulnerable to anemia, and future research must expand beyond dietary risk factors to examine the impacts of sociodemographic and environmental factors. © 2018 Matthew Little et al.",,,,Hindawi Limited,20901267,,,,English,Anemia,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051036040,

Traditional geochemical and isotopic analyses (?18O, ?2H, 3H, ?34S/?18O (SO4), and 87Sr/86Sr) along with novel isotopic tools, such as ?37Cl and ?81Br, were used to provide new insights into lake geochemical processes along a transect of lakes from the coast to the ice margin in the Kangerlussuaq region. Evaporation was found to be a key process impacting lake chemistry and isotopic signatures in the ice marginal area, with decreasing importance toward the coast. Evaporative processes were apparent in the ?37Cl and ?81Br isotopic signatures of lake-water chemistry. Consistent with previous work elsewhere (e.g., Blum and Erel, 1995) on increased biotite weathering in glaciated environments, 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios were found to be more radiogenic (&gt;0.73) in lakes found in more recently glaciated terrain. Sulfide oxidation was the main source of sulfur (as sulfate) in lakes in the ice marginal area, while the influence of marine aerosols and bacterial sulfate reduction increased further away from the ice sheet around the fjord Kangerlussuaq. Groundwater discharge significant enough to impact lake chemistry was not observed in any of the lakes studied, suggesting that little groundwatersurface water interaction occurs in the study area or that recharge conditions are present in the majority of the lakes studied. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Wind towers can naturally ventilate buildings and also can create enhanced thermal comfort for occupants during the warm months. This study proposes a modern wind tower design with a moistened pad. The new design includes a fixed column, a rotating and movable head, an air opening with a screen, and two windows at the end of the column. The wind tower can be installed on roof-tops to take advantage of ambient airflow. The wind tower's head can be controlled manually or automatically to capture optimum wind velocity based on desired thermal condition. To maximize its performance, a small pump was considered to circulate and spray water on an evaporative cooling pad. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of airflow around and inside the proposed wind tower is conducted to analyze the ventilation performance of this new design of wind tower. Thereby, the velocity, total pressure, and pressure coefficient distributions around and within the wind tower for different wind velocities are examined. The simulation results illustrate that the new wind tower design with a moistened pad can be a reasonable solution to improve naturally the thermal comfort of buildings in hot and dry climates. © 2018 by the authors.

Measures of interest are defined over schedulers that resolve the nondeterminism. In this paper we investigate the power of various theoretically and practically motivated classes of schedulers, considering the classic complete-information view and a restriction to non-prophetic schedulers. We prove a hierarchy of scheduler classes w.r.t. unbounded probabilistic reachability. We find that, unlike Markovian formalisms, stochastic automata distinguish most classes even in this basic setting. Verification and strategy synthesis methods thus face a tradeoff between powerful and efficient classes. Using lightweight scheduler sampling, we explore this tradeoff and demonstrate the concept of a useful approximative verification technique for stochastic automata. © The Author(s) 2018.",,Automata theory; Scheduling; Stochastic models; Time sharing systems; Complete information; Compositional modeling; Non-determinism; Nondeterministic choice; Stochastic Automata; Strategy synthesis; Timed systems; Verification techniques; Stochastic systems,Baier C.Dal Lago U.,Springer Verlag,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

Methods: Our review was informed by compiling relevant literature identified through searching multiple health research databases (PubMed, Embase, and CIHNAHL) and grey literature sources (websites, blogs, and reports). We demonstrate how pharmacoepidemiologists, in particular, may use altmetrics to understand scholarly impact and knowledge translation by providing a case study of a drug-safety study conducted by the Canadian Network of Observational Drug Effect Studies. Results: A common approach to measuring research impact is the use of citation-based metrics, such as an article's citation count or a journal's impact factor. ""Alternative"" metrics, or altmetrics, are increasingly supported as a complementary measure of research uptake in the age of social media. Altmetrics are nontraditional indicators that capture a diverse set of traceable, online research-related artifacts including peer-reviewed publications and other research outputs (software, datasets, blogs, videos, posters, policy documents, presentations, social media posts, wiki entries, etc). Conclusion: Compared with traditional citation-based metrics, altmetrics take a more holistic view of research impact, attempting to capture the activity and engagement of both scholarly and nonscholarly communities. Despite the limited theoretical underpinnings, possible commercial influence, potential for gaming and manipulation, and numerous data quality-related issues, altmetrics are promising as a supplement to more traditional citation-based metrics because they can ingest and process a larger set of data points related to the flow and reach of scholarly communication from an expanded pool of stakeholders. Unlike citation-based metrics, altmetrics are not inherently rooted in the research publication process, which includes peer review; it is unclear to what extent they should be used for research evaluation. © 2018 The Authors.

Extensive quantum chemical calculations at B3LYP, B3LYP-D3 and MP2 levels of theory have been performed using the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set to determine the geometry, relative energy and vibrational properties of likely isomers and interpret the measured spectra. A diagnostic carbonyl stretching band at ?1720 cm-1 from the intact carboxylic group characterizes the IRMPD spectra of both [Tyr + X]- and [nitroTyr + X]-, revealing that the canonical isomers (maintaining intact amino and carboxylic functions) are the prevalent structures. The spectroscopic evidence reveals the presence of multiple non-covalent forms. The halide complexes of tyrosine conform to a mixture of plane and phenol isomers. The contribution of phenol-bound isomers is sensitive to anion size, increasing from chloride to iodide, consistent with the decreasing basicity of the halide, with relative amounts depending on the relative energies of the respective structures. The stability of the most favorable phenol isomer with respect to the reference plane geometry is in fact 1.3, -2.1, -6.8 kJ mol-1, for X = Cl, Br, I, respectively. The change in ?-acidity by ring nitration also stabilizes anion-? interactions yielding ring isomers for [nitroTyr + X]-, where the anion is placed above the face of the aromatic ring. © 2018 the Owner Societies.",,,,Royal Society of Chemistry,14639076,,PPCPF,,English,Phys.

This manuscript describes the development and pretest of the app. Methods: We used Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) to build the TTO app. The app's modular structure and REDCap's object-oriented environment facilitated development. After the TTO app was built, we recruited a purposive sample of 11 members of the general public to pretest its functionality and ease of use. Results: Feedback from the pretest group was positive. Minor modifications included clarity enhancements, such as rearranging some paragraph text into bullet points, labeling the app to delineate different question sections, and revising or deleting text. We also added a research question to enable the identification of respondents who know someone with Alzheimer's disease. Conclusions: We developed an online app to administer the TTO task. Other researchers may access and customize the app for their own research purposes.",Computer-Assisted personal interview; Health-related quality-of-life; REDCap; Time trade-off,,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,14388871,,,,English,J.

There have been attempts at culturally adapting evidence-based interventions for mental health problems, and a few meta-analyses have been published in this area. This is, however, a much debated subject. Furthermore, there is a lack of a comprehensive review of meta-analyses and literature reviews that provide guidance to policy makers and clinicians. This review summarizes the current meta-analysis literature on culturally adapted interventions for mental health disorders to provide a succinct account of the current state of knowledge in this area, limitations, and guidance for the future research. © 2018 Rathod et al.",Cultural adaptation; Interventions; Mental illness; Meta-analysis; Minority ethnic; Psychotherapies,adaptation; adolescent; adult; aged; clinical effectiveness; cultural factor; evidence based medicine; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mental health care; meta analysis (topic); psychotherapy; Review; systematic review,,Dove Medical Press Ltd.,11766328,,,,English,Neuropsychiatr.

We compute the dual stress-energy tensor for the spacetime and identify the energy density associated with a static observer at infinity. The dual energy-momentum tensor can be written as a three-dimensional perfect fluid plus a nonhydrodynamic contribution with a universal coefficient which is given in gauge theory variables. We demonstrate that both the holographic computation and the method of conformal completion yield the same result for the mass. We compare to previous work on black funnels and droplets, showing that the boundary region can be endowed with noncompact geometry, and comment on this novel holographic dual geometry. © 2018 authors.

Taking an intersectionality lens, multiple individual- and district-level factors are used to identify segments of any antenatal care usage in Uttar Pradesh Objective: This paper seeks to understand the multilevel contexts of ANC utilization. The planning and programming challenge is that such knowledge of contextual specificity is rarely known upfront at the initial stages of planning or implementing an intervention. Exploratory data analysis might be needed to identify such contextual specificity. Methods: Tree-structured regression methods are used to identify segments and interactions between factors. The results from the tree-structured regression were complemented with multilevel models that controlled for the clustering of individuals within districts. Results: Heterogeneities in utilization of any ANC were observed. The multiple segments of ANC utilization that were developed went from a low utilization of 23.7% for respondents who were not literate and did not have home ownership to a high of 82.4% for respondents who were literate and at the highest level of wealth. Key variables that helped define the segments of ANC utilization include: womans literacy, ownership of home, wealth index, and district-level sex ratio. Based on the multilevel model of any ANC utilization, cross-level interactions also were obtained between sex ratio and ownership of home as well as between sex ratio and literacy. Increases in sex ratio increased the influence of ownership of home on any ANC, while increases in sex ratio reduced the impact of womans literacy on receiving any ANC. Conclusion: We argue that a focus on heterogeneous segments of utilization can help build knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie inequities in maternal health utilization. Such knowledge of heterogeneity needs to be incorporated in contextualizing interventions to meet a variety of recipients needs. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This work exploits cooperative vehicular relaying to extract the associated underlying multipath and Doppler diversity using precoding techniques. We evaluated the capacity and diversity gain for the presented approach to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency. The abundance of moving vehicles, operating in an ad hoc fashion, can eliminate the need to establish a dedicated relaying infrastructure. A relay selection scheme is deployed, taking advantage of the potentially large number of available relaying vehicles. Further, we derivate a closed-form mathematical expression for the channel-secrecy capacity, diversity order gain, and the intercept probability. We used the direct transmission scenario as a reference to assess our analysis. Our analytical and simulation results for the presented model showed that channel-secrecy capacity and performance-indicators improved significantly. © 2018 Esraa M.

Specifically, chemoautotrophic microbes deriving energy from the oxidation of hydrogen sulphide and methane form the basis of the food web. Results: Here, we report the isolation of the first methane-oxidizing bacterium from the Movile Cave ecosystem, Candidatus Methylomonas sp. LWB, a new species and representative of Movile Cave microbial mat samples. While previous research has suggested a prevalence of anoxic conditions in deeper lake water and sediment, using smallscale shotgun metagenome sequencing, we show that metabolic genes encoding enzymes for aerobic methylotrophy are prevalent in sediment metagenomes possibly indicating the presence of microoxic conditions. Moreover, this study also indicates that members within the family Gallionellaceae (Sideroxydans and Gallionella) were the dominant taxa within the sediment microbial community, thus suggesting a major role for microaerophilic iron-oxidising bacteria in nutrient cycling within the Movile Cave sediments. Conclusions: In this study, based on phylogenetic and metabolic gene surveys of metagenome sequences, the possibility of aerobic microbial processes (i.e., methylotrophy and iron oxidation) within the sediment is indicated. We also highlight significant gaps in our knowledge on biogeochemical cycles within the Movile Cave ecosystem, and the need to further investigate potential feedback mechanisms between microbial communities in both lake sediment and lake water. © The Author(s). 2018.",Extreme ecosystem; Methane; Methanotrophs; Methylotrophic bacteria; Movile cave; One-carbon metabolism,"methanol dehydrogenase; methane; Article; bioinformatics; colony formation; denitrification; Gallionellaceae; gene sequence; genome analysis; Methylomonas; methylotroph; nonhuman; nutrient cycling; prevalence; priority journal; aerobic metabolism; chemistry; classification; DNA sequence; genetics; genomics; isolation and purification; metagenomics; microbiology; phylogeny; procedures; Proteobacteria; Romania; sediment; Aerobiosis; Genomics; Geologic Sediments; Metagenomics; Methane; Phylogeny; Proteobacteria; Romania; Sequence Analysis, DNA",,BioMed Central Ltd.,20492618,,,29291746,English,Microbiome,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042867729,

Methods: Data came from 283 parent-youth dyads aged 9 to 18 years. Parents and youth completed the assessments separately on 2 different occasions 7 to 14 days apart. After converting the OCHS-EBS scale scores to binary disorder classifications, we compare test-retest reliability estimates and use structural equation modelling (SEM) to compare estimates of convergent validity for the same disorders assessed by each instrument. Results: Average test-retest reliabilities based on ? were 0.71 (MINI-KID) and 0.67 (OCHS-EBS). The average ? coefficients for 3 latent measures comprising the following indicatorsparent perceptions of youth mental health need and impairment, diagnosis of specific disorders based on health professional communications and youth taking prescribed medication, and youth classifications of disorder based on the MINI-KIDwere 0.67 (MINI-KID) and 0.69 (OCHS-EBS). Conclusion: The OCHS-EBS and MINI-KID achieve comparable levels of reliability and convergent validity for classifying child psychiatric disorder.

Methods: Scale items were selected by agreement among 19 child psychologists and psychiatrists rating the correspondence between item descriptions and DSM-5 symptoms. Psychometric evaluation of the item properties and parent/caregiver and youth scales came from a general population study of 10,802 children and youth aged 4 to 17 years in 6537 families. Test-retest reliability data were collected from a subsample of 280 children and their caregivers who independently completed the OCHS-EBS checklist on 2 occasions 7 to 14 days apart. Structural equation modelling was used to assess internal and external convergent and discriminant validitythe latter tested against the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID). Results: Confirmatory factor analyses exhibited adequate item fit to all scales. Except for conduct disorder and youth-assessed separation anxiety disorder, internal (Cronbachs ?) and test-retest reliability (Pearsons r) for scale scores were 0.70 or above. Except for youth-assessed conduct disorder, the OCHS-EBS met criteria for internal and convergent and discriminant validity. Compared with the MINI-KID, the OCHS-EBS met criteria for external convergent and discriminant validity. Conclusions: The OCHS-EBS provide reliable and valid dimensional measurement of 7 DSM-5 disorders assessed by caregivers and youth in the general population. Part II describes use of the OCHS-EBS as a categorical (present/absent) measure of disorder. © The Author(s) 2018.",child psychiatric disorder; measurement; reliability; structural equation modelling; symptom checklist; validity,,,SAGE Publications Inc.,7067437,,CJPSD,,English,Can.

Endogenous fatty acid status influences health and disease via multiple mechanisms at all stages of the life cycle. Despite widespread interest, attempts to summarize the results of multiple studies addressing similar fatty acid-related outcomes via meta-analyses and systematic reviews have been disappointing, largely because of heterogeneity in study design, sampling, and laboratory and data analyses. Our purpose is to recommend best practices for fatty acid clinical nutrition and medical studies. Key issues in study design include judicious choice of sampled endogenous pools for fatty acid analysis, considering relevant physiologic state, duration of intervention and/or observation, consideration of specific fatty acid dynamics to link intake and endogenous concentrations, and interpretation of results with respect to known fatty acid ranges. Key laboratory considerations include proper sample storage, use of sample preparation methods known to be fit-for-purpose via published validation studies, detailed reporting or methods to establish proper fatty acid identification, and quantitative analysis, including calibration of differential response, quality control procedures, and reporting of data on a minimal set of fatty acids to enable comprehensive interpretation. We present a checklist of recommendations for fatty acid best practices to facilitate design, review, and evaluation of studies with the intention of improving study reproducibility. © Author(s) 2018.",Experimental design; Fatty acid methyl esters; Gas chromatography; Meta-analysis; Placebo; Protocol; Response factors; Sample preparation; Systematic review,,,Oxford University Press,29165,,AJCNA,,English,Am.

This study aims to verify the environmental benefit of this process in comparison with a reference process that produces APGs from corn starch based glucose. A life cycle assessment methodology is used to compare both production routes. The results have shown that the new production route based on wheat straw generates lower environmental impacts compared to the reference process because of the use of wheat straw instead of corn starch based glucose and the energy recovery from the by-product lignin that meets most of the energy demand of the process. The LCA results also show that the production of fatty alcohol dominates the life cycle impact of APGs. Environmental impacts are sensitive to the source of the fatty alcohol (from palm kernel or coconut oil). © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.,,,,Royal Society of Chemistry,14639262,,GRCHF,,English,Green Chem.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046977310,

Current screening strategies miss a significant proportion of cases, leaving many undiagnosed. Elevated HCV prevalence in those born between 1945 and 1965 has prompted calls for birth-cohort screening in this group. However, Canada lacks population-level data to support this recommendation. We performed a serosurvey to obtain population-based HCV prevalence estimates in Ontario residents born between 19451974, to generate evidence for birth-cohort screening recommendations. Methods We tested anonymized residual sera in five-year age-sex bands from Ontario for anti-HCV antibody. We performed descriptive epidemiological analysis and used a logistic regression model to determine HCV risk-factors. Results Of 10,006 sera analyzed, 155 (1.55%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32, 1.81) were positive for HCV antibody. Individuals born between 19501964 had a significantly higher combined prevalence of 1.92% (95% CI 1.56, 2.34) compared to 1.14% (95% CI 0.69, 1.77) (p = 0.04) for those born between 19701974. For males, comprising 107/155 (69.03%) of positive samples, the highest prevalence was 3.00% (95% CI 1.95, 4.39) for the 19601964 birth-cohort. For females, the highest prevalence was 1.56% (95% CI 0.83, 2.65) for those born between 19551959. Male sex was significantly associated with positive HCV serostatus. Interpretation HCV prevalence in Ontario is highest among those in this birth cohort, and higher than previous estimates. The prevalence estimates presented in our study provide important data to underpin birth-cohort screening recommendations. © 2018 Bolotin et al.

Objective Guided by psychological theories emphasizing the role of emotions on risk concern and behavior change, we investigated whether smokers who reported stronger negative emotional responses when viewing warnings reported stronger responses to warnings in daily life and were more likely to try to quit at follow-up. Methods We analyzed data from 5439 adult smokers from Australia, Canada, Mexico, and the US, who were surveyed every four months from September 2012 to September 2014. Participants were shown warnings already implemented on packs in their country and reported negative emotional responses (i.e., fear, disgust, worry), which were averaged (range = 1 to 9). Country-stratified logistic and linear generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the effect of negative emotional responses on self-reported responses to warnings in daily life (i.e., attention, risk concern, avoidance of warnings, forgoing planned cigarettes) and quit attempts at follow-up. Models were adjusted for socio-demographic and smoking-related characteristics, survey wave, and the number of prior surveys answered. Results Smokers who reported stronger negative emotions were more likely to make quit attempts at follow-up (Adjusted ORs ranged from 1.09 [95% CI 1.04 to 1.14] to 1.17 [95% CI 1.12 to 1.23]; p <.001) than those who reported lower negative emotions. This relationship was mediated through attention to warnings and behavioral responses to warnings. There was no significant interaction of negative emotions with self-efficacy or nicotine dependence. Conclusion Negative emotions elicited by warnings encourage behavior change, promoting attention to warnings and behavioral responses that positively predict quit attempts. © 2017 The Authors",Fear appeals; Health communication; Product labeling; Smoking cessation; Tobacco products,health education; path analysis; psychology; smoking; tobacco; adult; Article; attention; attitude to health; Australia; avoidance behavior; behavior change; Canada; cognition; consumer attitude; daily life activity; dependent variable; disgust; fear; female; follow up; health survey; human; independent variable; longitudinal study; male; Mexico; middle aged; path analysis; patient worry; prediction; public health message; quality of life; risk assessment; self concept; self report; smoking; smoking cessation; tobacco dependence; United States; adolescent; emotion; packaging; psychology; smoking; smoking cessation; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Australia; Canada; Mexico [North America]; United States; Nicotiana tabacum; Adolescent; Adult; Australia; Canada; Emotions; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Product Labeling; Smokers; Smoking Cessation; United States; Young Adult,,Elsevier Ltd,2779536,,SSMDE,29096946,English,Soc.

However, the Report also noted that recent increases in vaping have been associated with declining rates of youth smoking. This paper examines the temporal relationship between vaping and youth smoking using multiple data sets to explore the question of whether vaping promotes smoking initiation in the USA. Methods: Using publicly available, nationally representative data on smoking and vaping among youth and young adults, we conducted a trend line analysis of deviations from long-term trends in smoking starting from when vaping became more prevalent. Results: There was a substantial increase in youth vaping prevalence beginning in about 2014. Time trend analyses showed that the decline in past 30-day smoking prevalence accelerated by two to four times after 2014. Indicators of more established smoking rates, including the proportion of daily smokers among past 30-day smokers, also decreased more rapidly as vaping became more prevalent. Conclusions: The inverse relationship between vaping and smoking was robust across different data sets for both youth and young adults and for current and more established smoking. While trying electronic cigarettes may causally increase smoking among some youth, the aggregate effect at the population level appears to be negligible given the reduction in smoking initiation during the period of vaping's ascendance. © 2018 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).",electronic nicotine delivery devices; harm reduction; surveillance and monitoring,,,BMJ Publishing Group,9644563,,,,English,Tob.

These newobservations were obtained with the optical imaging Fourier transform spectrometer SITELLE at CFHT. With its wide field of view (~11 arcmin×11 arcmin), SITELLE is the only integral field unit spectroscopy instrument able to cover the 80 kpc × 55 kpc ( 3.8 arcmin×2.6 arcmin) large nebula in NGC 1275. Our analysis of these observations shows a smooth radial gradient of the [NII]?6583/H ? line ratio, suggesting a change in the ionization mechanism and source across the nebula. The velocity map shows no visible general trend or rotation, indicating that filaments are not falling uniformly onto the galaxy, nor being uniformly pulled out from it. Comparison between the physical properties of the filaments and Hitomi measurements of the X-ray gas dynamics in Perseus is also explored. © 2018 The Author(s).",Galaxies: clusters: individual: Perseus cluster; Galaxies: Individual: NGC 1275,,,Oxford University Press,17453925,,,,English,Mon.

Design This multi-method study presents cross-sectional findings of the extent of compliance in the early phase of Uganda's comprehensive smoke-free law (2 months postimplementation; pre-enforcement). Setting Bars, pubs and restaurants in Kampala Uganda. Procedure and participants A two-stage stratified cluster sampling procedure was used to select hospitality sites stratified by all five divisions in Kampala. A total of 222 establishments were selected for the study. One hospitality representative from each of the visited sites agreed to take part in a face-to-face administered questionnaire. A subsample of hospitality venues were randomly selected for tobacco air quality testing (n=108). Data were collected between June and August 2016. Outcome measures Knowledge and opinions of the smoke-free law among hospitality venue staff and owners. The level of compliance with the smoke-free law in hospitality venues through: (1) systematic objective observations (eg, active smoking, the presence of designated smoking areas, 'no smoking' signage) and (2) air quality by measuring the levels of tobacco particulate matter (PM 2.5) in both indoor and outdoor venues. Results Active smoking was observed in 18% of venues, 31% had visible 'no smoking' signage and 47% had visible cigarette remains. Among interviewed respondents, 57% agreed that they had not been adequately informed about the smoke-free law; however, 90% were supportive of the ban. Nearly all respondents (97%) agreed that the law will protect workers' health, but 32% believed that the law would cause financial losses at their establishment. Indoor PM 2.5 levels were hazardous (267.6 ?g/m 3) in venues that allowed smoking and moderate (29.6 ?g/m 3) in smoke-free establishments. Conclusions In the early phase of Uganda's smoke-free law, the level of compliance in hospitality venues settings in Kampala was suboptimal. Civil society and the media have strong potential to inform and educate the hospitality industry and smokers of the benefits and requirements of the smoke-free law. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.",enforcement; policy; secondhand/environmental exposure; smoking; tobacco control,"adult; air quality; catering service; environmental exposure; female; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; particulate matter; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; sampling; smoking ban; staff; Uganda; worker; awareness; checklist; cross-sectional study; indoor air pollution; legislation and jurisprudence; passive smoking; prevention and control; protocol compliance; public health; smoking; sports and sport related phenomena; Uganda; Air Pollution, Indoor; Awareness; Checklist; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Male; Public Health; Restaurants; Smoke-Free Policy; Smoking; Sports and Recreational Facilities; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; Uganda",,BMJ Publishing Group,20446055,,,29306880,English,BMJ Open,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040548163,

This biodiversity challenge far outstrips the capacities of trained scientific experts. Here we explore whether crowdsourcing can be used to collect matrix data on a large scale with the participation of nonexpert students, or ""citizen scientists."" Crowdsourcing, or data collection by nonexperts, frequently via the internet, has enabled scientists to tackle some large-scale data collection challenges too massive for individuals or scientific teams alone. The quality of work by nonexpert crowds is, however, often questioned and little data have been collected on how such crowds performon complex tasks such as phylogenetic character coding.We studied a crowd of over 600 nonexperts and found that they could use images to identify anatomical similarity (hypotheses of homology) with an average accuracy of 82% compared with scores provided by experts in the field. This performance pattern held across the Tree of Life, from protists to vertebrates.We introduce a procedure that predicts the difficulty of each character and that can be used to assign harder characters to experts and easier characters to a nonexpert crowd for scoring.We test this procedure in a controlled experiment comparing crowd scores to those of experts and showthat crowds can produce matrices with over 90% of cells scored correctly while reducing the number of cells to be scored by experts by 50%. Preparation time, including image collection and processing, for a crowdsourcing experiment is significant, and does not currently save time of scientific experts overall. However, if innovations in automation or robotics can reduce such effort, then large-scale implementation of our method could greatly increase the collective scientific knowledge of species phenotypes for phylogenetic tree building. For the field of crowdsourcing,we provide a rare study with ground truth, or an experimental control that many studies lack, and contribute new methods on how to coordinate the work of experts and nonexperts. We show that there are important instances in which crowd consensus is not a good proxy for correctness.",Citizen science; crowdsourcing; MorphoBank; morphology; phenomics; phylogenetics,animal; classification; crowdsourcing; phenotype; phylogeny; procedures; professional competence; reproducibility; standards; Animals; Classification; Crowdsourcing; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Professional Competence; Reproducibility of Results,,Oxford University Press,10635157,,,29253296,English,Syst.
