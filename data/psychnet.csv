Chapter,"Atoms, categorization, and conceptual change.","This chapter uses the concept of an [ATOM] to discuss ways in which categorization depends on conceptual change. Features of such theoretical concepts are theory-generated rather than observed. They fit much better with the “knowledge approach” to the nature of concepts than to classical, exemplar, or prototype theories. The concept of atom has undergone numerous changes in the history of chemistry, most notably the realization that atoms are divisible and have internal structure.

Chapter,Neurosemantics and categories.,"I argue that a theory of category meaning that starts with the shared resources of all animals (i.e., neurons) can, if suitably constructed, provide solutions to traditional problems in semantics. I argue that traditional approaches that rely too heavily on linguistics or folk psychological categories are likely to lead us astray. In light of these methodological considerations, I turn to the more theoretical question of how to construct a semantic theory for categories informed by neuroscience. The second part of the paper is concerned with describing such a theory and discussing some of its consequences. I present a theory of neural representations that describes them as a kind of code, and show that such an understanding scales naturally to include complex representations such as concepts. I use this understanding of representational states to underwrite a theory of semantics. However, the theory must be supplemented by what I call the statistical dependence hypothesis. Content is then determined by a combination of the states picked out by this hypothesis and the neural decoders that define subsequent transformations of the neural representations. I briefly describe a solution to the traditional problem of misrepresentation that is consistent with this theory. Finally, I discuss recent successes in large-scale brain modeling that were driven by the theory, and suggest that this work provides direct support for the underlying semantic theory.

Chapter,"Pathological responsibility, thought-action fusion, and thought control in OCD.","Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by the persistent recurrence of unwanted thoughts. Indeed, perceived loss of control over thoughts is a key complaint of many OCD sufferers. The unwanted thoughts recur despite effortful proactive and reactive attempts to avoid or suppress them. Why they persist is a question that has been of considerable interest to researchers and clinicians; if we solve the problem of thought persistence we render the compulsions obsolete. Leading theories of OCD have identified three key factors in the persistence of obsessional thoughts: pathological responsibility, thought-action fusion, and thought suppression. This chapter presents a theoretical overview of each factor, case examples, a brief review of the empirical research, and clinical implications, followed by a commentary on current status and future directions.

Journal Article,Finding a home (somewhere) for medical aid in dying.,"Recent alterations to the criminal code following the passing of Bill C-14 have made Medical Aid in Dying (MAID) legal in Canada. With the new legislation in place, institutional questions arise concerning how MAID should be provided within the health care system. Alternatively, what are the limitations of conscientious objection to MAID? Palliative Care Units (PCUs) are in dire need of the answers to these questions, as they face contrary obligations towards patients requesting MAID. MAID seems to contradict some of the principle values of palliative care, while palliative care patients are also in a condition where they more likely to be eligible for MAID. Yet, examining some of these value contradictions more closely, there are more commonalities between MAID and palliative care than it would first seem. As a result, if PCUs conscientiously object to MAID as departments, then they are neglecting to fulfill their responsibility to honor their own missions and values. These commonalities in value between MAID and palliative care have clinical implications, as many of the patients who would prefer palliative care are also patients who would consider pursuing MAID concurrently. Three cases where patients could request both MAID and palliative care are outlined. They reveal a risk that a departmental conscientious objection to MAID in the PCU comes at the expense of patients receiving necessary palliative care.

Journal Article,In the thick of moral motivation.,"We accomplish three things in this paper. First, we provide evidence that the motivational internalism/externalism debate in moral psychology could be a false dichotomy born of ambiguity. Second, we provide further evidence for a crucial distinction between two different categories of belief in folk psychology: thick belief and thin belief. Third, we demonstrate how careful attention to deep features of folk psychology can help diagnose and defuse seemingly intractable philosophical disagreement in metaethics.

Journal Article,Narrating the sound of self: The role of pronunciation in learners’ self‐constructions in study‐abroad contexts.,"This paper discusses the findings of an empirical study that explores the relationship between study‐abroad experiences, learner identity, and pronunciation. We argue that the role of pronunciation as a personal domain of meaning‐making warrants more attention than it has hitherto received. To this end, we investigate the narratives of Canadian learners, studying abroad in Germany, in relation to discourses of language learning, culture, and identity, using a Critical Discourse Analysis approach. Our data, which we gained from semi‐structured interviews and e‐journals, shows that learners’ perceptions of pronunciation are closely linked to their views of the native‐speaker ideal, impacting their self‐constructions and interpretations of learning experience. In conclusion, we argue for a more differentiated understanding of pronunciation and its implications for language teaching and study abroad.

Journal Article,Family matters: An Arendtian critique of organizational structures.,"In this paper, we use Hannah Arendt's conception of praxis and her critique of family to diagnose how praxis and diversity initiatives may suffer when family is used as an organizing principle. As an organizing principle, notions of family function to promote hierarchical sameness within organizations, thereby suppressing diversity. In response to hierarchical sameness, Arendtian praxis can destabilize homogenizing tendencies, and effect social change by challenging ‘business as usual��. Further, because praxis is situated within a diverse, plural community of actors, it is able to appreciate diversity within organizations. Hence, we suggest that organizations can ‘do’ diversity better with a structure that enables praxis to emerge. In addition, we point to ways in which family as an organizational principle privileges a narrow conception of family that obscures gender, racial, sexual and class‐based inequities. This project contributes to the feminist scholarship on diversity and organizational inequities.

Journal Article,What happened to the society of leisure? Of the gap between the “haves” and “have nots” (Canadian time use and well-being trends).,"Canadian time use trends of the past 30 years are examined, using General Social Survey data collected by Statistics Canada in 1981, 1986, 1992, 1998, 2005, and 2010. The article analyses changes in the allocation of time to paid work, domestic work, personal needs, and free time, as well as accompanying changes in perceived time pressure and subjective well-being. The article addresses four questions: (1) Do objectively measured time use trends support optimistic forecasts of the 1960s that transition to post-industrial societies is accompanied by substantial gains of free time? (2) Did the time use changes of the past 30 years affect different population and lifecycle groups evenly or asymmetrically? (3) Is there an accord or discord between the objective measures of time use and subjective feelings of time pressure? (4) What are the emotional, and socio-political implications of the observed time use trends?

Journal Article,Knowledge attributions and behavioral predictions.,"Recent work has shown that knowledge attributions affect how people think others should behave, more so than belief attributions do. This paper reports two experiments providing evidence that (a) knowledge attributions also affect behavioral predictions more strongly than belief attributions do, and (b) knowledge attributions facilitate faster behavioral predictions than belief attributions do. Thus, knowledge attributions play multiple critical roles in social cognition, guiding judgments about how people should and will behave.

Journal Article,Is semantic activation from print capacity limited? Evidence from the psychological refractory period paradigm.,"A widely accepted belief across a range of subfields in psychology is that print activates semantics “automatically” in some sense. One such sense is that activating semantics does not require capacity. This view is assessed here in the context of the Psychological Refractory Period (PRP) paradigm because it provides a way of determining whether semantic activation requires a form of capacity. Task 1 was tone classification. Task 2 was Stroop color naming. The distractors consisted of color words on some trials (e.g., BLUE), and semantic associates on others (e.g., TOMATO). Both types of distractors yielded a pattern of data inconsistent with the widespread view that semantic activation is capacity free.

Journal Article,The distinctive “should” of assertability.,"Recent work has assumed that the normativity associated with assertion differs from the normativity of morality, practical rationality, etiquette, and legality. That is, whether an assertion “should” be made is not merely a function of these other familiar sorts of normativity and is especially connected to truth. Some researchers have challenged this assumption of distinctive normativity. In this paper I report two experiments that test the assumption. Participants read a brief story, judged whether an assertion should be made, and rated several other qualities of the assertion, including its truth value, morality, rationality, etiquette, legality, and folly. Of these qualities, truth value most strongly predicted assertability. The findings support the assumption of distinctive normativity and provide further evidence that the norm of our social practice of assertion is factive (i.e., it makes truth essential to assertability).

Comment/Reply,Radical cognitivism? Distinguishing behavior from thought.,"Comments on an article by Jan De Houwer et al. (see record 2017-15804-001). De Houwer et al. offer up what appears to be a simple recommendation for the field: that we should distinguish—and even separate—our descriptions of the phenomena that we investigate from our theoretical accounts of those phenomena. They characterize this as a distinction between functional explanation and cognitive explanation, respectively. And they maintain that more assiduous application of this distinction would be of value not only for basic research but also for applied research, the focus of this article. In this commentary, we consider several aspects of this proposal, including its emphasis on the stimulus-environment response level of description, the implications for the labeling of phenomena, the rationale for separating description from explanation, and the potential consequences for the application to basic research. On some of these, we find ourselves in agreement; on others, we respectfully disagree.

Journal Article,Joint influence of visual and auditory words in the Stroop task.,"We conducted four Stroop color–word experiments to examine how multiple stimuli influence interference. Experiments 1a and 1b showed that interference was strong when the word and color were integrated, and that visual and auditory words made independent contributions to interference when these words had different meanings. Experiments 2 and 3 confirmed this pattern when the word information and color information were not integrated, and hence when overall interference was substantially less. Auditory and visual interference effects are comparable except when the visual distracter is integrated with the color, in which case interference is substantially enhanced. Overall, these results are interpreted as being most consistent with a joint influence account of interference as opposed to a capture account.

In this Special Issue, contributing authors intentionally merge, or grapple with in parallel, the terrains of tourism moralities and tourism mobilities.

Journal Article,Digital-gaming trajectories and second language development.,"Recent research in digital game-based language learning has been encouraging, yet it would benefit from research methods that focus on the gaming processes and second language development (Larsen-Freeman, 2015) rather than learner/player reflection or individuals’ beliefs about the validity of gameplay. This has proven challenging as research methods which provide insight into the gameplay experiences and its many factors are needed. Having the gameplay experience occur extramurally is desirable, but makes the direct observation of the learners’ activities by a researcher difficult. For this reason, we suggest approaching digital game-based language learning through complex adaptive systems research (Larsen-Freeman & Cameron, 2008a) and employing Dörnyei’s (2014) retrodictive qualitative modeling to capture the complex synchronic and diachronic variability of the learners and their individual nonlinear gaming trajectories with requisite data density and over a considerable period of time.

Consideration is also given to the methodological challenges posed by using of terrorists' accounts of their motivations.

The philosophical debate about modesty has largely focused on the question of which kind of mental state—cognitive, motivational, or evaluative—best captures the virtue of modesty. We therefore conducted a series of experiments to see which philosophical account matches the folk concept of modesty. Surprisingly, we found that the folk concept is primarily behavioral. This leads us to argue that modesty may not be a virtue, but that if it is none of the extant philosophical accounts have properly explained why.

Journal,Exploring community cohesion in rural canada post-extreme weather: Planning ahead for unknown stresses.,"As social capital evolves, we need to better address how we assess it in terms of community connection and involvement. This research presents a longitudinal study of Goderich, Ontario’s post-tornado community connection and involvement in relation to the Capacities and Vulnerabilities Analysis (CVA) model’s social, physical, and motivational factors. We first address literature around rural communities, extreme stresses related to capacity and vulnerability, the window of opportunity, and current uses for the CVA model before continuing with a brief synopsis of the study community and our research methods of surveys and interviews. Our results highlight three key findings: (a) there was a reduction in perceptions of connection and satisfaction with rebuild from 2012 to 2016; (b) in 2016, employed individuals experience a stronger sense of connection to community; and (c) five years after the tornado, the more satisfaction with involvement the higher the sense of community connection. Concluding our discussion of these findings, we propose a modification to extend the CVA model’s usefulness to a wider range of situations. We argue a pre-emptive, motivationally focused CVA model can be a useful tool for rural communities in multi-level income locations to address their community’s capacities and vulnerabilities prior to an extreme stress and build their connection and involvement levels.

Journal Article,Introduction to thematic symposium on accounting professionalism.,"This article presents an introduction to the thematic symposium on accounting professionalism. The five papers and their discussant comments that follow are the product of the Symposium conducted by the Centre for Accounting Ethics, University of Waterloo, in Toronto, Canada, May 2015. The theme of both the Symposium and this collection of papers is accounting professionalism. The motivation for the Symposium was to increase insights and understanding of the key factors that shape accounting professionalism today. More specifically, the intent was to increase one's understanding of the factors that impact accounting professionalism and to explore how shifting notions of professionalism might impact the role of accounting in society and the delivery of accounting services. One underlying assumption shared by this collection of papers is that professionalism in accounting is evolving and responding to continual changes in the regulatory, social, and economic environment in which the profession operates. This collection of papers provides insight into professionalism as currently exercised by professional accountants in public practice and in industry.

Journal Article,The culture of permadeath: Roguelikes and terror management theory.,"In this exploratory article, Rob Parker examines the function of permadeath in the roguelike subgenre of computer role-playing games (cRPGs) through the lens of Terror Management Theory (TMT). In doing so, he provides a broad history of the subgenre, with specific attention to providing a productive distinction between modern and traditional roguelikes that lies in how they handle permadeath. He suggests that this focus on permadeath is one of the primary motivating factors for the resilience of the roguelike community over time, and what the implications of those motivations might mean for other members of the gaming community.

Journal Article,"En/activist drag: Kings reflect on queerness, queens, and questionable masculinities.","In recent years, media attention to drag performers has increased transforming the once-hidden leisure activity of gay men and lesbians into a publicly recognized phenomenon. Many of these representations of drag have fallen short in offering reflective illustrations of the connections among gender identity, performance, misogyny, patriarchy, and activism. In response,we find ourselves studying the gendered life experiences of drag kings to illuminate the variety of experiences that shape their gendered lives. We specifically look to our re-storied, visual, composite narratives of eight kings’ experiences to show how drag functions as a context where social-political-capitalist transformation can be enacted.

Journal Article,Women's leisure as political practice: A feminist analysis of Orange Is the New Black.,"The purpose of this article is to examine representations of women’s leisure portrayed on the popular Netflix television series Orange Is the New Black (OITNB). Using a feminist lens rooted in the notion of interconnectivity, we draw on four television tropes proposed by Pozner (2010) that are commonly used to depict women characters on television to analyze representations of women's leisure in the first three seasons of OITNB. Our analysis reveals the complex and messy ways representations of women’s leisure on OITNB can be used to discipline, reproduce, but also challenge power relations associated with common media tropes, acting as a form of political practice. We conclude by considering the implications of how these representations can influence the lives of women consuming this media content as part of their leisure.

Chapter,Fighting “the system”: The Turner Diaries.,"The Turner Diaries has become the “Bible” of right-wing White supremacists and a symbol of violence and home-grown terrorism to mainstream media and their audiences. The book, an underground hit since the 1970s, became an overnight symbol of terrorism, homegrown fear, and racist violence when media reports linked the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma to U.S. White supremacist who was obsessed with the book. Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma Bomber, and his accomplice Terry Nichols, brought The Turner Diaries into the spotlight. In fact, the book has not only had an impact on White supremacist groups in the United States, but it has also become an aspect of their religious mythology, created martyrs, and helped to mobilize and inspire self-envisioned heroes of the right to start what they hope will be their end time, apocalyptic revolution. Crimes have been re-enacted from the novel, groups have adopted names and step-by-step plans from the book, but McVeigh’s bombing of the government building was the most easily recognizable enactment from the book, and was also the most deadly/violent act instigated by William Pierce’s most famed fictional novel.

Chapter,Medical assistance in dying.,"Recent alterations to the criminal code following the passing of Bill C-14 have made Medical Aid in Dying (MAID) legal in Canada. With the new legislation in place, institutional questions arise concerning how MAID should be provided within the health care system. Alternatively, what are the limitations of conscientious objection to MAID? Palliative Care Units (PCUs) are in dire need of the answers to these questions, as they face contrary obligations towards patients requesting MAID. MAID seems to contradict some of the principle values of palliative care, while palliative care patients are also in a condition where they more likely to be eligible for MAID. Yet, examining some of these value contradictions more closely, there are more commonalities between MAID and palliative care than it might first seem. As a result, if PCUs conscientiously object to MAID as departments, then they are neglecting to fulfill their responsibility to honor their own missions and values. These commonalities in value between MAID and palliative care have clinical implications, as many of the patients who would prefer palliative care are also patients who would consider pursuing MAID concurrently. Three cases where patients could request both MAID and palliative care are outlined. They reveal a risk that a departmental conscientious objection to MAID in the PCU comes at the expense of patients receiving necessary palliative care.

Journal Article,Contextualizing language attitudes: An interactional perspective.,"Language attitudes research has had a history spanning several decades largely influenced by quantitative approaches. More recently, interactional perspectives have added new impetus to the field. This article provides an overview of interactional approaches to language attitudes, which are divided into three main groups: (a) discursive psychology, (b) approaches that draw on conversational analysis and interactional sociolinguistics, and (c) approaches based in the theory of motivated information management. The authors argue that these approaches can instigate new questions and yield new insights into our understanding of language attitudes. In positioning qualitative, largely interactional, approaches with respect to one another (and, briefly, to language attitude study more broadly), this article also re‐evaluates some terminological inconsistencies across the field and touches on areas that ought to be considered in future research addressing language attitudes.

Comment/Reply,The neurobiology of health communication.,"This issue of Psychosomatic Medicine describes findings from an innovative study by Kang et al that used neuroimaging methods to quantify neural responses to health communications. Findings indicated that sedentary individuals who hold self-transcendent values show attenuated limbic threat responses to communications about the benefits of physical activity. Furthermore, participants who were instructed to articulate such values showed some evidence of additional blunting of the same neural response. In this editorial, we provide context for the interpretation of these findings within the existing research using the brain-as-predictor approach, and other recent trends within biobehavioral medicine involving the use of neuroscience methods in the service of health behavior change.

Journal Article,Wisdom in context.,"Philosophers and psychological scientists have converged on the idea that wisdom involves certain aspects of thinking (e.g., intellectual humility, recognition of uncertainty and change), enabling application of knowledge to life challenges. Empirical evidence indicates that people’s ability to think wisely varies dramatically across experiential contexts that they encounter over the life span. Moreover, wise thinking varies from one situation to another, with self-focused contexts inhibiting wise thinking. Experiments can show ways to buffer thinking against bias in cases in which self-interests are unavoidable. Specifically, an ego-decentering cognitive mind-set enables wise thinking about personally meaningful issues. It appears that experiential, situational, and cultural factors are even more powerful in shaping wisdom than previously imagined. Focus on such contextual factors sheds new light on the processes underlying wise thought and its development, helps to integrate different approaches to studying wisdom, and has implications for measurement and development of wisdom-enhancing interventions.

Journal,Increasing participant motivation reduces rates of intentional and unintentional mind wandering.,"We explored the possibility that increasing participants’ motivation to perform well on a focal task can reduce mind wandering. Participants completed a sustained-attention task either with standard instructions (normal motivation), or with instructions informing them that they could be excused from the experiment early if they achieved a certain level of performance (higher motivation). Throughout the task, we assessed rates of mind wandering (both intentional and unintentional types) via thought probes. Results showed that the motivation manipulation led to significant reductions in both intentional and unintentional mind wandering as well as improvements in task performance. Most critically, we found that our simple motivation manipulation led to a dramatic reduction in probe-caught mind-wandering rates (49%) compared to a control condition (67%), which suggests the utility of motivation-based methods to reduce people’s propensity to mind-wander.

Journal Article,How locomotion concerns influence perceptual judgments.,"Successful self-regulation involves both assessment (e.g., making the right choices) and locomotion (e.g., managing change and movement). Regulatory mode theory is a motivational framework that highlights the ways in which these locomotion versus assessment concerns can receive differential emphasis across both individuals and situations. Although we know that locomotion motivation modulates goal-related movement, it is unclear whether these rather high-level concerns influence perceptual judgments of physical movement. Four studies investigated whether locomotion motivation also increases individuals’ perceptual judgments of movement. Across studies, whether locomotion motivation was measured (Studies 1a and 1b) or manipulated (Studies 2 and 3), individuals high in locomotion motivation judged more movement in static images relative to individuals chronically low in locomotion (Studies 1a and 1b) and to individuals in an assessment motivational state (Studies 2 and 3). Implications for understanding the nature of locomotion motivation, and motivated perceptual judgments more generally, are discussed.

Chapter,Research methods in medical and psychological hypnosis.,"Research methodology in hypnosis is a complex, multifaceted topic. In this brief chapter, given that the realm of hypnosis is full of startling, counterintuitive, and even 'magical' experiences and phenomena, we first devote some attention to the potential advantages of trying to cage such phenomena within the framework of rigorous research design. In particular, by referring to some classic experiments in the history of science, we outline major features of effective research design, which apply as fully to hypnosis as to any other domain. Next, we distinguish among three major types of hypnosis research, which require somewhat different handling of these basic design issues. Finally, we discuss a few of the specific design issues that arise in each of these areas of hypnosis research and provide references to literature in which further detail is available.

Journal,A class of weighted estimating equations for semiparametric transformation models with missing covariates.,"In survival analysis, covariate measurements often contain missing observations; ignoring this feature can lead to invalid inference. We propose a class of weighted estimating equations for right‐censored data with missing covariates under semiparametric transformation models. Time‐specific and subject‐specific weights are accommodated in the formulation of the weighted estimating equations. We establish unified results for estimating missingness probabilities that cover both parametric and non‐parametric modelling schemes. To improve estimation efficiency, the weighted estimating equations are augmented by a new set of unbiased estimating equations. The resultant estimator has the so‐called ‘double robustness’ property and is optimal within a class of consistent estimators.

Journal Article,Metapragmatics of mobility.,"This introduction presents a framework for analyzing the semiotic dimensions of mobility. Drawing upon the notion of pathway (Wortham & Reyes 2015), it examines how mobility is facilitated by semiotic processes that link linguistic emblems with speaker images across time and space (Agha 2007). It focuses on the circulation of discursive forms, facilitated by media technologies and complex patterns of transnational interaction, which ascribe identities to people on the move and root such identities within hierarchical structures of the market on local, national, and transnational scales. Looking at how interdiscursive networks intersect with people's experience of mobility and the way they position themselves in social space, this article problematizes the divide between ‘micro’ and ‘macro’ approaches, offering a historically grounded approach to operations of power that permeate both metapragmatic discourse and experiences of mobility.

Journal Article,Forming capital: Emblematizing discourses of mobility in South Korea.,"This article examines how listening subjects (Inoue 2006) mediate understandings of mobility in South Korea. Focusing on a cybercampaign to discredit the hip-hop star Tablo, it traces the ways that a listening public regimented signs relating to educational credentials, language, citizenship, and demeanor into forms of institutionalized, embodied, or objectified capital (Bourdieu 1986). Through the crafting of certain signs as icons that pointed to Tablo's ‘true’ character, and others as fronts, they were able to cast aspersions upon his command of English grammar, spelling, and interaction, and his character and educational credentials. By tracing how Tablo skeptics deployed metasemiotic discourses about emblems and figures of failed mobility, this article contributes to theories of semiosis that decenter the agentive speaking subject.

Journal Article,Wisdom in a complex world: A situated account of wise reasoning and its development.,"Social issues (e.g., partisan politics, economic decisions, and interpersonal conflicts) often involve trade‐offs, necessitating the consideration of multiple interests. Such issues do not have simple answers and benefit from wise reasoning—a set of metacognitive strategies that guide people toward managing complexity and balancing different interests. We review recent advances in research on wise reasoning, including evidence pertinent to the question of wisdom's trait‐like and state‐specific features, how it varies across situations, and how one can develop it. Overall, empirical studies suggest that researchers can understand wisdom better by paying attention to its situated nature across time and contexts.

Journal Article,Using behavioral analysis to prevent violent extremism: Assessing the cases of Michael Zehaf–Bibeau and Aaron Driver.,"The behavioral-analysis method has been an innovative and seemingly effective way to combat violent extremism in recent years. The model used for behavioral analysis as it relates to terrorism is now in practice among services such as the FBI. However, there has been little academic scrutiny of this method, especially with regard to how it could be used to improve wider counterterrorism policies. The behavioral-analysis method was used in this study to analyze 2 recent cases of homegrown, violent extremism in Canada. In so doing, it highlights some of the opportunities and challenges faced by counterterrorism practitioners attempting to use behavioral analysis to detect and deter violent attacks. The case-study assessments were also used to offer suggestions for improving counterterrorism policies in Canada and across the West, moving forward.

Journal,On the relation between reading difficulty and mind-wandering: A section-length account.,"In many situations, increasing task difficulty decreases thoughts that are unrelated to the task (i.e., mind-wandering). In the context of reading, however, recent research demonstrated that increasing passage reading difficulty actually increases mind-wandering rates (e.g., Feng et al. in Psychon Bull Rev 20:586–592, 2013). The primary goal of this research was to elucidate the mechanism that drives this positive relation. Across Experiments 1–3, we found evidence that the effect of Flesch–Kincaid reading difficulty on mind-wandering is partially driven by hard passages having longer sections of text (i.e., more words per screen) than easy passages when passages are presented one sentence at a time. In Experiment 4, we controlled for reading difficulty, and found that section length was positively associated with mind-wandering rates. We conclude by proposing that individuals may tend to disengage their attention from passages with relatively long sections of text because they appear to be more demanding than passages with shorter sections (even though objective task demands are equivalent).

Chapter,Base-rate neglect.,"Which car do you purchase? There is a strong temptation in situations such as this to ignore or underweight the base-rate probability of mechanical issues (i.e., based on the large sample of owners' experiences and expert opinion described in lieu of the more appealing single case. Indeed, when given hypothetical scenarios of this sort, participants often choose the 'Fiat' response - that is, the car that is probabilistically more likely to have mechanical issues but that has an intuitive appeal. Clearly, neglecting the base-rates can be expensive, if one opts for the repair-needy Fiat over the more reliable Subaru. The neglect or under weighting of base-rate probabilities has been demonstrated in a wide range of situations in both experimental and applied settings. In this chapter we will outline some of the ways that the base-rate fallacy has been investigated, discuss a debate about the extent of base-rate use, and, focusing on one particular form of base-rate neglect, we will outline recent work on the cognitive mechanisms that underlie the tendency to underweight or ignore base-rate information.

Journal,Detecting and dating structural breaks in functional data without dimension reduction.,"Summary Methodology is proposed to uncover structural breaks in functional data that is ‘fully functional’ in the sense that it does not rely on dimension reduction techniques. A thorough asymptotic theory is developed for a fully functional break detection procedure as well as for a break date estimator, assuming a fixed break size and a shrinking break size. The latter result is utilized to derive confidence intervals for the unknown break date. The main results highlight that the fully functional procedures perform best under conditions when analogous estimators based on functional principal component analysis are at their worst, namely when the feature of interest is orthogonal to the leading principal components of the data. The theoretical findings are confirmed by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study in finite samples. An application to annual temperature curves illustrates the practical relevance of the procedures proposed.

Comment/Reply,Brain stimulation effects on food cravings and consumption: An update on Lowe et al. (2017) and a response to Generoso et al. (2017).,"Reply by the current authors to the comments made by Marcelo B. Generoso et al. (see record 2017-40035-016) on the original article (see record 2017-03262-001). The authors recently published a meta-analysis describing the effects of noninvasive brain stimulation (neuromodulation) on food cravings and consumption. In this meta-analysis, we reported a significant effect of neuromodulation on cravings overall and further noted that the effect was significant for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) but not for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Authors found no overall effect of neuromodulation on food consumption, a finding that we attributed to insufficient statistical power in the presence of significant methodological variability in the assessment of eating behavior. In this letter, authors provide additional analyses and interpretation of the literature in this area and respond to a comment by Generoso and colleagues (in this issue of Psychosomatic Medicine) regarding their original meta-analysis.

Journal Article,Work and leisure in Thomas More’s Utopia.,"Relationship between work and leisure lays at the core of Thomas More’s political concerns and his vision of a Utopian society, but received little systematic research attention. This article addresses a question that has been often raised—whether Utopia expresses More’s views or is just a jest, since it in so many ways conflicts with his subsequent political stands and pronouncements. The article examines More’s vision of work and leisure within the context of his evolving social and political views and England’s political, economical and confessional challenges of the sixteenth century. The article proposes that the prospect of leisure offered in Utopia has been often simplified and the practice of a six-hour workday should not overshadow the fact that Utopians were expected to work 329 days a year and their leisure life was strongly regimented. The article suggests that, after being published, Utopia assumed its own life which foreshadowed both the challenges as well as some ominous aspects of future real-life Utopias. As a prophecy of a system of social justice and enlightened leisure Utopia failed, but it drew attention to the inherent dilemma of achieving a socially desirable and politically sustainable balance of work and leisure. More’s tragic end should not veil the relevancy of More’s intent (if not the solution) of bridging the gap between work and leisure—a task that remains remarkably salient today.

Journal Article,Tourism and gratitude: Valuing acts of kindness.,"Explorations of kindness and gratitude, a felt sense of thankfulness, are missing from tourism studies. Such explorations shed light on psychological value of relationships and social capital. We adopted a positive psychology theoretical lens to explore acts of kindness from strangers towards tourists and to understand how these acts are valued. To meet that aim, we conducted a study with twenty Canadian tourists. Through thematic analysis of semi structured, in-depth interviews, we identified these themes: trust in the other person; a sense of risk or adventurousness; novelty or authenticity of the experience; and eudaimonic growth, that is, receiving kindness from strangers indicated well-being beyond experiencing pleasures. Costs and benefits to benefactors were identified. We developed a model that explains how acts of kindness are personally valued by tourists.

Comment/Reply,The costs and benefits of a cigarette ban.,"The death toll from tobacco is staggering: it might contribute to one billion premature deaths over the course of the 21st century. In ‘The case for banning cigarettes’, Kalle Grill and Kristin Voigt argue that the well-being and equality benefits of a complete ban on cigarettes more than justify the restrictions on autonomy that such a ban would impose. Their argument depends on two crucial simplifications: an assumption that the ban would be effective and the restriction of the analysis to a comparison with the status quo, rather than a broader range of policy options. I argue that despite the authors’ claims, these two simplifications make it impossible for their argument to ‘bring into focus the fundamental normative issues’ surrounding a possible cigarette ban, since they dramatically overstate the benefits and obscure the most significant costs of such a ban.

Journal Article,Disfluency effects on lexical selection.,"Recent research has suggested that introducing a disfluency in the context of written composition (i.e., typing with one hand) can increase lexical sophistication. In the current study, we provide a strong test between two accounts of this phenomenon, one that attributes it to the delay caused by the disfluency and one that attributes it to the disruption of typical finger-to-letter mappings caused by the disfluency. To test between these accounts, we slowed down participants’ typewriting by introducing a small delay between keystrokes while individuals wrote essays. Critically, this manipulation did not disrupt typical finger-to-letter mappings. Consistent with the delay-based account, our results demonstrate that the essays written in this less fluent condition were more lexically diverse and used less frequent words. Implications for the temporal dynamics of lexical selection in complex cognitive tasks are discussed.

Journal Article,Built-in bad luck: Evidence of near-miss outcomes by design in scratch cards.,"Scratch cards are a pervasive form of gambling in the Canadian marketplace. Despite their widespread appeal, we are only beginning to understand the influence of their structural characteristics on the player. The most widely studied of these characteristics is the near-miss, a game outcome in which the player gets two of the three needed symbols to win a jackpot prize. Although other authors have noted the existence of these outcomes in scratch cards, no systematic investigation has been undertaken to understand their occurrence in these games. We present the results of an analysis to determine the frequency of these outcomes using two samples (sample A, n = 41; sample B, n = 61) of a popular scratch card game available in Ontario, Canada. Our results suggest that certain scratch card games may be designed to include more pairs of jackpot symbols (i.e., more near-miss outcomes) than any other symbol pair. In the game that we analyzed, the top prize symbol occurred more often than any other symbol and appeared to be manipulated to appear in clusters of two, creating many near-miss outcomes to the jackpot prize. This work has strong implications for the study of gambling behaviour, responsible gambling strategies, as well as for the scientific investigation of scratch card games.

Journal Article,"What are mixed emotions and what conditions foster them? Life-span experiences, culture and social awareness.","‘Mixed emotions’ is often used synonymously with the notion of complex emotional experiences. Emotional complexity can also mean differentiation of emotions, both within and across situations. We review empirical evidence concerning the relationship between various forms of emotional complexity, integrating them in a general conceptual framework. Mixed emotions converge with other metrics of complexity when accounting for the same level of analysis (across time vs. state-specific) and less so when crossing these levels. Moreover, mixed emotions and other forms of complexity appear to vary as a function of various contextual factors, including age, culture, and situation. In particular, contexts promoting focus beyond one’s immediate point of view appear to facilitate emotional complexity more than self-focused contexts.

Journal Article,“Because it's hers”: When preschoolers use ownership in their explanations.,"Young children show competence in reasoning about how ownership affects object use. In the present experiments, we investigate how influential ownership is for young children by examining their explanations. In three experiments, we asked 3- to 5-year-olds (N = 323) to explain why it was acceptable (Experiments 1–3) or unacceptable (Experiment 2 and 3) for a person to use an object. In Experiments 1 and 2, older preschoolers referenced ownership more than alternative considerations when explaining why it was acceptable or unacceptable for a person to use an object, even though ownership was not mentioned to them. In Experiment 3, ownership was mentioned to children. Here, younger preschoolers frequently referenced ownership when explaining unacceptability of using an object, but not when explaining why using it was acceptable. These findings suggest that ownership is influential in preschoolers’ explanations about the acceptability of using objects, but that the scope of its influence increases with age.

Journal Article,Exploring the relationship of task performance and physical and cognitive fatigue during a daylong light precision task.,"Objective: Our aim was to explore the relationship between fatigue and operation system performance during a simulated light precision task over an 8-hr period using a battery of physical (central and peripheral) and cognitive measures. Background: Fatigue may play an important role in the relationship between poor ergonomics and deficits in quality and productivity. However, well-controlled laboratory studies in this area have several limitations, including the lack of work relevance of fatigue exposures and lack of both physical and cognitive measures. There remains a need to understand the relationship between physical and cognitive fatigue and task performance at exposure levels relevant to realistic production or light precision work. Method: Errors and fatigue measures were tracked over the course of a micropipetting task. Fatigue responses from 10 measures and errors in pipetting technique, precision, and targeting were submitted to principal component analysis to descriptively analyze features and patterns. Results: Fatigue responses and error rates contributed to three principal components (PCs), accounting for 50.9% of total variance. Fatigue responses grouped within the three PCs reflected central and peripheral upper extremity fatigue, postural sway, and changes in oculomotor behavior. Conclusion: In an 8-hr light precision task, error rates shared similar patterns to both physical and cognitive fatigue responses, and/or increases in arousal level. Application: The findings provide insight toward the relationship between fatigue and operation system performance (e.g., errors). This study contributes to a body of literature documenting task errors and fatigue, reflecting physical (both central and peripheral) and cognitive processes.

Journal Article,Non‐uniform phase sensitivity in spatial frequency maps of the human visual cortex.,"Complex natural scenes can be decomposed into their oriented spatial frequency (SF) and phase relationships, both of which are represented locally at the earliest stages of cortical visual processing. The SF preference map in the human cortex, obtained using synthetic stimuli, is orderly and correlates strongly with eccentricity. In addition, early visual areas show sensitivity to the phase information that describes the relationship between SFs and thereby dictates the structure of the image. Taken together, two possibilities arise for the joint representation of SF and phase: either the entirety of the cortical SF map is uniformly sensitive to phase, or a particular set of SFs is selectively phase sensitive—for example, greater phase sensitivity for higher SFs that define fine‐scale edges in a complex scene. To test between these two possibilities, we constructed a novel continuous natural scene video whereby phase information was maintained in one SF band but scrambled elsewhere. By shifting the central frequency of the phase‐aligned band in time, we mapped the phase‐sensitive SF preference of the visual cortex. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that phase sensitivity in early visual areas is biased toward higher SFs. Compared to a SF map of the same scene obtained using linear‐filtered stimuli, a much larger patch of areas V1 and V2 is sensitive to the phase alignment of higher SFs. The results of early areas cannot be explained by attention. Our results suggest non‐uniform sensitivity to phase alignment in population‐level SF representations, with phase alignment being particularly important for fine‐scale edge representations of natural scenes.

Journal Article,Disrupting monotony while increasing demand: Benefits of rest and intervening tasks on vigilance.,"In the experiments presented here, we examined the impact of intervening tasks on the vigilance decrement. In Experiment 1 participants either (a) continuously performed a visuospatial vigilance task, (b) received a rest break, or (c) temporarily performed a different, demanding visuospatial task in the middle of the vigil. Both taking a rest break and performing the intervening task were found to alleviate the vigilance decrement in response times. Target detection accuracy was equivalent across groups. In Experiment 2 we obtained subjective ratings of task demand, boredom, motivation, and mind wandering for both the vigilance task and intervening task administered in Experiment 1. The intervening task was rated as more demanding in terms of mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, own performance, effort, and frustration. In addition, participants also reported being more bored, less motivated, and reported mind wandering more frequently when completing the vigil. Disruptions to task monotony (even if cognitively demanding), can alleviate the vigilance decrement. The implications of this finding with respect to current theoretical accounts of the vigilance decrement are discussed.

Journal Article,Metatation: Annotation as implicit interaction to bridge close and distant reading.,"In the domain of literary criticism, many critics practice close reading, annotating by hand while performing a detailed analysis of a single text. Often this process employs the use of external resources to aid analysis. In this article, we present a study and subsequent tool design focused on leveraging a critic’s annotations as implicit interactions for initiating context-specific computational support that automatically searches external resources. We observed 14 poetry critics performing a close reading, revealing a set of cognitive practices supported through free-form annotation that have not previously been discussed in this context. We used guidelines derived from our study to design a tool, Metatation, which uses a pen-and-paper system with a peripheral display to utilize reader annotations as underspecified interactions to augment close reading. By turning paper-based annotations into implicit queries, Metatation provides relevant supplemental information in a just-in-time manner and acts as a bridge between close and distant reading.

Journal Article,"Cross-country comparison of smokers’ reasons for thinking about quitting over time: Findings from the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey (ITC-4C), 2002–2015.","Objective: To explore between-country differences and within-country trends over time in smokers’ reasons for thinking about quitting and the relationship between reasons and making a quit attempt. Methods: Participants were nationally representative samples of adult smokers from the UK (N = 4717), Canada (N = 4884), the USA (N = 6703) and Australia (N = 4482), surveyed as part of the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey between 2002 and 2015. Generalised estimating equations were used to evaluate differences among countries in smokers’ reasons for thinking about quitting and their association with making a quit attempt at follow-up wave. Results: Smokers’ concern for personal health was consistently the most frequently endorsed reason for thinking about quitting in each country and across waves, and was most strongly associated with making a quit attempt. UK smokers were less likely than their counterparts to endorse health concerns, but were more likely to endorse medication and quitline availability reasons. Canadian smokers endorsed the most reasons, and smokers in the USA and Australia increased in number of reasons endorsed over the course of the study period. Endorsement of health warnings, and perhaps price, appears to peak in the year or so after the change is introduced, whereas other responses were not immediately linked to policy changes. Conclusions: Differences in reasons for thinking about quitting exist among smokers in countries with different histories of tobacco control policies.

Journal Article,Association between fine motor skills and binocular visual function in children with reading difficulties.,"Performance of fine motor skills (FMS) assessed by a clinical test battery has been associated with reading achievement in school-age children. However, the nature of this association remains to be established. The aim of this study was to assess FMS in children with reading difficulties using two experimental tasks, and to determine if performance is associated with reduced binocular function. We hypothesized that in comparison to an age- and sex-matched control group, children identified with reading difficulties will perform worse only on a motor task that has been shown to rely on binocular input. To test this hypothesis, motor performance was assessed using two tasks: bead-threading and peg-board in 19 children who were reading below expected grade and age-level. Binocular vision assessment included tests for stereoacuity, fusional vergence, amplitude of accommodation, and accommodative facility. In comparison to the control group, children with reading difficulties performed significantly worse on the bead-threading task. In contrast, performance on the peg-board task was similar in both groups. Accommodative facility was the only measure of binocular function significantly associated with motor performance. Findings from our exploratory study suggest that normal binocular vision may provide an important sensory input for the optimal development of FMS and reading. Given the small sample size tested in the current study, further investigation to assess the contribution of binocular vision to the development and performance of FMS and reading is warranted.

Journal Article,Consistency between verbal and non-verbal affective cues: A clue to speaker credibility.,"Listeners are exposed to inconsistencies in communication; for example, when speakers’ words (i.e. verbal) are discrepant with their demonstrated emotions (i.e. non-verbal). Such inconsistencies introduce ambiguity, which may render a speaker to be a less credible source of information. Two experiments examined whether children make credibility discriminations based on the consistency of speakers’ affect cues. In Experiment 1, school-age children (7- to 8-year-olds) preferred to solicit information from consistent speakers (e.g. those who provided a negative statement with negative affect), over novel speakers, to a greater extent than they preferred to solicit information from inconsistent speakers (e.g. those who provided a negative statement with positive affect) over novel speakers. Preschoolers (4- to 5-year-olds) did not demonstrate this preference. Experiment 2 showed that school-age children's ratings of speakers were influenced by speakers’ affect consistency when the attribute being judged was related to information acquisition (speakers’ believability, “weird” speech), but not general characteristics (speakers’ friendliness, likeability). Together, findings suggest that school-age children are sensitive to, and use, the congruency of affect cues to determine whether individuals are credible sources of information.

Journal Article,The wisdom in virtue: Pursuit of virtue predicts wise reasoning about personal conflicts.,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 28(12) of Psychological Science (see record 2017-56249-017). In the original article results for the Pursuit of Virtue × Conflict Type interaction in Study 2 were incorrectly reported. The correct results are present in the erratum.] Most people can reason relatively wisely about others’ social conflicts, but often struggle to do so about their own (i.e., Solomon’s paradox). We suggest that true wisdom should involve the ability to reason wisely about both others’ and one’s own social conflicts, and we investigated the pursuit of virtue as a construct that predicts this broader capacity for wisdom. Results across two studies support prior findings regarding Solomon’s paradox: Participants (N = 623) more strongly endorsed wise-reasoning strategies (e.g., intellectual humility, adopting an outsider’s perspective) for resolving other people’s social conflicts than for resolving their own. The pursuit of virtue (e.g., pursuing personal ideals and contributing to other people) moderated this effect of conflict type. In both studies, greater endorsement of the pursuit of virtue was associated with greater endorsement of wise-reasoning strategies for one’s own personal conflicts; as a result, participants who highly endorsed the pursuit of virtue endorsed wise-reasoning strategies at similar levels for resolving their own social conflicts and resolving other people’s social conflicts. Implications of these results and underlying mechanisms are explored and discussed.

Journal Article,Listeners learn phonotactic patterns conditioned on suprasegmental cues.,"Language learners are sensitive to phonotactic patterns from an early age, and can acquire both simple and 2nd-order positional restrictions contingent on segment identity (e.g., /f/ is an onset with /æ/but a coda with /ɪ/). The present study explored the learning of phonototactic patterns conditioned on a suprasegmental cue: lexical stress. Adults first heard non-words in which trochaic and iambic items had different consonant restrictions. In Experiment 1, participants trained with phonotactic patterns involving natural classes of consonants later falsely recognized novel items that were consistent with the training patterns (legal items), demonstrating that they had learned the stress-conditioned phonotactic patterns. However, this was only true for iambic items. In Experiment 2, participants completed a forced-choice test between novel legal and novel illegal items and were again successful only for the iambic items. Experiment 3 demonstrated learning for trochaic items when they were presented alone. Finally, in Experiment 4, in which the training phase was lengthened, participants successfully learned both sets of phonotactic patterns. These experiments provide evidence that learners consider more global phonological properties in the computation of phonotactic patterns, and that learners can acquire multiple sets of patterns simultaneously, even contradictory ones.

Journal Article,Enhanced motor imagery-based bci performance via tactile stimulation on unilateral hand.,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) has attracted great interests for its effectiveness in assisting disabled people. However, due to the poor BCI performance, this technique is still far from daily-life applications. One of critical issues confronting BCI research is how to enhance BCI performance. This study aimed at improving the motor imagery (MI) based BCI accuracy by integrating MI tasks with unilateral tactile stimulation (Uni-TS). The effects were tested on both healthy subjects and stroke patients in a controlled study. Twenty-two healthy subjects and four stroke patients were recruited and randomly divided into a control-group and an enhanced-group. In the control-group, subjects performed two blocks of conventional MI tasks (left hand vs. right hand), with 80 trials in each block. In the enhanced-group, subjects also performed two blocks of MI tasks, but constant tactile stimulation was applied on the non-dominant/paretic hand during MI tasks in the second block. We found the Uni-TS significantly enhanced the contralateral cortical activations during MI of the stimulated hand, whereas it had no influence on activation patterns during MI of the non-stimulated hand. The two-class BCI decoding accuracy was significantly increased from 72.5% (MI without Uni-TS) to 84.7% (MI with Uni-TS) in the enhanced-group (p80% during MI with Uni-TS. This novel approach complements the conventional methods for BCI enhancement without increasing source information or complexity of signal processing. This enhancement via Uni-TS may facilitate clinical applications of MI-BCI.

Journal Article,"Workload, risks, and goal framing as antecedents of shortcut behaviors.","Purpose: Shortcut behaviors are methods of completing a task that require less time than typical or standard procedures. These behaviors carry the benefit of increasing efficiency, yet can also carry risks (e.g., of an accident). The purpose of this research is to understand the reasons individuals engage in shortcut behaviors, even when doing so is known to be risky. Design/Methodology/Approach: We present two laboratory studies (N = 121 and N = 144) in which participants performed an air traffic control simulation. Participants could improve efficiency by taking shortcuts; that is, by sending aircraft off the prescribed flight paths. This design allowed for direct and unobtrusive observation of shortcut behaviors. Findings: Individuals who were told that efficiency was an obligation tended to believe that shortcut behaviors had utility for managing high workloads, even when the risks associated with shortcuts were high. Downstream, utility perceptions were positively related to actual shortcut behavior. Implications: Although communicating risks may be used to help individuals balance the “pros” and “cons” of shortcut behaviors, goal framing is also important. Subtle cues indicating that efficiency is an obligation can lead to elevated perceptions of the utility of shortcut behaviors, even when knowing that engaging in shortcut behaviors is very risky. Originality/Value: Past research has provided limited insights into the reasons individuals sometimes engage in shortcut behaviors even when doing so is known to be risky. The current research speaks to this issue by identifying workload and obligation framing as antecedents of the decision to take shortcuts.

Journal Article,"Prevalence of, and resident and facility characteristics associated with antipsychotic use in assisted living vs. long-term care facilities: A cross-sectional analysis from Alberta, Canada.","Background: Potentially inappropriate antipsychotic use in long-term care (LTC) facilities has been the focus of significant policy and clinical attention over the past 20 years. However, most initiatives aimed at reducing the use of these medications have overlooked assisted living (AL) settings. Objective: We sought to compare the prevalence of antipsychotic use (including potentially inappropriate use) among older AL and LTC residents and to explore the resident and facility-level factors associated with use in these two populations. Methods: We performed cross-sectional analyses of 1089 residents (mean age 85 years; 77% female) from 59 AL facilities and 1000 residents (mean age 85 years; 66% female) from 54 LTC facilities, in Alberta, Canada. Research nurses completed comprehensive resident assessments at baseline (2006–2007). Facility-level factors were assessed using standardized administrator interviews. Generalized linear models were used to estimate odds ratios for associations, accounting for clustering by facility. Results: Over a quarter of residents in AL (26.4%) and LTC (31.8%) were using antipsychotics (p = 0.006). Prevalence of potentially inappropriate use was similar in AL and LTC (23.4 vs. 26.8%, p = 0.09). However, among users, the proportion of antipsychotic use deemed potentially inappropriate was significantly higher in AL than LTC (AL: 231/287 = 80.5%; LTC: 224/318 = 70.4%; p = 0.004). In both settings, comparable findings regarding associations between resident characteristics (including dementia, psychiatric disorders, frailty, behavioral symptoms, and antidepressant use) and antipsychotic use were observed. Few facility characteristics were associated with overall antipsychotic use, but having a pharmacist on staff (AL), or an affiliated physician (LTC) was associated with a lower likelihood of potentially inappropriate antipsychotic use. Conclusion: Our findings illustrate the importance of including AL settings in clinical and policy initiatives aimed at reducing inappropriate antipsychotic use among older vulnerable residents.

Journal Article,Predictive aids can lead to sustained attention decrements in the detection of non-routine critical events in event monitoring.,"Task performance in uncertain and complex environments is dependent on human effectiveness in dynamic prioritisation and attention allocation. Non-routine critical events place a high demand on cognitive resources in operators, and they require operators to dynamically re-prioritise sub-tasks calling upon the need for predictive aids. Predictive aids provide real-time prediction of system variables, and they can potentially facilitate the detection of non-routine critical events and dynamic re-prioritisation during such events. However, prior research has reported mixed findings in their effectiveness, and no prior research has been done to test the effectiveness of predictive aids during non-routine critical events that require operators to dynamically prioritise tasks. Our experimental study with 77 participants examined the effect of a predictive aid on prioritisation of non-routine critical events in a cyber security event monitoring task. The predictive aid resulted in decrements in sustained attention as seen in delayed detection of some non-routine critical events and errors in prioritising non-routine critical events. This effect is a result of miscalibration in the importance of looking ahead with the predictive aid. This miscalibration was possibly associated with the look-ahead time, complexity of the predictive aid, and the lack of automation transparency (i.e. mechanism underlying prediction) together affecting its perceived usefulness. The experimental results have the following implications on the design and testing of predictive aids: (1) in a task requiring dynamic prioritisation and detection of non-routine critical events, predictive aids with insufficient look-ahead times can result in decrements in sustained attention; (2) predictive aids should be evaluated with subjective measures of perceived usefulness and workload; (3) predictive aids should be designed to have sufficient look-ahead times and transparency of underlying prediction mechanisms as these would affect visual scanning effort and perceived usefulness; and (4) experimental tests of their effectiveness should involve scenarios long enough that would take sustained attention effects and any potential learning effects into consideration.

Journal Article,The effects of advertised quality emphasis and objective quality on sales.,"Given that consumers value quality, and advertising content informs consumers' beliefs about quality, it is not surprising that high-quality brands emphasize quality in their advertising content. What is less obvious is whether firms with lower-quality brands should also follow suit and emphasize quality in their advertising to signal a higher quality. We examine this issue and study the effectiveness of quality-based advertising messages. Our field study relates brands' monthly sales to their advertised quality claims across 1,876 print ads in national magazines and Consumer Reports-based product quality ratings over more than two decades. Contrary to the generally held yet erroneous belief in the efficacy of low-quality products emphasizing quality in their advertising, we demonstrate that (1) it is not beneficial for a low-quality firm to emphasize quality in its advertising, and (2) it is effective for a high-quality firm to do so. An analysis of parameter values from a published category-agnostic simulation and an experiment that examines consumers' responses to quality claims in a second product category yields convergent insights.

Journal Article,The residual protective effects of enactment.,"Research has demonstrated the importance of the quality of initial retrieval events (Test 1) for performance on later memory tests (Test 2). We explored whether enacting words at encoding, relative to simply reading them, provided protection against the detrimental effects of a degraded retrieval experience, through the addition of motor processing to the extant memory representation. Participants encoded a mixed list of enacted and read words, then completed Test 1, and a later Test 2. Encoding and Test 2 were always completed under full attention (FA). Critically though, Test 1 was completed either under FA, or under divided attention (DA) with a distracting task requiring semantic and phonological processing. We predicted a larger enactment effect following DA relative to FA, indicating greater preservation of enacted words from dual-task interference. In Experiment 1, we demonstrated that the enactment effect was indeed larger following DA than FA, indicating greater preservation of enacted words after dual-task interference. In Experiment 2, we showed that this effect was even more potent over longer time scales, which served as a conceptual replication. In Experiment 3, we showed that enactment provides little to no protection when the distracting task requires motor processing, and in Experiment 4, we returned to the phonological distracting task and showed that in contrast with enactment, generation at encoding does not afford the same protection to memory. Taken together, these finding suggest that enactment renders words relatively immune to the detrimental effects of dual-tasking during testing, through the addition of a different kind, rather than a greater degree, of processing to the memory trace at encoding.

Journal Article,"Patient, staff, and clinician perspectives on implementing electronic communications in an interdisciplinary rural family health practice.","Aim: To conduct an environmental scan of a rural primary care clinic to assess the feasibility of implementing an e-communications system between patients and clinic staff. Background: Increasing demands on healthcare require greater efficiencies in communications and services, particularly in rural areas. E-communications may improve clinic efficiency and delivery of healthcare but raises concerns about patient privacy and data security. Methods: We conducted an environmental scan at one family health team clinic, a high-volume interdisciplinary primary care practice in rural southwestern Ontario, Canada, to determine the feasibility of implementing an e-communications system between its patients and staff. A total of 28 qualitative interviews were conducted (with six physicians, four phone nurses, four physicians’ nurses, five receptionists, one business office attendant, five patients, and three pharmacists who provide care to the clinic’s patients) along with quantitative surveys of 131 clinic patients. Findings: Patients reported using the internet regularly for multiple purposes. Patients indicated they would use email to communicate with their family doctor for prescription refills (65% of respondents), appointment booking (63%), obtaining lab results (60%), and education (50%). Clinic staff expressed concerns about patient confidentiality and data security, the timeliness, complexity and responsibility of responses, and increased workload. Conclusion: Clinic staff members are willing to use an e-communications system but clear guidelines are needed for successful adoption and to maintain privacy of patient health data. E-communications might improve access to and quality of care in rural primary care practices.

Journal Article,Persistent perceptual delay for active head movement onset relative to sound onset with and without vision.,"Knowing when the head moves is crucial information for the central nervous system to maintain a veridical representation of the self in the world for perception and action. Previous studies have shown that active head movement onset has to precede a sound by approximately 80 ms to be perceived as simultaneous, suggesting that the perceived timing of head movement is slow. However, this research was conducted with closed eyes. Given that visual information is available for most natural head movements, could perceptual delays in head movement onset be related to removing vision? Here, we examined whether visual information affects the perceived timing of active head movement onset. Participants performed a series of temporal order judgment tasks between their active head movement and an auditory tone presented at various stimulus onset asynchronies. Visual information was either absent (eyes closed) or present while either maintaining fixation on an earth or head-fixed target in the dark or in the light. Results show that head movement onset has to precede a sound by ~76 ms with eyes closed confirming previous work. The results also suggest that head movement onset must still precede a sound when fixating targets in the dark with a trend for the head having to move with less lead time with visual information and with the vestibulo-ocular reflex active or suppressed (~70 to 48 ms). Together, these results suggest that the perception of head movement onset is persistently delayed and is not fully resolved even with full field visual input.

Journal Article,Compatibilism can be natural.,"Compatibilism is the view that moral responsibility is compatible with determinism. Natural compatibilism is the view that in ordinary social cognition, people are compatibilists. Researchers have recently debated whether natural compatibilism is true. This paper presents six experiments (N = 909) that advance this debate. The results provide the best evidence to date for natural compatibilism, avoiding the main methodological problems faced by previous work supporting the view. In response to simple scenarios about familiar activities, people judged that agents had moral responsibilities to perform actions that they were unable to perform (Experiment 1), were morally responsible for unavoidable outcomes (Experiment 2), were to blame for unavoidable outcomes (Experiments 3–4), deserved blame for unavoidable outcomes (Experiment 5), and should suffer consequences for unavoidable outcomes (Experiment 6). These findings advance our understanding of moral psychology and philosophical debates that depend partly on patterns in commonsense morality.

Journal Article,What did you have in mind? Examining the content of intentional and unintentional types of mind wandering.,"It has recently been argued that researchers should distinguish between mind wandering (MW) that is engaged with and without intention. Supporting this argument, studies have found that intentional and unintentional MW have behavioral/neural differences, and that they are differentially associated with certain variables of theoretical interest. Although there have been considerable inroads made into the distinction between intentional/unintentional MW, possible differences in their content remain unexplored. To determine whether these two types of MW differ in content, we had participants complete a task during which they categorized their MW as intentional or unintentional, and then provided responses to questions about the content of their MW. Results indicated that intentional MW was more frequently rated as being future-oriented and less vague than unintentional MW. These findings shed light on the nature of intentional and unintentional MW and provide support for the argument that researchers should distinguish between intentional and unintentional types.

Journal Article,The effects of task-relevant saccadic eye movements performed during the encoding of a serial sequence on visuospatial memory performance.,"Visuospatial working memory (VSWM) is a set of cognitive processes used to encode, maintain and manipulate spatial information. One important feature of VSWM is that it has a limited capacity such that only few items can be actively stored and manipulated simultaneously. Given the limited capacity, it is important to determine the conditions that affect memory performance as this will improve our understanding of the architecture and function of VSWM. Previous studies have shown that VSWM is disrupted when task-irrelevant eye movements are performed during the maintenance phase; however, relatively fewer studies examined the role of eye movements performed during the encoding phase. On one hand, performing eye movements during the encoding phase could result in a stronger memory trace because the memory formation is reinforced by the activation of the motor system. On the other hand, performing eye movements to each target could disrupt the configural processing of the spatial array because the spatial representation has to be updated with each movement to maintain perceptual stability. Therefore, this work was conducted to examine whether task-relevant saccadic eye movements performed during the encoding phase of a visuospatial working memory task affect the recall of serially presented targets. Results from two experiments showed that average recall accuracy was significantly higher when the spatial array (set size ≥ 7) was encoded using a covert strategy—that is, while participants fixated on a central target, in comparison to an overt strategy—that is, while participants moved their eyes to fixate on each target. Furthermore, the improvement in accuracy was evident only for targets presented in the first half of the sequence, suggesting that the primacy effect is modulated by the presence of eye movements. We propose that executing saccades during encoding could interfere with the ability to use a chunking strategy or disrupt active visualization of the configuration. In conclusion, this is the first study to show that task-relevant saccadic eye movements performed during encoding may actually reduce the spatial span of VSWM. These results extend the current knowledge about the role of eye movements in VSWM, and have implications for future studies investigating the VSWM.

Journal Article,"Strategy, complexity and cooperation: The Sino-American climate regime.","The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution is applied to a potential climate negotiation between the United States of America (USA) and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in order to gain strategic insights into how a successful agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could be reached. In light of the failure of many nations to meet their expected Kyoto Protocol emission reduction targets and the lack of involvement of the world’s greatest emitters of airborne pollutants, the USA and PRC, there is a need to determine successful strategies for combating climate change. The issues surrounding the potential implementation of a bilateral agreement between the USA and PRC are systematically analyzed. Information gathered about the decision makers, options and preferences within the potential negotiations is utilized to create a valid conflict model which is used as a basis for carrying out strategic analyses. Moreover, a novel method is implemented within the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution to gain insights into the impact of attitudes on these negotiations. The strategic findings reflect reasonably well what actually occurred in November 2014 when the USA and PRC negotiated a bilateral deal.

Journal Article,Autobiographical and episodic memory deficits in mild traumatic brain injury.,"Those who have suffered a concussion, otherwise known as a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), often complain of lingering memory problems. However, there is little evidence in the behavioral literature reliably demonstrating memory deficits. Thus, in the present study, cognitive profiles including measures of general executive functioning and processing speed, as well as episodic and semantic memory were collected in younger and older adult participants with or without a remote (>1 year prior to testing) mTBI. We first investigated whether there were observable episodic and autobiographical memory impairments associated with mTBI within an otherwise healthy young group. Next, because previous work had demonstrated some overlap in patterns of behavioral impairment in normally aging adults and younger adults with a history of mTBI (e.g. Ozen, Fernandes, Clark, & Roy, 2015), we sought to determine whether these groups displayed similar cognitive profiles. Lastly, we conducted an exploratory analysis to test whether having suffered an mTBI might exacerbate age-related cognitive decline. Results showed the expected age-related decline in episodic memory performance, coupled with a relative preservation of semantic memory in older adults. Importantly, this pattern was also present in younger adults with a history of remote mTBI. No differences were observed across older adult groups based on mTBI status. Logistic regression analyses, using each measure in our battery as a predictor, successfully classified mTBI status in younger participants with a high degree of specificity (79.5%). These results indicate that those who have had an mTBI demonstrate a distinct cognitive signature, characterized by impairment in episodic and autobiographical memory, coupled with a relative preservation of semantic memory.

Journal Article,"Fashion interest as a driver for consumer textile waste management: Reuse, recycle or disposal.","Past studies have considered the impact of fashion on consumer textile disposal behaviour, but have focused mainly on drivers of clothing waste. There is a lack of research that examines consumer attitudes towards fashion and their disposal methods. This study conducted an online survey of 410 people in Ontario, Canada with varying demographic characteristics to assess how they currently manage their textile waste including resell, swap, take‐back, donation and disposal. Respondents were asked about their fashion interest and shopping frequency and were assigned a fashion index value. The fashion index value is not a means of grouping consumers but is instead a continuum to model interest in fashion, with one extreme representing fashion consumers and the other representing non‐fashion consumers. Statistical analysis was then used to establish whether there is a link between textile waste behaviour and fashion index. The results indicate that consumers with a high fashion index (i.e. fashion consumers) and consumers with low fashion index (i.e. non‐fashion consumers) manage their textile waste differently. While the majority of participants donate and dispose of unwanted clothes, fashion consumers are more interested and more likely to participate in alternative methods (e.g. resell, swap, and take back) for removing unwanted textiles. Although fashion consumers produce more textile waste than non‐fashion consumers, textile consumption cannot be directly equated with textile waste since fashion consumers were found to have a lower disposal rate than non‐fashion consumers (38 percent to 50 percent, respectively). The distinct disposal characteristics of fashion and non‐fashion consumers (i.e. interest and willingness to participate in alternative channels) allows strategies to be tailored accordingly so that the amount of waste going to landfill can be reduced.

Journal Article,Ask in person: You're less persuasive than you think over email.,"Research has found people underestimate the likelihood strangers will comply with their direct requests (Bohns, 2016; Flynn & Lake (Bohns), 2008). Here we argue this “underestimation-of-compliance effect” may be limited to requests made face-to-face. We find when making direct requests over email, requesters instead overestimate compliance. In two studies, participants asked strangers to comply with requests either face-to-face or over email. Before making these requests, requesters estimated the number of people they expected to say “yes”. While requesters underestimated compliance in face-to-face contexts, replicating previous research, they overestimated compliance in email contexts. Analyses of several theorized mechanisms for this finding suggest that requesters, anchored on their own perspectives, fail to appreciate the suspicion, and resulting lack of empathy, with which targets view email requests from strangers. Given the prevalence of email and text-based communication, this is an extremely important moderator of the underestimation-of-compliance effect.

Journal Article,Occupant thorax response variations due to arm position and restraint systems in side impact crash scenarios.,"Recent epidemiological studies have identified that thoracic side airbags may vary in efficacy to reduce injury severity in side impact crash scenarios, while previous experimental and epidemiological studies have presented contrasting results. This study aimed to quantify the variations in occupant response in side impact conditions using a human body computational model integrated with a full vehicle model. The model was analyzed for a Moving Deformable Barrier side impact at 61km/h to assess two pre-crash arm positions, the incorporation of a seatbelt, and a thorax air bag on thorax response. The occupant response was evaluated using chest compression, the viscous criterion and thoracic spinal curvature. The arm position accounted for largest changes in the thorax response (106%) compared to the presence of the airbag and seatbelt systems (75%). It was also noted that the results were dependant on the method and location of thorax response measurement and this should be investigated further. Assessment using lateral displacement of the thoracic spine correlated positively with chest compression and Viscous Criterion, with the benefit of evaluating whole thorax response and provides a useful metric to compare occupant response for different side impact safety systems. The thoracic side airbag was found to increase the chest compression for the driving arm position (+70%), and reduced the injury metrics for the vertical arm position (−17%). This study demonstrated the importance of occupant arm position on variability in thoracic response, and provides insight for future design and optimization of side impact safety systems.

Journal Article,The cumulative effect of frailty and cognition on mortality—Results of a prospective cohort study.,"Background: Both physical frailty and cognitive impairment predict death, but the joint effect of these two factors is uncertain. The objectives are to determine if the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and the Frailty Index (FI) predict death over a five-year interval after accounting for the effect of the other; and if there is an interaction in this effect. Methods: An analysis of an existing prospective cohort study of 1,751 community living older adults followed over a five-year time frame. Age, gender, and education were self-reported. The predictor variables were the FI—a measure of frailty based on the “Accumulation of Deficits” model of frailty; and the MMSE. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for the outcome of time to death. Results: The unadjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) for mortality was 2.17 (1.69, 2.80) for those who were only cognitively impaired, 2.02 (1.53, 2.68) for those who were only frail, and 3.57 (2.75, 4.62) for those who were both frail and cognitively impaired with the reference group of those who were neither frail nor cognitively impaired. Adjusted for age, gender, and education, the HR (95% CI) was 1.49 (1.13. 1.95) for those who were only cognitively impaired, 1.81 (1.35, 2.41) for those who were only frail, and 2.28 (1.69, 3.09) for those who were both frail and cognitively impaired. Conclusions: Both frailty and cognitive impairment are predictors of mortality and the effect is cumulative. There was no interaction in this effect.

Journal Article,Effects of noninvasive brain stimulation on food cravings and consumption: A meta-analytic review.,"Objective: The primary aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of noninvasive brain stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) for modulating appetitive food cravings and consumption in laboratory (via meta-analysis) and therapeutic (via systematic review) contexts. Methods: Keyword searches of electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and EMBASE) and searches of previous quantitative reviews were used to identify studies (experimental [single-session] or randomized trials [multi-session]) that examined the effects of neuromodulation to the dlPFC on food cravings (n = 9) and/or consumption (n = 7). Random-effects models were employed to estimate the overall and method-specific (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation [rTMS] and transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS]) effect sizes. Age and body mass index were examined as potential moderators. Two studies involving multisession therapeutic stimulation were considered in a separate systematic review. Results: Findings revealed a moderate-sized effect of modulation on cravings across studies (g, −0.516; p = .037); this effect was subject to significant heterogeneity (Q, 33.086; p g, −0.834; p = .008) but not tDCS (g, −0.252; p = .37). There was not sufficient evidence to support a causal effect of neuromodulation and consumption in experimental studies; therapeutic studies reported mixed findings. Conclusions: Stimulation of the dlPFC modulates cravings for appetitive foods in single-session laboratory paradigms; when estimated separately, the effect size is only significant for rTMS protocols. Effects on consumption in laboratory contexts were not reliable across studies, but this may reflect methodological variability in delivery of stimulation and assessment of eating behavior. Additional single- and multi-session studies assessing eating behavior outcomes are needed.

Journal Article,Psychological morbidity among Australian rural and urban support persons of haematological cancer survivors: Results of a national study.,"Objective: To compare the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among rural and urban support persons of haematological cancer survivors and explore factors associated with having one or more of these outcomes. Methods: Haematological cancer survivors were identified via 1 of 5 state‐based cancer registries and invited to take part in a survey. Those who agreed were asked to pass on a questionnaire package to their support person. Measures included the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, Support Persons' Unmet Need Survey, and sociodemographic questions. Results: Nine‐hundred and eighty‐nine (66%) participating survivors had a participating support person. There were no significant differences in the proportion of urban versus rural support persons who reported elevated levels of depression (21% vs 23%), anxiety (16% vs 17%), or stress (16% vs 20%), P > .05. Odds of reporting at least 1 indicator of psychological morbidity increased by 10% to 17% for each additional high or very high unmet need and by 2% for those who had relocated from their usual place of residence for the survivor to receive treatment and was decreased by 5% to 54% for those support persons who reported that they had no chronic health conditions. Conclusions: Psychological outcomes for rural and urban support persons are similar. Those who have poor health, have had to relocate, and who have multiple unmet needs are particularly vulnerable to poor psychological outcomes. These factors should be assessed to enable early intervention for those at risk of poor outcomes.

Journal Article,Perturbation-evoked potentials: Significance and application in balance control research.,"Historically, balance control was thought to be mediated solely by subcortical structures based on animal research. However, recent findings provide compelling evidence of cortical involvement during balance reactions evoked by whole-body postural perturbations. In humans, an external perturbation elicits an evoked potential, termed the perturbation-evoked potential (PEP). PEPs are widely distributed over fronto-centro-parietal areas with maximal amplitude at the FCz/Cz electrode. From our literature review it is evident that the PEPs are comprised of a small positive potential (P1) that peaks around 30–90ms after perturbation onset, a large negative potential (N1) that peaks around 90–160ms, followed by positive (P2) and negative (N2) potentials between 200 and 400ms. Converging results across multiple studies suggest that these different PEP components are influenced by perturbation characteristics, postural set, environmental, and psychological factors. This review summarizes and integrates seminal research on the PEP, with a special emphasis on the PEP N1. Implications for future studies in PEP research are discussed to encourage further empirical investigation of PEP characteristics in healthy and patient populations.

Journal Article,A systematic review of interventions to promote work participation in older workers.,"Purpose: The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at promoting work participation in older workers. Methods: We followed a systematic review process developed by the Institute for Work & Health and a best evidence synthesis that ranked evidence as strong, moderate, limited, or insufficient. Results: Seven electronic databases were searched from inception to March 2014. Evidence from 14 studies were synthesized in 4 different intervention categories: multi-component, exercise, medication and other interventions. There was moderate evidence that work participation was improved by multi-component interventions encompassing at least two of three components (health service delivery, coordination of services, and work modifications). There was not enough evidence to recommend the other interventions. Conclusions: Although there is a vast body of research on work participation of older workers, there are only a few high quality intervention studies aimed at improving work participation in this population. We recommend that multi-component interventions could be considered for implementation by practitioners to help improve work participation in older workers. Practical applications: With a moderate level of evidence, multi-component interventions could be considered for use in practice if practitioners deem it suitable for their setting. There is not enough evidence to recommend exercise interventions, pharmaceutical interventions, different types of surgeries, patient education or work accommodation alone to improve work participation. However, the lack of evidence should not be considered, as absence of effect and practitioners should continue to be creative in developing solutions.

Journal Article,Family members' helping behavior: Alliance formations during naturalistic polyadic conflicts.,"The present study investigated the role of alliances in naturalistic polyadic conflicts, which involved at least three family members, through a comparative analysis of parent–child‐ and sibling‐originated conflicts. Thirty‐nine families with two children (aged 4 and 6 years) were observed in the home setting. Transcripts of six 90‐min observational sessions per family resulted in identifying 306 polyadic family sequences; conflict initiators, topic, and resolution, as well as additional party roles (e.g., ally, judge, additional combatant, and mediator), were coded. Findings reveal that despite all family members being involved in polyadic conflicts, children tended to be initiators, while parents were more involved as additional parties. Alliances occurred more often than the other types of additional party roles. Alliance partnerships were most evident between mothers and fathers in parent–child‐originated conflicts, and mothers were more likely to ally with the younger child in sibling‐originated conflicts. Finally, submission was the most common resolution of polyadic conflicts; however, allies were more likely to win conflicts than to compromise or lose. This study highlights the dynamic nature of family conflict at home and is discussed in terms of links between relationships with family members, as well as informal learning of conflict behaviors. Highlights: 1. Conflicts involving three or more family members occurs quite often at home. 2. Alliances are a common role that family members assume in conflict, as they try to achieve a favourable outcome for their side. 3. Children's involvement both as initiators and additional parties highlight their learning of various complex conflict behaviours in childhood.

Journal Article,Children's enactment of characters' movements: A novel measure of spatial situation model representations and indicator of comprehension.,"A story's space or setting often determines and constrains the actions of its characters. We report on an experiment with 106 children of 7–8 years old in which, using a novel enactment task, we measured children's representation of a story character's movement during story listening. We found that children were more likely to enact movements that were explicitly stated in the passage than those they had to infer based on their situation model representation of the house and the character's location within it. We found that this ability to infer movements was significantly predictive of children's narrative comprehension after controlling for oral comprehension, vocabulary, working memory, and enactment of explicitly stated movements. We discuss the role of spatial situation models in comprehension and potential future uses for this enactment task in research and classrooms.

Journal Article,Compatibilism and incompatibilism in social cognition.,"Compatibilism is the view that determinism is compatible with acting freely and being morally responsible. Incompatibilism is the opposite view. It is often claimed that compatibilism or incompatibilism is a natural part of ordinary social cognition. That is, it is often claimed that patterns in our everyday social judgments reveal an implicit commitment to either compatibilism or incompatibilism. This paper reports five experiments designed to identify such patterns. The results support a nuanced hybrid account: The central tendencies in ordinary social cognition are compatibilism about moral responsibility, compatibilism about positive moral accountability (i.e., about deserving credit for good outcomes), neither compatibilism nor incompatibilism about negative moral accountability (i.e., about deserving blame for bad outcomes), compatibilism about choice for actions with positive outcomes, and incompatibilism about choice for actions with negative or neutral outcomes.

Journal Article,Best practice in provider/parent interaction.,"In this 3-year prospective grounded theory study in three pediatric settings, we aimed to develop a conceptualization of best practice health care providers (BPHCPs) in interaction with parents of children with complex, chronic, life-threatening conditions. Analysis of semistructured interviews with 34 parents and 80 health care professionals (HCPs) and 88 observation periods of HCP/parent interactions indicated that BPHCPs shared a broad worldview; values of equity, family-centered care, and integrity; and a commitment to authentic engagement. BPHCPs engaged in direct care activities, in connecting behaviors, and in exquisitely attuning to particularities of the situation in the moment, resulting in positive outcomes for parents and HCPs.

Journal Article,Examining the impact of a province-wide physical education policy on secondary students’ physical activity as a natural experiment.,"Background: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of a province-wide physical education (PE) policy on secondary school students’ moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Methods: Policy: In fall 2008, Manitoba expanded a policy requiring a PE credit for students in grades 11 and 12 for the first time in Canada. The PE curriculum requires grades 11 and 12 students to complete a minimum of 55 h (50% of course hours) of MVPA (e.g., ≥30 min/day of MVPA on ≥5 days a week) during a 5-month semester to achieve the course credit. Study Designs: A natural experimental study was designed using two sub-studies: 1) quasi-experimental controlled pre-post analysis of self-reported MVPA data obtained from census data in intervention and comparison [Prince Edward Island (PEI)] provinces in 2008 (n = 33,619 in Manitoba and n = 2258 in PEI) and 2012 (n = 41,169 in Manitoba and n = 4942 in PEI); and, 2) annual objectively measured MVPA in cohorts of secondary students in intervention (n = 447) and comparison (Alberta; n = 224) provinces over 4 years (2008 to 2012). Analysis: In Study 1, two logistic regressions were conducted to model the odds that students accumulated: i) ≥30 min/day of MVPA, and ii) met Canada's national recommendation of ≥60 min/day of MVPA, in Manitoba versus PEI after adjusting for grade, sex, and BMI. In Study 2, a mixed effects model was used to assess students’ minutes of MVPA per day per semester in Manitoba and Alberta, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, school location and school SES. Results: In Study 1, no significant differences were observed in students achieving ≥30 (OR:1.13, 95% CI:0.92, 1.39) or ≥60 min/day of MVPA (OR:0.92, 95% CI: 0.78, 1.07) from baseline to follow-up between Manitoba and PEI. In Study 2, no significant policy effect on students’ MVPA trajectories from baseline to last follow-up were observed between Manitoba and Alberta overall (−1.52, 95% CI:-3.47, 0.42), or by covariates. Conclusions: The Manitoba policy mandating PE in grades 11 and 12 had no effect on student MVPA overall or by key student or school characteristics. However, the effect of the PE policy may be underestimated due to the use of a nonrandomized research design and lack of data assessing the extent of policy implementation across schools. Nevertheless, findings can provide evidence about policy features that may improve the PE policy in Manitoba and inform future PE policies in other jurisdictions.

Journal Article,Do women have a choice? Care providers’ and decision makers’ perspectives on barriers to access of health services for birth after a previous cesarean.,"Background: Repeat cesarean delivery is the single largest contributor to the escalating cesarean rate worldwide. Approximately 80 percent of women with a past cesarean are candidates for vaginal birth after a cesarean (VBAC), but in Canada less than one-third plan VBAC. Emerging evidence suggests that these trends may be due in part to nonclinical factors, including care provider practice patterns and delays in access to surgical and anesthesia services. This study sought to explore maternity care providers’ and decision makers’ attitudes toward and experiences with providing and planning services for women with a previous cesarean. Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with family physicians, midwives, obstetricians, nurses, anesthetists, and health service decision makers recruited from three rural and two urban Canadian communities. Constructivist grounded theory informed iterative data collection and analysis. Results: Analysis of interviews (n = 35) revealed that the factors influencing decisions resulted from interactions between the clinical, organizational, and policy levels of the health care system. Physicians acted as information providers of clinical risks and benefits, with limited discussion of patient preferences. Decision makers serving large hospitals revealed concerns related to liability and patient safety. These stemmed from competing access to surgical resources. Conclusions: To facilitate women’s increased access to planned VBAC, it is necessary to address the barriers perceived by care providers and decision makers. Strategies to mitigate concerns include initiating decision support immediately after the primary cesarean, addressing the social risks that influence women’s preferences, and managing perceptions of patient and litigation risks through shared decision making.

Journal Article,Motor phenotype in neurodegenerative disorders: Gait and balance platform study design protocol for the Ontario Neurodegenerative Research Initiative (ONDRI).,"Background: The association of cognitive and motor impairments in Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases is thought to be related to damage in the common brain networks shared by cognitive and cortical motor control processes. These common brain networks play a pivotal role in selecting movements and postural synergies that meet an individual’s needs. Pathology in this “highest level” of motor control produces abnormalities of gait and posture referred to as highest-level gait disorders. Impairments in cognition and mobility, including falls, are present in almost all neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting common mechanisms that still need to be unraveled. Objective: To identify motor-cognitive profiles across neurodegenerative diseases in a large cohort of patients. Methods: Cohort study that includes up to 500 participants, followed every year for three years, across five neurodegenerative disease groups: Alzheimer’s disease/mild cognitive impairment, frontotemporal degeneration, vascular cognitive impairment, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease. Gait and balance will be assessed using accelerometers and electronic walkways, evaluated at different levels of cognitive and sensory complexity, using the dual-task paradigm. Results: Comparison of cognitive and motor performances across neurodegenerative groups will allow the identification of motor-cognitive phenotypes through the standardized evaluation of gait and balance characteristics. Conclusions: As part of the Ontario Neurodegenerative Research Initiative (ONDRI), the gait and balance platform aims to identify motor-cognitive profiles across neurodegenerative diseases. Gait assessment, particularly while dual-tasking, will help dissect the cognitive and motor contribution in mobility and cognitive decline, progression to dementia syndromes, and future adverse outcomes including falls and mortality.

Journal Article,How is sexual communication different from nonsexual communication? A moment-by-moment analysis of discussions between romantic partners.,"Our goal was to investigate whether systematic differences exist in how couples discuss sexual versus nonsexual conflicts in their relationships and to explore the nature of these differences. We compared sexual and nonsexual conflict discussions on two key dimensions of interpersonal behavior: warmth and dominance. Past theoretical work suggests that there are unique barriers to sexual communication that lead partners to perceive such communication as being more threatening to the relationship and to the self (Metts & Cupach, 1989). Empirical findings have supported this perspective by demonstrating that sexual communication tends to be avoided by couples (e.g., Byers, 2011). Extending this notion further, we reasoned that relationship partners should behave in ways to mitigate the increased perceived threat associated with sexual communication, leading to observable differences in how couples navigate sexual versus nonsexual relationship conflicts. We recruited a sample of 115 couples in established relationships and asked each couple to engage in two recorded interactions: one sexual and one nonsexual conflict discussion. Subsequently, each partner was coded continuously on the two dimensions of warmth and dominance. We found a number of differences in how couples discussed sexual versus nonsexual conflicts. Further, couples reported higher levels of anxiety in advance of sexual, as compared to nonsexual, conflict discussions. However, anxiety did not mediate the observed differences in communication. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

Journal Article,Shy individuals’ interpretations of counterfactual verbal irony.,"Counterfactual verbal irony, an evaluative form of figurative language wherein a speaker’s intended meaning is opposite to the literal meaning of his or her words, is used to serve many social goals. Despite recent calls for theoretical accounts to include the factors that influence irony interpretation, few studies have examined the individual differences that may impact verbal irony interpretation. The present study examined whether adults with elevated shyness would generate more negative interpretations of ironic statements. University students with varying degrees of shyness listened to stories (accompanied by comics) wherein one character made literal or ironic criticisms or compliments to another character. Participants then appraised each speaker’s belief and attitude. Self-reported shyness did not predict comprehension of the counterfactual nature of ironic statements. However, shyer adults rated speakers who made ironic compliments as being meaner than did adults low in shyness. Thus, while understanding that ironic speakers intended to communicate their true beliefs, shyer individuals construed the social meaning of irony more negatively. Such interpretive biases may lead shy individuals to more frequently take offense at ironic compliments and experience more negativity in social interactions.

Journal Article,Intuitive probabilistic inference in capuchin monkeys.,"The ability to reason about probabilities has ecological relevance for many species. Recent research has shown that both preverbal infants and non-human great apes can make predictions about single-item samples randomly drawn from populations by reasoning about proportions. To further explore the evolutionary origins of this ability, we conducted the first investigation of probabilistic inference in a monkey species (capuchins; Sapajus spp.). Across four experiments, capuchins (N = 19) were presented with two populations of food items that differed in their relative distribution of preferred and non-preferred items, such that one population was more likely to yield a preferred item. In each trial, capuchins had to select between hidden single-item samples randomly drawn from each population. In Experiment 1 each population was homogeneous so reasoning about proportions was not required; Experiments 2–3 replicated previous probabilistic reasoning research with infants and apes; and Experiment 4 was a novel condition untested in other species, providing an important extension to previous work. Results revealed that at least some capuchins were able to make probabilistic inferences via reasoning about proportions as opposed to simpler quantity heuristics. Performance was relatively poor in Experiment 4, so the possibility remains that capuchins may use quantity-based heuristics in some situations, though further work is required to confirm this. Interestingly, performance was not at ceiling in Experiment 1, which did not involve reasoning about proportions, but did involve sampling. This suggests that the sampling task posed demands in addition to reasoning about proportions, possibly related to inhibitory control, working memory, and/or knowledge of object permanence.

Journal Article,The environmental production of disability for seniors with age-related vision loss.,"To date, attention to the environmental production of disability among older adults with age-related vision loss (ARVL) has been limited. This critical ethnographic study aimed to reveal the ways in which environmental barriers produced and perpetuated disability for 10 older adults with ARVL. A modified version of Carspecken’s five-stage approach for critical ethnography was adopted with three methods of data collection used, including a narrative interview, a participant observation session, and a semi-structured, in-depth interview. Findings revealed how disability is shaped for older adults with ARVL when they encounter environmental features that are embedded within an ageist and disablist society. These findings are illustrated via presenting analysis of three commonly discussed activities: shopping, eating, and community mobility. Our discussion suggests that addressing the environmental production of disability requires inclusive social policy, advocacy, and a focus on education in order to develop and sustain age and low-vision friendly environments.

Journal Article,Hierarchical task network planning with resources and temporal constraints.,"Planning problems in many real-world areas are characterized by the involvement of various types of resources and complex temporal and functional relationships among numerous tasks. Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is suitable for large-scale practical planning problems due to its hierarchical task decomposition principle and expressiveness for domain knowledge representation. In this paper, we propose an HTN planning algorithm named GSCCB-SHOP2 to handle multi-capacity discrete resources and complex temporal constraints simultaneously during planning. The algorithm integrates three carefully designed and interrelated sub-modules. First, the Resource model realizes resource reasoning with the designed state updating rules. Second, the Check Consistency and Backtrack (CCB) module is designed to determine temporal constraints and maintain the consistency of those constraints. Third, the Guide Search (GS) module is designed to improve the resource utilization and thus shorten the makespan performance of the generated action plan. Experimental studies are conducted to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

Journal Article,Who can't take a compliment? The role of construal level and self-esteem in accepting positive feedback from close others.,"One way that relationship partners express positive regard—a key variable in relationship success—is through compliments. However, some people are unable to perceive positive regard through compliments. We hypothesized that low self-esteem (LSE) individuals' relatively negative self-theories conflict with the positive information conveyed in compliments. Hence, LSEs' self-verification motives (e.g., Swann, 1997, 2012) may lead LSEs to reject the positive implications of compliments. In an initial study, we demonstrated that LSEs (vs. high self-esteem individuals; HSEs) feel greater self-related concerns and negative affect after receiving compliments, which leads them to devalue those compliments. Drawing on theories of mental construal (e.g., Libby, Valenti, Pfent, & Eibach, 2011), we reasoned that the remedy for such self-theory-driven processes is to adopt a concrete (vs. abstract) mindset: LSEs should be less likely to apply their relatively negative self-theories when they process compliments in a concrete mindset. Across three studies, we used diverse methods to induce participants to experience either a concrete or abstract mindset, and asked them to recall (Studies 2 and 3) or imagine (Study 4) a partner's compliment. We then assessed their perceptions of their partners' regard. Results confirmed that the discrepancy in LSEs' and HSEs' perceptions of positive regard following a compliment from their romantic partners was significantly reduced when a concrete mindset was induced compared to when an abstract mindset (or no mindset, Study 4) was induced.

Journal Article,Read my lips: Visual speech influences word processing in infants.,"What do infants hear when they read lips? In the present study, twelve-to-thirteen-month-old infants viewed a talking face produce familiar and unfamiliar words. The familiar words were of three types: in Experiment 1, they were produced correctly (e.g., “bottle”); in Experiment 2, infants saw and heard mispronunciations in which the altered phoneme either visually resembled the original phoneme (visually consistent, e.g. “pottle”), or did not visually resemble the original phoneme (visually inconsistent, e.g., “dottle”). Infants in the correct and consistent conditions differentiated the familiar and unfamiliar words, but infants in the inconsistent condition did not. Experiment 3 confirms that infants were sensitive to the mispronunciations in the consistent condition with auditory-only words. Thus, although infants recognized the consistent mispronunciations when they saw a face articulating the words, they did not with the auditory information alone. These results provide the first evidence that visual articulatory information affects word processing in infants.

These lower force levels, which are relevant to the development of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, are usually not the focus of fatigue studies. In studies that did measure fatigue in light manual or precision work, within and between measurement responses were inconsistent. The aim of this study was to identify fatigue measures that were responsive at lower force levels (<10% MVC) over the course of an 8-h period. A complementary set of fatigue measures, reflecting both neuromuscular and cognitive mechanisms, was measured during a light precision micro-pipetting task performed by 11 participants. Nine measures were found to be significantly responsive over the 8-h period, including: ratings of perceived fatigue, postural tremor, blink frequency and critical flicker fusion frequency threshold. Common field measures, specifically electromyography RMS amplitude and maximum voluntary contractions, did not lead to extraordinary time effects.

Journal Article,"Evaluating the ergonomic benefit of a wrist brace on wrist posture, muscle activity, rotational stiffness, and peak shovel-ground impact force during a simulated tree-planting task.","Background: Tree planters are at a high risk for wrist injury due to awkward postures and high wrist loads experienced during each planting cycle, specifically at shovel-ground impact. Wrist joint stiffness provides a measure that integrates postural and loading information. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate wrist joint stiffness requirements at the instant of shovel-ground impact during tree planting and determine if a wrist brace could alter muscular contributions to wrist joint stiffness. Method: Planters simulated tree planting with and without wearing a brace on their planting arm. Surface electromyography (sEMG) from six forearm muscles and wrist kinematics were collected and used to calculate muscular contributions to joint rotational stiffness about the wrist. Results: Wrist joint stiffness increased with brace use, an unanticipated and negative consequence of wearing a brace. As a potential benefit, planters achieved a more neutrally oriented wrist angle about the flexion/extension axis, although a less neutral wrist angle about the ulnar/radial axis was observed. Muscle activity did not change between conditions. Conclusion: The joint stiffness analysis, combining kinematic and sEMG information in a biologically relevant manner, revealed clear limitations with the interface between the brace grip and shovel handle that jeopardized the prophylactic benefits of the current brace design. This limitation was not as evident when considering kinematics and sEMG data independently. Application: A neuromechanical model (joint rotational stiffness) enhanced our ability to evaluate the brace design relative to kinematic and sEMG parameter-based metrics alone.

Encyclopedia Entry,Emotional development.,"Emotion plays a central role in historical and current models of child development. From birth, expressing emotions and perceiving the emotions of others provide the foundation for communication and therefore serve adaptive social and evolutionary functions. Given the central role of emotion in communication, social interaction, and our understanding of developmental risk and resilience, the study of emotion in infants, children, and adolescents is by definition an interdisciplinary endeavor. The study of emotion requires research designs and interpretations that are sensitive to normative developmental changes in emotion experience and expression, emotion understanding, and contextual influences on emotion. For example, over the course of development, emotions become increasingly complex (e.g., the emergence of self-conscious emotions), expressions can be associated from feeling states (e.g., display rules), and contexts change in their emotional salience (e.g., increased peer-group influences in adolescence). In the following sections, we review normative developmental changes that influence the understanding and experience of emotion from infancy through adolescence. Within each of three age periods (infancy, childhood, adolescence), we discuss the changing nature and functional significance of emotions and the implications of these changes for assessment. We conclude with ideas regarding future directions in the interdisciplinary study of emotional development.

Results: The higher‐order factor structure of the QOLCE‐55 demonstrated adequate fit: Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.948; Tucker‐Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.946; Root Mean Square of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.060 (90% confidence interval [CI] 0.054–0.065); Weighted Root Mean Square Residuals (WRMR) = 1.247. Higher‐order factor loadings were strong, ranging from λ = 0.74 to 0.81. Internal consistency reliability was excellent (α = 0.97, subscales α > 0.82). QOLCE‐55 subscales demonstrated moderate to strong correlations with similar subscales of the KIDSCREEN‐27 (ρ = 0.43–0.75) and weak to moderate correlations with dissimilar subscales (ρ = 0.25–0.42). The QOLCE‐55 demonstrated partial measurement equivalence at the level of strict invariance—χ2 (2,823) = 3,727.9, CFI = 0.961, TLI = 0.962, RMSEA = 0.049 (0.044, 0.053), WRMR = 1.834. Significance: The findings provide support for the factor structure of the QOLCE‐55 and contribute to its robust psychometric profile as a reliable and valid measure. Researchers and health practitioners should consider the QOLCE‐55 as a viable option for reducing respondent burden when assessing health‐related quality of life in children with epilepsy.

Journal Article,Use and perceptions of caffeinated energy drinks and energy shots in Canada.,"Introduction: In Canada, energy drinks and energy shots are currently classified and regulated differently (food and drugs versus natural health products, respectively), on the assumption that they are used and perceived differently. The current study examined potential differences in use and perceptions of energy drinks and shots. Methods: An online survey was conducted in 2015 using a national commercial online panel of youth and young adults aged 12–24 years (n = 2,040 retained for analysis in 2016). Participants were randomized to view an image of an energy shot or drink, and were asked about 14 potential reasons for using the product. Past consumption of each product was also assessed. Chi-square and t-tests were conducted to examine differences in use and perceptions between products. Results: Overall, 15.6% of respondents reported using both energy shots and drinks. Of all respondents, < 1% had tried only energy shots, whereas 58.0% had tried only energy drinks. For each product, the most commonly reported reasons for use were “to stay awake” and “to increase concentration or alertness.” Out of 14 potential reasons for use, respondents were significantly more likely to endorse seven of the reasons for energy drinks rather than shots; however, the magnitude of these differences was modest and the ordering of the reasons for use of each product was comparable. Conclusions: Despite differences in prevalence of ever-use of energy shots and drinks, consumption patterns and perceived reasons for using the products are similar. The findings provide little support for regulating energy shots differently than energy drinks.

Journal Article,Group‐based compassion‐focused therapy as an adjunct to outpatient treatment for eating disorders: A pilot randomized controlled trial.,"The current study sought to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a compassion-focused therapy (CFT) group as an adjunct to evidence-based outpatient treatment for eating disorders, and to examine its preliminary efficacy relative to treatment as usual (TAU). Twenty-two outpatients with various types of eating disorders were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of TAU (n = 11) or TAU plus weekly CFT groups adapted for an eating disorder population (CFT +TAU; n = 11). Participants in both conditions completed measures of self-compassion, fears of compassion, shame and eating disorder pathology at baseline, week 4, week 8 and week 12. Additionally, participants receiving the CFT group completed measures assessing acceptability and feasibility of the group. Results indicated that the CFT group demonstrated strong acceptability; attendance was high and the group retained over 80% of participants. Participants rated the group positively and indicated they would be very likely to recommend it to peers with similar symptoms. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that compared to the TAU condition, the CFT +TAU condition yielded greater improvements in self-compassion, fears of self-compassion, fears of receiving compassion, shame and eating disorder pathology over the 12 weeks. Results suggest that group-based CFT, offered in conjunction with evidence-based outpatient TAU for eating disorders, may be an acceptable, feasible and efficacious intervention. Furthermore, eating disorder patients appear to see benefit in, and observe gains from, working on the CFT goals of overcoming fears of compassion, developing more self-compassion and accessing more compassion from others.

Journal Article,"The impact of office chair features on lumbar lordosis, intervertebral joint and sacral tilt angles: A radiographic assessment.","Background: The purpose of this study was to determine which office chair feature is better at improving spine posture in sitting. Method: Participants (n = 28) were radiographed in standing, maximum flexion and seated in four chair conditions: control, lumbar support, seat pan tilt and backrest with scapular relief. Measures of lumbar lordosis, intervertebral joint angles and sacral tilt were compared between conditions and sex. Results: Sitting consisted of approximately 70% of maximum range of spine flexion. No differences in lumbar flexion were found between the chair features or control. Significantly more anterior pelvic rotation was found with the lumbar support (p = 0.0028) and seat pan tilt (p p < 0.0001). Conclusion: No one feature was statistically superior with respect to minimising spine flexion, however, seat pan tilt resulted in significantly improved pelvic posture.

Journal Article,Leveraging finger identification to integrate multi-touch command selection and parameter manipulation.,"Identifying which fingers are touching a multi-touch surface provides a very large input space. We describe FingerCuts, an interaction technique inspired by desktop keyboard shortcuts to exploit this potential. FingerCuts enables integrated command selection and parameter manipulation, it uses feed-forward and feedback to increase discoverability, it is backward compatible with current touch input techniques, and it is adaptable for different touch device form factors. We implemented three variations of FingerCuts, each tailored to a different device form factor: tabletop, tablet, and smartphone. Qualitative and quantitative studies conducted on the tabletop suggests that with some practice, FingerCuts is expressive, easy-to-use, and increases a sense of continuous interaction flow and that interaction with FingerCuts is as fast, or faster than using a graphical user interface. A theoretical analysis of FingerCuts using the Fingerstroke-Level Model (FLM) matches our quantitative study results, justifying our use of FLM to analyse and validate the performance for the other device form factors.

Journal Article,"The associations between e-cigarettes and binge drinking, marijuana use, and energy drinks mixed with alcohol.","Purpose: Use of e-cigarettes by youth is proliferating worldwide, but little is known about the behavioral profile of youth e-cigarette users and the association of e-cigarette use with other health-risky behaviors. This study examines the associations between e-cigarette use and tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol use among a large sample of Canadian youth. Methods: Using Canadian data from 39,837 grade 9 to 12 students who participated in year 3 (2014–2015) of the COMPASS study, logistic regression models were used to examine how current use of e-cigarettes were associated with tobacco, marijuana, binge drinking, and energy drinks mixed with alcohol. Pearson's chi-square tests were used to examine subgroup differences by sex. Results: Overall, 9.75% of respondents were current e-cigarette users. Current cigarette smokers (odds ratio [OR] = 3.009), current marijuana users (OR = 5.549), and noncurrent marijuana users (OR = 3.653) were more likely to report using e-cigarettes than noncigarette smokers and nonmarijuana users. Gender differences among males and females showed higher risk of e-cigarette use among female current marijuana users (OR = 7.029) relative to males (OR = 4.931) and female current smokers (OR = 3.284) compared to males (OR = 2.862). Compared to nonbinge drinkers, weekly (OR = 3.253), monthly (OR = 3.113), and occasional (OR = 2.333) binge drinkers were more likely to use e-cigarettes. Similarly, students who consume energy drinks mixed with alcohol (OR = 1.650) were more likely to use e-cigarettes compared to students who do not consume them. Conclusions: We identify that youth who binge drink or use marijuana have a greater increased risk for using e-cigarettes compared to cigarette smokers. These data suggest that efforts to prevent e-cigarette use should not only be discussed in the domain of tobacco control.

Journal Article,Using learning environments to create meaningful work for co-op students.,"For students in cooperative education (co-op) programs, meaningful work is a critical aspect of participation and a key component of program success. However, studies have not explored how meaningful work can be created for co-op students. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between co-op students’ perceptions of a learning environment, perceived relatedness of the work experience (to their potential careers and to their academic studies), and self-reported meaningfulness of work. Data were collected from undergraduate co-op students in a Canadian university immediately following a co-op work term. Results from testing a parallel mediation model showed that both forms of relatedness partially mediated the influence of learning environments on self-reported meaningfulness. These findings offer insight into the ways in which work terms can be designed to enhance co-op students’ work experiences.

Journal Article,Identifying the critical physical demanding tasks of paramedic work: Towards the development of a physical employment standard.,"Public safety related occupations including police, fire and military commonly apply physical employment standard (PES) to facilitate job matching, an approach to evaluate if candidates demonstrate acceptable physical capabilities as required to perform the job safely and effectively. In Canada, paramedics remain as one of the few public safety occupations without an evidence-based, validated PES. The purpose of this study was to document and describe the physical demands of paramedic work and to identify the most physically demanding tasks. These outcomes are essential to inform the design and development of an evidence-based PES for the paramedic sector. Physical demands of paramedic work were documented and described using a direct observation-based task analysis technique. Five paramedic's were trained to document the physical demands of their work, then applied their training to observe more than 90 calls over the course of 20 full 12-h work shifts. Physical demands data were then listed in a survey, administered service-wide, where 155 frontline paramedics identified critically demanding tasks and rank-ordered physical demands from not physically demanding to very strongly demanding. Critically important and physically demanding tasks were identified such as: transferring a patient; loading or unloading a stretcher in to or out of the ambulance; performing CPR; and, raising and lowering a stretcher. It is important that a paramedic-based PES evaluate a candidate's physical capabilities to perform the critical and physically demanding tasks identified in this study.

Journal Article,The relationship between perceived underemployment and wellbeing: Evidence from mid-size Canadian cities.,"This study examines the association between underemployment and quality of life, with a focus the explanatory power of community and leisure factors. Using survey data collected by the Canadian Index of Wellbeing in four mid-size communities (N = 5561), a subsample of participants was selected who indicated that they worked for pay (n = 2845). About one-fifth of workers were underemployed, based on a perceived mismatch between their job and their education and training. Guided by a modified perspective of the Leisure Constraints Model that includes intrapersonal, interpersonal, and structural level constraints and/or facilitators to participation, data were analyzed using two linear regression models examining overall wellbeing and self-assessed mental health. After controlling for socio-demographic characteristics in each model, mediators were introduced and then further probed to determine significant pathways in the relationships. In both cases, the direct effect of underemployment was negative. Wellbeing among underemployed workers was partially mediated by two structural, and one interpersonal factors: time for self, perceived access to recreation and cultural opportunities, and sense of community. Mental health was fully mediated by time for self and sense of community. In a test of contrast between significant pathways, there were no differences in either model, suggesting that each of the significant leisure moderators contributed equally to the relationship between underemployment and quality of life. Community and leisure factors have been relatively unexamined to date, but results show that they should be considered for inclusion in future research on personal outcomes of underemployment.

Erratum/Correction,'When gift-giving produces dissonance: Effects of subliminal affiliation priming on choices for one's self versus close others': Corrigendum.,"Reports an error in 'When gift-giving produces dissonance: Effects of subliminal affiliation priming on choices for one's self versus close others' by Sasha Y. Kimel, Igor Grossmann and Shinobu Kitayama (Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 2012[Sep], Vol 48[5], 1221-1224). In the original article, there was an error in the F-value in Study 3 on page 1223. This should have been F=4.22 (i.e., F(1, 66)=4.22, p 2012-15151-001). Past research on cognitive dissonance indicated that people from independent (e.g. European-American) and interdependent (e.g. East-Asian) cultural backgrounds show different patterns of choice justification: whereas choice made for oneself affirms the independent view of the self, choice made for close others affirms the interdependent view of the self. We hypothesized that interpersonal choice considerations may be temporally accessible even among habitually independent European-Americans. The present research provides the first experimental evidence that choice justification varies as a function of both subliminal affiliation priming and the target of choice (self vs. close others). Results from three studies indicate that subliminal priming of affiliation increases justification of a choice European-Americans made for a close other, while decreasing justification of a choice made for the self. Implications for theories related to cognitive dissonance, subliminal processing and cultural meaning systems are discussed.

Journal Article,Group decision methodology to support watershed committees in choosing among combinations of alternatives.,"A group decision-making methodology is proposed that permits each member of a group to state his or her preferences with respect to combinations of alternative solutions to a problem during a collective process to arrive at a compromise via a special voting procedure. The possible combinations of alternatives are systematically generated using an option form approach. Decision-makers (DMs) individually rank combinations based on their preferences by providing ordinal information in an interactive way, reducing the cognitive burden of making many comparisons or defining tradeoffs. In this approach, each DM expresses his or her preferences using logical preference statements regarding combinations of alternatives. A group recommendation is obtained after aggregating the final individual ranks through a voting procedure, and a voting support system, based on classification by quartiles. The voting procedure is simple and transparent for voters and does not present severe computational difficulties, thereby making this approach an appropriate tool for employment in the context of group-decision making. To illustrate its applicability, the proposed methodology is applied to a realistic decision problem faced by a watershed committee in Brazil.

Journal Article,Children’s judgments about ownership rights and body rights: Evidence for a common basis.,"We report two experiments supporting the theory that children’s understanding of ownership rights is related to their notions of body rights. Experiment 1 investigated 4- to 7-year-olds’ (N = 123) developing sensitivity to physical contact in their judgments about the acceptability of behaving in relation to owned objects and body parts. Experiment 2 used a simpler design to investigate this in 3- and 4-year-olds (N = 112). Findings confirmed two predictions of the theory. First, in both experiments, children’s judgments about ownership and body rights were similarly affected by physical contact. Second, judgments about both kinds of rights were yoked in development; age-related changes in judgments about ownership rights were paralleled by changes in judgments about body rights. Our findings have additional import for theories of ownership rights because they suggest that physical contact may be a crucial factor in whether behaviors targeting property are judged to be permissible.

Journal Article,Isolating automatic photism generation from strategic photism use in grapheme-colour synaesthesia.,"Grapheme-colour synaesthesia is a phenomenon in which ordinary black numbers and letters (graphemes) trigger the experience of highly specific colours (photisms). The Synaesthetic Stroop task has been used to demonstrate that graphemes trigger photisms automatically. In the standard Stroop task, congruent trial probability (CTP) has been manipulated to isolate effects of automaticity from higher-order strategic effects, with larger Stroop effects at high CTP attributed to participants strategically attending to the stimulus word to facilitate responding, and smaller Stroop effects at low CTP reflecting automatic word processing. Here we apply this logic for the first time to the Synaesthetic Stroop task. At high CTP we showed larger Stroop effects due to synaesthetes using their synaesthetic colours strategically. At low CTP Stroop effects were reduced but were still significant. We directly isolate automatic processing of graphemes from strategic effects and conclusively show that, in synaesthesia, viewing black graphemes automatically triggers colour experiences.

Journal Article,When wanting the best goes right or wrong: Distinguishing between adaptive and maladaptive maximization.,"Researchers have often disagreed on how to define maximization, leading to conflicting conclusions about its potential benefits or drawbacks. Drawing from motivation research, we distinguish between the goals (i.e., wanting the best) and strategies (e.g., alternative search) associated with maximizing. Three studies illustrate how this differentiation offers insight into when maximizers do or do not experience affective costs when making decisions. In Study 1, we show that two motivational orientations, promotion focus and assessment mode, are both associated with the goal of wanting the best, yet assessment (not promotion) is related to the use of alternative search strategies. In Study 2, we demonstrate that alternative search strategies are associated with frustration on a discrete decision task. In Study 3, we provide evidence that one reason for this link may be due to reconsideration of previously dismissed options. We discuss the potential of this approach to integrate research in this area.

Journal Article,The rest of the story: A qualitative study of complementing standardized assessment data with informal interviews with older patients and families.,"Background: While standardized health assessments capture valuable information on patients’ demographic and diagnostic characteristics, health conditions, and physical and mental functioning, they may not capture information of most relevance to individual patients and their families. Given that patients and their informal caregivers are the experts on that patient’s unique context, it is important to ensure they are able to convey all relevant personal information to formal healthcare providers so that high-quality, patient-centered care may be delivered. This study aims to identify information that older patients and families consider important but that might not be included in standardized assessments. Methods: Transcripts were analyzed from 29 interviews relating to eight patients with hip fractures from three sites (large urban, smaller urban, rural) in two provinces in Canada. These interviews were conducted as part of a larger ethnographic study. Each transcript was analyzed by two researchers using content analysis. Results were reviewed in two focus group interviews with older adults and family caregivers. Identified themes were compared with items from two standardized assessments used in healthcare settings. Results: Three broad themes emerged from the qualitative analysis that were not covered in the standardized assessments: informal caregiver and family considerations, insider healthcare knowledge, and patients’ healthcare attitudes and experiences. The importance of these themes was confirmed through focus group interviews. Focus group participants also emphasized the importance of conducting assessments in a patient-centered way and the importance of open-ended questions. Conclusions: A less structured interview approach may yield information that would otherwise be missed in standardized assessments. Combining both sources could yield better-informed healthcare planning and quality-improvement efforts.

In this model, the loss of information over time results from changes in the spiking neural activity through recurrent connections. We reproduce the standard forgetting curve and then show that this curve changes in the presence of GFC and PHE, whose application is simulated by manipulating functional, neural, and biophysical properties of the model. In particular, applying GFC causes increased activity in neurons that are sensitive to the information currently being remembered, while applying PHE leads to decreased activity in these same neurons. Interestingly, these differential effects emerge from network-level interactions because GFC and PHE affect all neurons equally. We compare our model to both electrophysiological data from neurons in monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and to behavioral evidence from monkeys performing the DRT.

Journal Article,"A cohort study examining emergency department visits and hospital admissions among people who use drugs in Ottawa, Canada.","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 14[42] of Harm Reduction Journal (see record 2017-29435-001). In the original article, an error occurred at the beginning of the Methods section. The correction is present in the erratum.] Background: The health of people who use drugs (PWUD) is characterized by multimorbidity and chronicity of health conditions, necessitating an understanding of their health care utilization. The objective of this study was to evaluate emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions among a cohort of PWUD. Methods: We used a retrospective observational design between 2012 and 2013. The population was a marginalized cohort of PWUD (the PROUD study) for whom survey data was linked (n = 663) to provincial health administrative data housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. We constructed a 5:1 comparison group matched by age, sex, income quintile, and region. The main outcomes were defined as having two or more ED visits, or one or more hospital admissions, in the year prior to survey completion. We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with these outcomes. Results: Compared to the matched cohort, PWUD had higher rates of ED visits (rate ratio [RR] 7.0; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 6.5–7.6) and hospitalization (RR 7.7; 95% CI 5.9–10.0). After adjustment, factors predicting more ED visits were receiving disability (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.0; 95% CI 1.7–5.5) or income assistance (AOR 2.7; 95% CI 1.5–5.0), injection drug use (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.3–3.4), incarceration within 12 months (AOR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1–2.4), mental health comorbidity (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.4–3.1), and a suicide attempt within 12 months (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.1–3.4). Receiving methadone (AOR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3–0.9) and having a regular family physician (AOR 0.5; 95% CI 0.2–0.9) were associated with lower odds of having more ED visits. Factors associated with more hospital admissions included Aboriginal identity (AOR 2.4; 95% CI 1.4–4.1), receiving disability (AOR 2.4; 95% CI 1.1–5.4), non-injection drug use (opioids and non-opioids) (AOR 2.2; 95% CI 1.1–4.4), comorbid HIV (AOR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2–5.6), mental health comorbidity (AOR 2.4; 95% CI 1.3–4.2), and unstable housing (AOR 1.9; 95% CI 1.0–3.4); there were no protective factors for hospitalization. Conclusions: Improved post-incarceration support, housing services, and access to integrated primary care services including opioid replacement therapy may be effective interventions to decrease acute care use among PWUD, including targeted approaches for people receiving social assistance or with mental health concerns.

Journal Article,"Knowing where is different from knowing what: Distinct response time profiles and accuracy effects for target location, orientation, and color probability.","When a location is cued, targets appearing at that location are detected more quickly. When a target feature is cued, targets bearing that feature are detected more quickly. These attentional cueing effects are only superficially similar. More detailed analyses find distinct temporal and accuracy profiles for the two different types of cues. This pattern parallels work with probability manipulations, where both feature and spatial probability are known to affect detection accuracy and reaction times. However, little has been done by way of comparing these effects. Are probability manipulations on space and features distinct? In a series of five experiments, we systematically varied spatial probability and feature probability along two dimensions (orientation or color). In addition, we decomposed response times into initiation and movement components. Targets appearing at the probable location were reported more quickly and more accurately regardless of whether the report was based on orientation or color. On the other hand, when either color probability or orientation probability was manipulated, response time and accuracy improvements were specific for that probable feature dimension. Decomposition of the response time benefits demonstrated that spatial probability only affected initiation times, whereas manipulations of feature probability affected both initiation and movement times. As detection was made more difficult, the two effects further diverged, with spatial probability disproportionally affecting initiation times and feature probability disproportionately affecting accuracy. In conclusion, all manipulations of probability, whether spatial or featural, affect detection. However, only feature probability affects perceptual precision, and precision effects are specific to the probable attribute.

Journal Article,"Clinical, sociobiological, and cognitive predictors of ADHD persistence in children followed prospectively over time.","With increasing awareness that ADHD is chronically disabling, a burgeoning literature has examined childhood clinical indicators of ADHD persistence. This study investigates whether childhood factors reflecting biological risk and cognitive reserve have additive predictive value for the persistence of ADHD that is unique beyond childhood indicators of disorder severity. One-hundred thirty children with ADHD (mean age = 8.9 years, 75 % male) were followed into adolescence (mean age = 14.0 years). Childhood ADHD and co-morbidities were assessed via interviews with parents and teachers; parental psychopathology was assessed via parent interview; exposure to neurobiological and psychosocial adversity were indexed by parent questionnaire; and cognitive reserve was evaluated through children’s performance on measures of IQ and executive functioning. Univariate analyses identified childhood inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, co-morbid oppositional defiant disorder, overall impairment, and paternal anxiety and depression as more prevalent amongst adolescents with persistent compared with remitted ADHD. Only child-level predictors remained significant in a final multivariate model. These results suggest that children who are most likely to experience persistent ADHD have a more severe clinical presentation in childhood, reflected by increased levels of inattention, oppositional behavior, and impairment. They also are more likely to have fathers with internalizing concerns, but these concerns do not uniquely predict ADHD persistence beyond child-level factors. Contrary to expectations, childhood adversity and cognitive functioning did not predict the course of ADHD.

Journal Article,Knowledge central: A central role for knowledge attributions in social evaluations.,"Five experiments (N = 1710) demonstrate the central role of knowledge attributions in social evaluations. In Experiments 1–3, we manipulated whether an agent believes, is certain of, or knows a true proposition and asked people to rate whether the agent should perform a variety of actions. We found that knowledge, more so than belief or certainty, leads people to judge that the agent should act. In Experiments 4–5, we investigated whether attributions of knowledge or certainty can explain an important finding on how people act based on statistical evidence, known as “the Wells effect”. We found that knowledge attributions, but not certainty attributions, mediate this effect on decision making.

Journal Article,Post-event processing in social anxiety disorder: Examining the mediating roles of positive metacognitive beliefs and perceptions of performance.,"Background: Post-event processing (PEP) is defined as repetitive negative thinking following anxiety provoking social events. PEP is thought to maintain anxiety symptoms in Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) but little is known about the specific factors that contribute to the maintenance of PEP. Aims: The current study investigated how perceptions of performance and positive metacognitive beliefs might contribute to the persistence of PEP. Method: Participants with SAD (n = 24) as well as anxious (n = 24) and healthy (n = 25) control participants completed a standardized social performance task in the lab. Their engagement in PEP and perceptions of performance were assessed in the week that followed. Results: Immediately following the social task, individuals with SAD rated their performance more negatively and endorsed a greater number of positive metacognitive beliefs about PEP than did participants in both control groups. Importantly, both metacognitive beliefs and initial negative self-ratings of performance mediated the relationship between group status and PEP in the days following the event. Conclusions: These results are consistent with cognitive and metacognitive models of SAD and enhance our understanding of the cognitive processes which may function to initiate and maintain negative thinking patterns in SAD.

Journal Article,Recognizing ethical issues: An examination of practicing industry accountants and accounting students.,"It has long been recognized that accountants practicing in business settings have a dual role: (1) as employees, they are bound to the organization, and (2) as professionals, they are bound by the profession’s code of ethical conduct (Westra, Journal of Business Ethics 5(2): 119–128, 1986). These two roles highlight the need to recognize and consider both the ethical and economic implications of their decisions. Practicing industry accountants are commonly involved in a broad range of their firm’s business practices and decision making, and are increasingly exposed to the commercial aspects of their companies. Also, during their education, they were trained on their professional responsibilities. However, in general, this education was not recent and may not have been reinforced. By contrast, accounting students have been recently and repeatedly exposed to and have knowledge about their professional responsibilities as an accountant, but limited, if any, exposure to the commercial aspects of business. Consequently, our first hypothesis predicts that the ethical sensitivity of practicing industry accountants will be lower than that of accounting students. We find limited support for this hypothesis. Second, we also examine company reward structure and predict that ethical sensitivity will be lower for those in a company with a reward structure narrowly focused only on financial goals as compared to those in a company with a broad reward structure (e.g., including rewards for both financial and non-financial goals). Third, we predict that the difference in ethical sensitivity levels between those in a company with a narrow reward structure as compared to those in a company with a broad financial reward structure will be higher for practicing industry accountants compared to accounting students. Results from our study generally support these last two predictions. Ethical sensitivity is lower for those in a company with a reward structure narrowly focused only on financial goals as compared to those in a company with a broad reward structure, suggesting that companies may be able to increase ethical awareness in their organizations by including non-financial goals in their reward structures.

Journal Article,An empirical model of activity in macaque inferior temporal cortex.,"There are compelling computational models of many properties of the primate ventral visual stream, but a gap remains between the models and the physiology. To facilitate ongoing refinement of these models, we have compiled diverse information from the electrophysiology literature into a statistical model of inferotemporal (IT) cortex responses. This is a purely descriptive model, so it has little explanatory power. However it is able to directly incorporate a rich and extensible set of tuning properties. So far, we have approximated tuning curves and statistics of tuning diversity for occlusion, clutter, size, orientation, position, and object selectivity in early versus late response phases. We integrated the model with the VREP simulator, which provides stimulus properties in a simulated physical environment. In contrast with the empirical model presented here, mechanistic models are ultimately more useful for understanding neural systems. However, a detailed empirical model may be useful as a source of labeled data for optimizing and validating mechanistic models, or as a source of input to models of other brain areas.

Journal Article,Improving the police complaints system: Stakeholder collaboration as a vehicle for systems change.,"Systems change efforts seek to alter the status quo by shifting the form and function of a targeted system. Evaluation is a critical component, yet little research has examined a collaborative forum as a vehicle for change in the criminal justice system. Over 150 citizens and police were brought together to work collaboratively at improving a Canadian police complaints system. Using survey, participant observation, and focus group data, this study investigates the perceptions of this Forum as a vehicle for systems change in police oversight mechanisms. We find the Forum provided both opportunities for, and barriers to, collaborative systems change work. However, these findings need to be understood within the context of police-community relations as fear and mistrust of police influence problem definitions and potential solutions. Therefore, the collaboratives model is not a one-size-fits-all approach to systems change work in the criminal justice system.

Journal Article,Improving with practice: A neural model of mathematical development.,"The ability to improve in speed and accuracy as a result of repeating some task is an important hallmark of intelligent biological systems. Although gradual behavioral improvements from practice have been modeled in spiking neural networks, few such models have attempted to explain cognitive development of a task as complex as addition. In this work, we model the progression from a counting-based strategy for addition to a recall-based strategy. The model consists of two networks working in parallel: a slower basal ganglia loop and a faster cortical network. The slow network methodically computes the count from one digit given another, corresponding to the addition of two digits, whereas the fast network gradually “memorizes” the output from the slow network. The faster network eventually learns how to add the same digits that initially drove the behavior of the slower network. Performance of this model is demonstrated by simulating a fully spiking neural network that includes basal ganglia, thalamus, and various cortical areas. Consequently, the model incorporates various neuroanatomical data, in terms of brain areas used for calculation and makes psychologically testable predictions related to frequency of rehearsal. Furthermore, the model replicates developmental progression through addition strategies in terms of reaction times and accuracy, and naturally explains observed symptoms of dyscalculia.

Journal Article,Nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) prospectively predicts smoking relapse: Longitudinal findings from ITC surveys in five countries.,"Introduction: The ratio of trans 3’-hydroxycotinine (3HC) to cotinine (nicotine metabolite ratio [NMR]) is a biomarker of the rate of nicotine metabolism, with higher NMR indicating faster metabolism. Higher NMR has been found to be associated with higher daily cigarette consumption and less success stopping smoking in cessation trials. This study examines differences in NMR among population-based samples of smokers in the five countries and explores the relationship between NMR and smoking abstinence. Methods: Participants (N = 874) provided saliva samples during International Tobacco Control (ITC) surveys in the United States, United Kingdom, Mauritius, Mexico, and Thailand conducted in 2010/2011 with follow-up surveys in 2012/2013. When all samples were received, they were sent to a common laboratory for analysis using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectroscopy. Results: There was significant variation in NMR across countries (F = 15.49, p F = 8.93; p = .003). Higher mean NMR values were also associated with longer quit duration (p = .007). There was no substantial difference in NMR between current smokers who made a failed quit attempt and those who made no attempt—both had significantly lower NMR compared to those who quit and remained abstinent. Smokers with a higher NMR were more likely to report that they stopped smoking compared to those with a lower NMR (odds ratio = 2.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.25 to 5.68). Conclusions: These results suggest faster nicotine metabolizers may be less likely to relapse following a quit attempt. This finding differs from results of clinical trials testing stop smoking medications, where slower metabolizers have been found to be more likely to maintain abstinence from smoking. Implications: Results of this study suggest faster nicotine metabolizers may be less likely to relapse following a quit attempt. This finding differs from results of clinical trials testing stop smoking medications, where slower metabolizers have been found to be more likely to maintain abstinence from smoking.

Journal Article,Employee age alters the effects of justice on emotional exhaustion and organizational deviance.,"Fairness in the workplace attenuates a host of negative individual and organizational outcomes. However, research on the psychology of aging challenges the assumption that fairness operates similarly across different age groups. The current research explored how older workers, vis-à-vis younger workers, react to perceptions of fairness. Integrating socioemotional selectivity theory and the multiple needs theory of organizational justice, we generated novel predictions regarding the relations between perceptions of workplace justice, emotional exhaustion, and employee deviance. Specifically, we hypothesized and found that employee age moderates the negative relation between justice facets and deviance (Study 1) and emotional exhaustion (Study 2). We also found that emotional exhaustion mediates the differential effects of justice on deviance, and that this relation depends on employee age (Study 2). Relative to younger workers, older workers are more sensitive to informational and interpersonal justice; in contrast, relative to older workers, younger workers are more sensitive to distributive and procedural justice. The research supports and extends existing theory on organizational justice and on the psychology of aging. Moreover, it highlights the importance of considering employee age as a focal variable of interest in the study of justice processes, and in organizational research more generally.

Journal Article,Cognitive and behavioural predictors of adolescents' communicative perspective-taking and social relationships.,"Given the pivotal role that social interactions play for adolescents' well-being, understanding the factors that influence communication is key. The present study examined relations between adolescents' communicative perspective-taking, executive function skills, and ADHD traits and explored the role communicative perspective-taking plays in peer relations. Data was collected from a community sample of 15 to 19-years-olds (N = 46) in Waterloo, Canada. Two communicative perspective-taking tasks required participants to infer speakers' communicative intentions. A battery of tasks assessed adolescents' working memory and inhibitory control. Elevated ADHD traits were associated with weaker working memory, inhibitory control, and communicative perspective-taking. Working memory was the strongest predictor of communicative perspective-taking. Highlighting the importance of communicative perspective-taking for social interactions, adolescents with weaker skills in this area reported worse peer relations. Findings underscore the importance of communicative perspective-taking for adolescents' social relations and have relevance for understanding the social difficulties faced by adolescents with elevated ADHD traits.

Journal Article,Upper extremity muscle activity during in-phase and anti-phase continuous pushing tasks.,"Objective: To determine the effect of anti-phase, in-phase bimanual and unimanual simulated industrial pushing tasks and frequency on upper extremity muscle activity. Background: Research investigating symmetrical (in-phase) and asymmetrical (anti-phase) pushing exertions is limited despite a high prevalence in industry. Methods: Fifteen female participants completed five pushing tasks using a dual handle apparatus at three frequencies: 15 cycles per minute (cpm), 30 cpm, and self-selected. Tasks included two bimanual symmetrical pushes (constrained and unconstrained), two bimanual asymmetrical pushes (reciprocating and continuous), and one right unimanual push. Surface electromyography (EMG) from the right anterior, middle, and posterior deltoid (AD, MD, and PD); right and left trapezius (RT and LT); right pectoralis major (PM); and right and left external obliques (REO and LEO) was collected and normalized to maximum voluntary effort. Results: There was a task by frequency interaction in the AD, MD, PD, and RT (p < .005), where activity in AD, MD, and PD was highest in the continuous task at 15 cpm, but activity was similar across task in 30 cpm and self-selected. Muscle activity coefficient of variation was lowest during continuous task across all frequencies. Conclusion: Continuous, anti-phase pushes and constrained, in-phase pushes had the highest muscle activity demands and the least amount of variability in muscle activity and therefore may present the greatest risk of injury. Application: Anti-phase pushing is known to have a greater cognitive demand, and this study demonstrated that it also has a greater physical demand when performed continuously.

Journal Article,Whose family fits? Categorization and evaluation of same-sex and cross-race-parent families.,"As family structures diversify, attitudes towards “nontraditional” families (e.g., same-sex-parent and cross-race families) appear to be becoming more favorable. Despite more favorable attitudes, we propose that explicitly and implicitly people view nontraditional families as less family-like than traditional (i.e., heterosexual, same-race) families. We also propose that people will hold the behavior of nontraditional (vs. traditional) families to higher standards. In Study 1, participants explicitly rated nontraditional (vs. traditional) family photos as less family-like and as less loving. In Study 2, using a reaction-time measure, participants took longer to correctly categorize nontraditional (vs. traditional) families into the family category, suggesting that at an implicit level people have greater difficulty recognizing nontraditional families as “family.” In Studies 3 and 4, ambiguous (i.e., positive and negative) behavior licensed more harsh evaluations of a nontraditional family—but did not affect evaluations of a traditional family—relative to learning only positive family behavior. Despite survey data that suggest that people’s views of nontraditional families are becoming more favorable, our evidence indicates that people nonetheless harbor prejudice against certain family structures. Beyond documenting two biases against nontraditional families, this work highlights the need for prejudice researchers to examine meaningful levels of social identity, such as family units, that are intermediate between individuals and broad social classes.

Journal Article,"Intentionality and meta-awareness of mind wandering: Are they one and the same, or distinct dimensions?","Researchers have recently demonstrated that mind-wandering episodes can vary on numerous dimensions, and it has been suggested that assessing these dimensions will play an important role in our understanding of mind wandering. One dimension that has received considerable attention in recent work is the intentionality of mind wandering. Although it has been claimed that indexing the intentionality of mind wandering will be necessary if researchers are to obtain a coherent understanding of the wandering mind, one concern is that this dimension might be redundant with another, longstanding, dimension: namely, meta-awareness. Thus, the utility of the argument for assessing intentionality rests upon a demonstration that this dimension is distinct from the meta-awareness dimension. To shed light on this issue, across two studies we compared and contrasted these dimensions to determine whether they are redundant or distinct. In both studies, we found support for the view that these dimensions are distinct. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)","Seli, Paul;Ralph, Brandon C.

Journal Article,Semantic and visual relatedness of distractors impairs episodic retrieval of pictures in a divided attention paradigm.,"We used a divided attention (DA) paradigm to infer the representational codes needed to support episodic retrieval of pictures, by measuring susceptibility to memory interference from different distracting tasks. Participants made recognition memory decisions to semantically categorized sets of pictures while simultaneously making size judgments to a set of visually-presented distractor pictures. Recognition accuracy was worse and response times were slower under DA conditions relative to full attention (FA), regardless of semantic relatedness of distractors to targets (Experiment 1). Similarly, we found no differential memory interference under DA relative to FA when distractor pictures were either visually (but not semantically), semantically (but not visually), or unrelated to the targets (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, memory interference was significantly larger under DA at retrieval when distractors were both semantically and visually similar to the targets. Findings suggest episodic memory for pictures requires access to either visually- or semantically-based representations for optimal performance.

Journal Article,What’s that you’re saying? Children with better executive functioning produce and repair communication more effectively.,"Young children often provide ambiguous referential statements. Thus, the ability to identify when miscommunication has occurred and subsequently repair messages is an essential component of communicative development. The present study examined the impact of listener feedback and children’s executive functioning in influencing children’s ability to repair their messages. Children (ages 4–6 years) completed a referential communication task, in which they described target pictures among an array of similar distractors for a confederate. Stimuli were designed such that children frequently provided ambiguous descriptions. Subsequently, the listener provided the children with feedback (detailed or vague) that they misunderstood the statement. Children also completed executive functioning tasks (working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility). Children with larger working memory capacities and better cognitive flexibility provided more effective initial descriptions of the targets. Children with better cognitive flexibility were also more effective at repairing their statements in response to feedback. Although children provided more effective repairs following detailed feedback (vs. vague feedback), this effect did not significantly interact with the cognitive skills of children. However, limited evidence emerged suggesting that cognitive flexibility may be more important when the listener provides vague feedback.

Journal Article,Scoping review of work disability policies and programs.,"Purpose: This scoping review identifies the foci of research articles that address government laws, policies and programs designed to foster labour market integration of people who, due to illness or disability, face challenges entering or staying in the workforce. Method: A systematic search of English-language peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2014 yielded 14,474 articles. Title and abstract review identified 723 included articles that addressed government-led programs, policy or legislation on work integration and/or income support after injury, illness or impairment. These were sorted by theme, work disability program or policy, disability type, jurisdiction and year published. Results: The number of articles published that address work disability laws, policies and programs increased steadily. Most articles addressed disability in general. Among articles with a specific health focus, mental health was the most common. Research gaps are identified for mixed method study designs, chronic and episodic conditions, illness and cancer, and for work disability policy studies outside of North America, Northern Europe and Australia. Conclusions: We find a growing number of published articles about work disability and policy and identify specific areas where is a need for further research.

Journal Article,Susceptibility to cigarette smoking among middle and high school e-cigarette users in Canada.,"There is a growing concern that the historic reductions in tobacco consumption witnessed in the past decades may be undermined by the rapid increase in e-cigarette use. This study examined the association between e-cigarette use and future intention to smoke cigarettes among middle and high school students who had never smoked cigarettes. Data were drawn from the 2014–2015 Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (n = 25,637). A multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine the association between e-cigarette use and susceptibility to cigarette smoking. In addition, an inverse probability of treatment weighted regression adjustment method (doubly robust estimator), which models both the susceptibility to smoking and the probability of e-cigarette use, was conducted. About 10% of the students had ever tried an e-cigarette. There were higher rates of ever e-cigarette use among students in grades 10–12 (12.5%) than those in grades 7–9 (7.3%). Students who had ever tried an e-cigarette had higher odds of susceptibility to cigarette smoking (adjusted odds ratio= 2.16, 95% confidence interval = 1.80–2.58) compared to those that had never tried an e-cigarette. Current use of an e-cigarette was associated with higher odds of smoking susceptibility (adjusted odds ratio = 2.02, 95% confidence interval = 1.43–2.84). Similar results were obtained from the doubly robust estimation. Among students who had never smoked cigarettes, e-cigarette use was associated with a higher susceptibility to cigarette smoking.

Journal Article,Explanations for not receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine: An Ontario Canada based survey.,"Despite evidence of the importance of the seasonal influenza vaccine for both individual and population health, only a third of the Ontario population received the vaccine in 2013/2014. The objective of this study was to identify why Ontarians are not getting the seasonal influenza vaccine. Written responses to the question “Why didn’t you get the seasonal flu vaccine in the last flu season?” were deductively analyzed using the Conceptual Model of Vaccine Hesitancy. Inductive coding was also conducted to identify explanations that fall outside of the present model and may be unique to the seasonal influenza vaccine. Data were collected between August and early September, 2014 through a survey in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario. Overall, 91.4% of responses could be explained using the conceptual model and specifically relate to perceived importance of vaccination (46.8%), moral convictions (19.4%), and past experiences with vaccinations services (14.5%). Notably, explanations related to healthcare professional attitudes, risk perceptions and trust, and subjective norms were identified to a much lesser extent than those discussed above. The remaining 8.6% of responses cannot be explained by the model because they do not relate to hesitancy. Our data contribute to the minimal body of Canadian research investigating low uptake of the seasonal flu vaccine, adding to an evidence-base upon which to inform promotional campaigns. Our data also highlight the utility of the Conceptual Model of Vaccine Hesitancy for the design and analysis of research investigating seasonal flu vaccine refusal or delay.

Journal Article,Family support policies and child outcomes: A realist-scoping review.,"Family support policies (FSP) refer to government policies that promote the well-being of families with children (e.g. job-protected paid leave, cash transfers, childcare). We developed an initial conceptual and theoretical framework of FSP and conducted a realist-scoping review to document the state of evidence regarding the influence of FSP on three child outcomes: poverty, development, and health. Based on the contexts and mechanisms through which FSP are hypothesized to affect child outcomes, we constructed a framework to guide a search of five electronic databases (OVID, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge). We analysed articles meeting our inclusion criteria (i.e. conceptualized FSP as a function of the welfare state; conceptualized child poverty, development, and health as outcomes; and conducted empirical analyses) in relation to our mechanisms and thematic concerns (context, developmental periods, and differential impacts). A total of 22 studies met our inclusion criteria, which tested 25 independent child outcomes. Our findings identified initial mechanisms that explain the relationship between FSP and child outcomes through (1) increasing parents’ basic capabilities, (2) shaping parents’ childcare options, and (3) influencing parental leave-taking and shifting beliefs about gender relationships in the home and workplace. Future work will be to test these mechanisms and framework through a realist synthesis.

Journal Article,How working with a helpful versus less helpful confederate influences joint-action in a pegboard task.,"Actors change their movement strategies to complement a coactor’s movements when performing cooperative tasks. To further investigate this topic, the authors designed a pegboard task whereby a participant-confederate pair worked together to move a peg from one side of the board to the other. The authors examined how the experience of working with a helpful confederate versus less helpful confederate influenced the participant’s movement behavior. Results provide evidence that participants change their movement behaviors in response to the actions of the confederate. Here the human capacity to act in such a manner exemplifies an individual’s ability to utilize his or her own action system to understand others and interact to complete joint action tasks. Individuals appear to adapt their behavior to their experiences, and thus may be helpful in some contexts and less helpful in others.

Journal Article,Identity horizons among Finnish postsecondary students: A comparative analysis.,"This article examines the identity horizons of postsecondary students in Finland—a country in which social welfare provisions buffer education-to-work transitions—comparing their identity horizons to those previously reported for U.S. and Japanese students. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed scalar invariance of the Finnish version of the Identity Horizons Scales with the English and Japanese versions. Latent mean comparisons found that Finnish students had the broadest educational and work horizons, and the lowest education-to-work identity anxiety. Finnish men reported lower levels of educational horizons and higher levels of identity anxiety than Finnish women, replicating previous findings. Social class differences were also detected, with higher levels of identity anxiety and narrower educational horizons among those whose parents had no postsecondary education. Based on the apparent impacts on identity development of the different educational policies in the three countries, results are discussed in terms of policy implications supporting more effective education- to-work transitions.

Journal Article,Antipsychotic use in dementia: Is there a problem and are there solutions?,"Antipsychotics are necessary for many older adults to treat major mental illnesses or reduce distressing psychiatric symptoms. Current controversy exists over the role of antipsychotics in the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in persons with dementia. Although some NPS may be appropriately and safely treated with antipsychotics, a fine balance must be achieved between the benefits of these medications, which are often modest, and adverse events, which may have significant consequences. Approximately one-third of all persons with dementia are currently prescribed antipsychotic medications, and there is significant variation in the use of antipsychotics across care settings and providers. Reducing the inappropriate or unnecessary use of antipsychotics among persons with dementia has been the focus of increasing attention owing to better awareness of the potential problems associated with these medications. Several approaches can be used to curb the use of antipsychotics among persons with dementia, including policy or regulatory changes, public reporting, and educational outreach. Recently, there has been encouraging evidence of a downward trend in the use of antipsychotics in many long-term care settings, although prescribing rates are still higher than what is likely optimal. Although reducing the inappropriate use of antipsychotics is a complex task, psychiatrists can play an important role via the provision of clinical care and research evidence, contributing to improved care of persons with dementia in Canada and elsewhere.

Journal Article,A model for (re)building consumer trust in the food system.,"The article presents a best practice model that can be utilized by food system actors to assist with (re) building trust in the food system, before, during and after a food incident defined as ‘any situation within the food supply chain where there is a risk or potential risk of illness or confirmed illness or injury associated with the consumption of a food or foods’ (Commonwealth of Australia. National Food Incident Response Protocol. Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra, 2012). Interviews were undertaken with 105 actors working within the media, food industry and food regulatory settings across Australia, New Zealand (NZ) and the United Kingdom (UK). Interview data produced strategy statements, which indicated participant views on how to (re)build consumer trust in the food system. These included: (i) be transparent, (ii) have protocols and procedures in place, (iii) be credible, (iv) be proactive, (v) put consumers first, (vi) collaborate with stakeholders, (vii) be consistent, (viii) educate stakeholders and consumers, (ix) build your reputation and (x) keep your promises. A survey was designed to enable participants to indicate their agreement/disagreement with the ideas, rate their importance and provide further comment. The five strategies considered key to (re)building consumer trust were used to develop a model demonstrating best practice strategies for (re)building consumer trust in the food system before, during and after a food incident. In a world where the food system is increasingly complex, strategies for (re)building and fostering consumer trust are important. This study offers a model to do so which is derived from the views and experiences of actors working across the food industry, food regulation and the media.

Journal Article,Extending the Stabilized Supralinear Network model for binocular image processing.,"The visual cortex is both extensive and intricate. Computational models are needed to clarify the relationships between its local mechanisms and high-level functions. The Stabilized Supralinear Network (SSN) model was recently shown to account for many receptive field phenomena in V1, and also to predict subtle receptive field properties that were subsequently confirmed in vivo. In this study, we performed a preliminary exploration of whether the SSN is suitable for incorporation into large, functional models of the visual cortex, considering both its extensibility and computational tractability. First, whereas the SSN receives abstract orientation signals as input, we extended it to receive images (through a linear–nonlinear stage), and found that the extended version behaved similarly. Secondly, whereas the SSN had previously been studied in a monocular context, we found that it could also reproduce data on interocular transfer of surround suppression. Finally, we reformulated the SSN as a convolutional neural network, and found that it scaled well on parallel hardware. These results provide additional support for the plausibility of the SSN as a model of lateral interactions in V1, and suggest that the SSN is well suited as a component of complex vision models. Future work will use the SSN to explore relationships between local network interactions and sophisticated vision processes in large networks.

Journal Article,Social anxiety is characterized by biased learning about performance and the self.,"People learn about their self from social information, and recent work suggests that healthy adults show a positive bias for learning self-related information. In contrast, social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by a negative view of the self, yet what causes and maintains this negative self-view is not well understood. Here the authors use a novel experimental paradigm and computational model to test the hypothesis that biased social learning regarding self-evaluation and self-feelings represents a core feature that distinguishes adults with SAD from healthy controls. Twenty-one adults with SAD and 35 healthy controls (HCs) performed a speech in front of 3 judges. They subsequently evaluated themselves and received performance feedback from the judges and then rated how they felt about themselves and the judges. Affective updating (i.e., change in feelings about the self over time, in response to feedback from the judges) was modeled using an adapted Rescorla-Wagner learning model. HCs demonstrated a positivity bias in affective updating, which was absent in SAD. Further, self-performance ratings revealed group differences in learning from positive feedback—a difference that endured at an average of 1 year follow up. These findings demonstrate the presence and long-term endurance of positively biased social learning about the self among healthy adults, a bias that is absent or reversed among socially anxious adults.

Journal Article,The effect of losses disguised as wins and near misses in electronic gaming machines: A systematic review.,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 33(4) of Journal of Gambling Studies (see record 2017-49546-015). The second author’s name was incorrectly published as 'Y. Yazdani' instead of 'A. Yazdani'. This has been corrected with this erratum.] Near misses and losses disguised as wins have been of interest to gambling researchers and policymakers for many years (e.g., Griffiths in J Gambl Stud 9(2):101–120, 1993). This systematic literature review describes the behavioural, psychological, and psychobiological effects of near misses and losses disguised as wins (LDWs) in an effort to evaluate their precise influence on the player and to highlight areas requiring further investigation. A systematic search for relevant studies was conducted using Scopus, PubMed, PsycINFO, ProQuest Sociology databases, and the Gambling Research Exchange Ontario Knowledge Repository. A total of 51 (from an initial pool of 802) experimental peer-reviewed studies using human participants were found between 1991 and 2015. The systematic review revealed that near misses motivate continued play, but have varying effects on the emotional state or betting behaviour of the player. Near miss events were also shown to be associated with elevated skin conductance levels and diffuse activity across the brain, most consistently in areas processing reinforcement and reward. Re-examination of the studies of near misses events after classifying the type of game feedback suggested that the effectiveness of near misses is related to the phenomenology of a near miss itself rather than as a response to auditory or visual feedback provided by a slot machine. In contrast to near misses, the presence of LDWs was found to relate to an overestimation of how much a player is actually winning and was consistently viewed as an exciting event. The effect of LDWs appears to be driven by the presence of visuals and sounds most often associated with a true win. Practical implications and directions for future research are also discussed.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-49546-014). Near misses and losses disguised as wins have been of interest to gambling researchers and policymakers for many years (e.g., Griffiths in J Gambl Stud 9(2):101–120, 1993). This systematic literature review describes the behavioural, psychological, and psychobiological effects of near misses and losses disguised as wins (LDWs) in an effort to evaluate their precise influence on the player and to highlight areas requiring further investigation. A systematic search for relevant studies was conducted using Scopus, PubMed, PsycINFO, ProQuest Sociology databases, and the Gambling Research Exchange Ontario Knowledge Repository. A total of 51 (from an initial pool of 802) experimental peer-reviewed studies using human participants were found between 1991 and 2015. The systematic review revealed that near misses motivate continued play, but have varying effects on the emotional state or betting behaviour of the player. Near miss events were also shown to be associated with elevated skin conductance levels and diffuse activity across the brain, most consistently in areas processing reinforcement and reward. Re-examination of the studies of near misses events after classifying the type of game feedback suggested that the effectiveness of near misses is related to the phenomenology of a near miss itself rather than as a response to auditory or visual feedback provided by a slot machine. In contrast to near misses, the presence of LDWs was found to relate to an overestimation of how much a player is actually winning and was consistently viewed as an exciting event. The effect of LDWs appears to be driven by the presence of visuals and sounds most often associated with a true win. Practical implications and directions for future research are also discussed.

Journal Article,Residents’ support for red tourism in China: The moderating effect of central government.,"This study proposes and tests a model that incorporates two competing theories of political trust, institutional trust and cultural trust, to examine community support for ‘‘red tourism” development. Using data gathered from residents living in close proximity to Jinggangshan Scenic Area in China, this study examines the influence of authoritarian values, particularly as they relate to level of residents’ power, their level of trust in government, and their effects on support for ‘‘red tourism.” Findings suggest that trust in central government moderates the relationship between trust in local government and support. Future studies should utilize the institutional trust framework to assess residents’ trust in the local government and the cultural trust framework to assess trust in the central government.

Journal Article,Consumers’ response to an on‐shelf nutrition labelling system in supermarkets: Evidence to inform policy and practice.,"Context: Providing a nutrition rating system on the front of food packages or on retail shelf tags has been proposed as a policy strategy for supporting healthier food choices. Guiding Stars is an on‐shelf nutrition labelling system that scores foods in a supermarket based on nutritional quality; scores are then translated into ratings of 0 to 3 stars. It is consistent with evidence‐informed recommendations for well‐designed labels, except for not labelling 0‐star products. The largest supermarket retailer in Canada rolled out the Guiding Stars system in supermarkets across Ontario, Canada. The aim of our study was to examine the extent to which consumers respond to an on‐shelf nutrition labelling system in supermarkets to inform current and future nutrition labelling policies and practices. Methods: Capitalizing on a natural experiment, we conducted a quasi‐experimental study across 3 supermarket banners (or “chains”) in Ontario, one of which implemented the Guiding Stars system in 2012. We used aggregated supermarket transaction data to test the effect of Guiding Stars on the nutritional quality of food purchases in intervention supermarkets relative to control supermarkets. We also conducted exit surveys among 783 randomly selected shoppers from intervention and control supermarkets to assess consumer awareness, understanding, trust, and self‐reported use of the labelling system. Findings: Relative to control supermarkets, shoppers in intervention supermarkets made small but significant shifts toward purchasing foods with higher nutritional ratings; however, shifts varied in direction and magnitude across food categories. These shifts translated into foods being purchased with slightly less trans fat and sugar and more fiber and omega‐3 fatty acids. We also found increases in the number of products per transaction, price per product purchased, and total revenues. Results of the exit surveys indicate a modest proportion of consumers were aware of, understood, and trusted Guiding Stars in intervention supermarkets, and a small proportion of consumers reported using this system when making purchasing decisions. However, 47% of shoppers exposed to Guiding Stars were confused when asked to interpret the meaning of a 0‐star product that does not display a rating on the shelf tag. Conclusions: This study demonstrates support for policies promoting on‐shelf nutrition labels designed according to evidence‐informed principles, but policymakers should move forward with caution when investing in such systems until research has confirmed optimal label design, clarified the mechanisms through which dietary intake is improved, and assessed associations with nutrition‐related health outcomes.

Journal Article,“I like my peeps”: Diversifying the Net Generation's digital leisure.,"The current generation of adolescents is the first to have grown up with the widespread use of the internet as part of their everyday lives; they are the Net Generation. To diversify existing research on this generation’s digital practices, this study explored the intersectional experiences of diverse immigrant adolescent girls’ digital leisure. Conversational interviews with nine girls revealed that they encountered numerous interpersonal leisure constraints following their immigration to Canada. Within their digital leisure, girls were able to negotiate these constraints through online connections with family and friends back home, Canadian friends, and the global village. These online connections facilitated an expansion of social boundaries and communication with both familiar and broad networks to maintain and develop relationships, pursue interests, share culture, and resist limiting gendered norms with the unparalleled interactivity and sociability of digital leisure.

Journal Article,Perceptions of community-dwelling patients and their physicians on OxyContin® discontinuation and the impact on chronic pain management.,"OxyContin, formerly one of the most commonly prescribed medications for chronic pain in Canada, was discontinued, delisted from the Ontario Drug Formulary, and replaced by a tamper-resistant formulation in 2012. The impact of discontinuing OxyContin on patients formerly prescribed it to treat chronic pain was unreported. Patients with chronic pain aged 45 years and over (n = 13) were recruited from two primary care and one specialty practice sites and interviewed using a semistructured guide to capture their experiences with discontinuing OxyContin, the efficacy of alternate medications, and relationships with physicians. Additional interviews were conducted with their physicians (n = 7) to obtain physician perceptions on discontinuation and to expand understanding of the patients’ experiences. Aspects of patients’ pain and medical care through the discontinuation process revealed emergent themes that both converge and diverge from that of treating physicians. Areas of divergence include the motive for discontinuation, which was condemned by most patients but supported by all physicians, and the perceived impact of discontinuance on pain control, with the majority of patients experiencing a negative impact and most physicians describing it as insignificant. Perceptions of patients and physicians coincided on the need to optimize pain management practices.

Journal Article,An examination of how changing patterns of school travel mode impact moderate-to-vigorous physical activity among adolescents over time.,"Background: This study examined temporal variations in school travel mode and whether these variations predicted changes in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among adolescents (Grades 9 to 12). Methods: We analyzed data from Years 1, 2 and 3 of the COMPASS study. Students included in the analysis were those who had provided information on sociodemographic factors, MVPA and school travel modes. A final longitudinal sample included 19,868 participants for the analyses related to travel mode to school (AM period) and 17,678 for the travel mode from school (PM period). The proportion of participants who changed their school travel modes between years was calculated to determine the stability of school travel mode. Linear-mixed models were used to examine whether changes in mode predicted changes in MVPA one year later. These models adjusted for sociodemographic factors as covariates and accounted for the clustering within schools. Results: Stability in school travel mode was observed for both time periods. Across data collection waves, only 9.3% consistently used an active transportation mode in the AM period and 15.6% in the PM period. Only 2.5% switched from a passive to active mode in the AM period and 3.1% in the PM period, whereas 3.5% switched from an active to passive mode in the AM period and 5.2% in the PM period. No significant association was observed for the AM period. For the PM period, the decrease in MVPA was significantly greater in adolescents who switched from an active to a passive transportation mode than those who remained using a passive transportation mode across years. Conclusion: School travel makes a contribution to the amount of MVPA youth accumulate during the school week although evidence for this was restricted to those shifting from active to passive modes in the afternoon period.

Journal Article,Factors associated with current smoking among off-reserve First Nations and Métis youth: Results from the 2012 Aboriginal Peoples Survey.,"First Nations and Métis, two of Canada’s constitutionally recognized Indigenous groups, suffer from poorer overall health than non-Indigenous Canadians. Current smoking, a known predictor of chronic health conditions, is close to twice as prevalent among Indigenous youth as it is among non-Indigenous Canadian youth. However, little population-level research has examined the correlates of current smoking among this population. Guided by a health framework centered on Indigenous-specific determinants, we used data from the 2012 Aboriginal Peoples Survey to examine the correlates of current smoking among First Nations and Métis youth aged 15–17 years living outside of First Nations reserves. Using binary logistic regression, we investigated how culturally specific factors, namely knowledge of an Indigenous language, participation in traditional activities, and family members’ attendance at residential schools, were correlated with current smoking. We also considered demographic, geographic, socioeconomic and health-related correlates. Overall, an estimated 20.6% of First Nations and Métis youth reported current smoking. We found no significant associations between culturally specific activities and current smoking in the multivariate analyses, although those who spoke an Indigenous language were more likely to smoke. Those who participated in sports more often were less likely to smoke, and respondents who reported heavy drinking and who were from families with lower income were more likely to smoke. Gender, body mass index, urban/rural geography and regional geography, and mother’s highest level of education were not significantly correlated with smoking. The results of our study support prior research that has found a disturbingly high prevalence of current smoking among Indigenous youth, compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts. Our results highlight the importance of considering sports participation, co-occurring health-risk behaviours and socioeconomic factors when developing interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of smoking among First Nations and Métis youth.

Journal Article,Not all probabilities are equivalent: Evidence from orientation versus spatial probability learning.,"Frequently targets are detected faster, probable locations searched earlier, and likely orientations estimated more precisely. Are these all consequences of a single, domain-general “attentional” effect? To examine this issue, participants were shown brief instances of spatial gratings, and were tasked to draw their location and orientation. Unknown to participants, either the location or orientation probability of these gratings were manipulated. While orientation probability affected the precision of orientation reports, spatial probability did not. Further, utilising lowered stimulus contrast (via a staircase procedure) and a combination of behavioral precision and confidence self-report, we clustered trials with perceived stimuli from trials where the target was not detected: Spatial probability only modulated the likelihood of stimulus detection, but not did not modulate perceptual precision. Even when no physical attentional cues are present, acquired probabilistic information on space versus orientation leads to separable ‘attention-like’ effects on behaviour. We discuss how this could be linked to distinct underlying neural mechanisms.

Journal Article,Siblings of children with a complex chronic health condition: Maternal posttraumatic growth as a predictor of changes in child behavior problems.,"Objective: The present study examined the role of maternal posttraumatic growth in changes in behavioral problems among the siblings of children with complex chronic health conditions. Methods: Data were collected from a sample of 70 siblings from 58 families with at least one child diagnosed with a life-threatening genetic, metabolic, or neurological condition. Every 6 months for up to 4 years, sibling behavior problems were assessed through both parent-reports and youth self-reports. At each visit, mothers also completed self-reports of posttraumatic growth. Results: Time-lagged multilevel regression analyses revealed that higher levels of maternal posttraumatic growth predicted subsequent declines in parent-reported internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems among healthy siblings. These findings were partially replicated using youth self-reports of their own behavior problems. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the benefits of posttraumatic growth may extend beyond the self to other family members, particularly to children in the family.

Journal Article,Multivariate trajectories across multiple domains of health-related quality of life in children with new-onset epilepsy.,"The diagnosis of epilepsy in children is known to impact the trajectory of their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) over time. However, there is limited knowledge about variations in longitudinal trajectories across multiple domains of HRQOL. This study aims to characterize the heterogeneity in HRQOL trajectories across multiple HRQOL domains and to evaluate predictors of differences among the identified trajectory groups in children with new-onset epilepsy. Data were obtained from the Health Related Quality of Life in Children with Epilepsy Study (HERQULES), a prospective multi-center study of 373 children newly diagnosed with new-onset epilepsy who were followed up over 2 years. Child HRQOL and family factors were reported by parents, and clinical characteristics were reported by neurologists. Group-based multi-trajectory modeling was adopted to characterize longitudinal trajectories of HRQOL as measured by the individual domains of cognitive, emotional, physical, and social functioning in the 55-item Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy Questionnaire (QOLCE-55). Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess potential factors that explain differences among the identified latent trajectory groups. Three distinct HRQOL trajectory subgroups were identified in children with new-onset epilepsy based on HRQOL scores: “High” (44.7%), “Intermediate” (37.0%), and “Low” (18.3%). While most trajectory groups exhibited increasing scores over time on physical and social domains, both flat and declining trajectories were noted on emotional and cognitive domains. Less severe epilepsy, an absence of cognitive and behavioral problems, lower parental depression scores, better family functioning, and fewer family demands were associated with a “Higher” or “Intermediate” HRQOL trajectory. The course of HRQOL over time in children with new-onset epilepsy appears to follow one of three different trajectories. Addressing the clinical and psychosocial determinants identified for each pattern can help clinicians provide more targeted care to these children and their families.

Journal Article,Reading aloud: Discrete stage(s) redux.,"Interactive activation accounts of processing have had a broad and deep influence on cognitive psychology, particularly so in the context of computational accounts of reading aloud at the single word level. Here we address the issue of whether such a framework can simulate the joint effects of stimulus quality and word frequency (which have been shown to produce both additive and interactive effects depending on the context). We extend previous work on this question by considering an alternative implementation of a stimulus quality manipulation, and the role of interactive activation. Simulations with a version of the Dual Route Cascaded model (a model with interactive activation dynamics along the lexical route) demonstrate that the model is unable to simulate the entire pattern seen in human performance. We discuss how a hybrid interactive activation model that includes some context dependent staged processing could accommodate these data.

Journal Article,Gating at early cortical processing stages is associated with changes in behavioural performance on a sensory conflict task.,"While there is evidence to show early enhancement of modality-specific somatosensory cortical event-related potentials (ERP) when two stimuli are task-relevant, less is understood about the cortical and behavioural correlates of early modality-specific sensory gating. This study sought to understand how attentional gating affects cortical processing of visual and tactile stimuli at early stages of modality-specific representation. Specifically, alterations in early somatosensory and visual processing based on attentional relevance were examined, along with the effect of an unattended sensory stimulus on cortical processing and behavioural performance. Electroencephalography (EEG) was collected from healthy participants as they performed a sensory selection task. This task required participants to make a scaled motor response to the amplitudes of visual and tactile stimuli presented individually or concurrently. Results showed that the somatosensory N70 ERP was significantly attenuated when tactile stimuli were unattended. When visual stimuli were unattended, modulation of visual potentials occurred later, at the visual P2 potential. Since unattended tactile stimuli were gated at early cortical processing stages, when they were used as distractors, no changes in cortical responses to target stimuli were observed. Additionally, there was no decrease in task accuracy when grading attended stimuli in the presence of a tactile distractor. However, since early gating was not observed in the visual modality, a visual stimulus used as an unattended distractor resulted in smaller-amplitude cortical responses to attended tactile stimuli and less accurate task performance when grading attended stimuli. In conclusion, this study suggests that early gating of unattended stimuli supports modality-specific cortical processing of target stimuli and maintains behavioural task performance.

Journal Article,Suicidal behaviour among adolescents and young adults with self-reported chronic illness.,"Objective: The aims of this study were to estimate the: (1) 12-mo prevalence of suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts in a population sample of adolescents and young adults with and without chronic illness; (2) associations among chronic illness and suicidal thoughts and behaviour (STB); and, (3) moderating roles of mood and substance use disorder on this association. Method: Individuals were aged 15 to 30 y (n = 5,248) from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health. Twelve-month STB and psychiatric disorder were measured using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. Multinomial logistic regression examined associations between chronic illness and STB, adjusting for relevant sociodemographic and health characteristics. Product term interactions among chronic illness, mood, and substance use disorders were included in the regression models to examine potential moderating effects. Results: Prevalence of suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts was higher in individuals with chronic illness (P < 0.01 for all). After adjustment, chronic illness increased the odds for suicidal thoughts [OR = 1.28 (1.01 to 1.64)], plans [OR = 2.34 (1.22 to 4.39)], and attempts [OR = 4.63 (1.52 to 14.34)]. In the presence v. absence of a mood disorder, the odds for suicidal thoughts were higher among individuals with chronic illness [OR = 1.89 (1.06 to 5.28)]. Conclusions: Suicidal thoughts and behaviours are common among adolescents and young adults with chronic illness, particularly among those with comorbid mood disorders. Health professionals should routinely ask about STB during assessments of their adolescent and young adult patients.

Comment/Reply,The need for a comprehensive framework.,"Reply by the current authors to the comments made by Coral Gartner (see record 2016-60096-004), Becky Freeman (see record 2016-60096-005) & Jamie Brown (see record 2016-60096-006) on the original article (see record 2016-60096-003). We agree with Freeman that there are many factors other than policies that influence the use and uptake of vaporized nicotine products (VNPs). However, most of the factors that she mentions—curiosity, nicotine addiction, for example—are not readily modifiable. In contrast, the framework that we describe focuses on the role of policies to facilitate individual and population-level behavior change in the same way that tobacco control policies have been used to reduce cigarette consumption. As Freeman has argued, continued use of VNPs depends upon the relative appeal and marketing of VNPs. By reducing the costs to smokers of switching to reduced risk alternatives, this approach could be especially effective in addressing the central problem of high smoking rates among vulnerable populations which Gartner has highlighted. As Brown has argued so eloquently, our paper is an attempt to provide an integrated and overarching framework to address the complex patterns of poly-tobacco and nicotine use.

Journal Article,Older females in the workforce—The effects of age on psychophysical estimates of maximum acceptable lifting loads.,"The number of older workers in the workforce is increasing substantially, and advanced age is associated with factors that could influence musculoskeletal injury risk and work capacity. This study’s goals were to test whether psychophysical estimates of maximum acceptable weight of lift (liftmax) differed between younger and older workers, and to examine potential explanatory factors. Twenty-four female workers (half 50 + years; half 20–32 years) self-adjusted a box’s mass to their perceived liftmax during four lifting tasks. Older workers’ liftmax values were significantly lower (by approximately 24%) than their younger counterparts. There were no age-related differences in resting heart rate, or peak joint angles and final heart rate during the lifting trials. However, the older group demonstrated lower grip strength (by 24%), and lower heart rate reserve during the trials (by 18%). These results question whether current maximum acceptable lifting weights based on psychophysical information are appropriately protective for female workers greater than 50 years of age.

Journal Article,A short Boredom Proneness Scale: Development and psychometric properties.,"It has been evident for some time that the Boredom Proneness Scale (BPS), a commonly used measure of trait boredom, does not constitute a single scale. Factor analytic studies have identified anything from two to seven factors, prompting Vodanovich and colleagues to propose an alternative two factor, short form version Boredom Proneness Scale–Short Form (BPS-SR). The present study further investigates the factor structure and validity of both the BPS and the BPS-SR. The two-factor solution obtained for the BPS-SR appears to be an artifact of item wording of reverse-scored items. These same items may also have contributed to the earlier complexity and inconsistency of results for the full BPS. An eight-item scale of only consistently worded items (i.e., those not requiring reverse scoring) was developed. This new scale demonstrated unidimensionality and the scale score had good internal consistency and construct validity comparable to the original BPS score.

Journal Article,Self-affirmation facilitates minority middle schoolers’ progress along college trajectories.,"Small but timely experiences can have long-term benefits when their psychological effects interact with institutional processes. In a followup of two randomized field experiments, a brief values affirmation intervention designed to buffer minority middle schoolers against the threat of negative stereotypes had long-term benefits on college-relevant outcomes. In study 1, conducted in the Mountain West, the intervention increased Latino Americans’ probability of entering a college readiness track rather than a remedial one near the transition to high school 2 y later. In study 2, conducted in the Northeast, the intervention increased African Americans’ probability of college enrollment 7–9 y later. Among those who enrolled in college, affirmed African Americans attended relatively more selective colleges. Lifting a psychological barrier at a key transition can facilitate students’ access to positive institutional channels, giving rise to accumulative benefits.

Erratum/Correction,'The wisdom in virtue: Pursuit of virtue predicts wise reasoning about personal conflicts': Corrigendum.,"Reports an error in 'The wisdom in virtue: Pursuit of virtue predicts wise reasoning about personal conflicts' by Alex C. Huynh, Harrison Oakes, Garrett R. Shay and Ian McGregor (Psychological Science, 2017[Dec], Vol 28[12], 1848-1856). In the original article results for the Pursuit of Virtue × Conflict Type interaction in Study 2 were incorrectly reported. The correct results are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-56249-012). Most people can reason relatively wisely about others’ social conflicts, but often struggle to do so about their own (i.e., Solomon’s paradox). We suggest that true wisdom should involve the ability to reason wisely about both others’ and one’s own social conflicts, and we investigated the pursuit of virtue as a construct that predicts this broader capacity for wisdom. Results across two studies support prior findings regarding Solomon’s paradox: Participants (N = 623) more strongly endorsed wise-reasoning strategies (e.g., intellectual humility, adopting an outsider’s perspective) for resolving other people’s social conflicts than for resolving their own. The pursuit of virtue (e.g., pursuing personal ideals and contributing to other people) moderated this effect of conflict type. In both studies, greater endorsement of the pursuit of virtue was associated with greater endorsement of wise-reasoning strategies for one’s own personal conflicts; as a result, participants who highly endorsed the pursuit of virtue endorsed wise-reasoning strategies at similar levels for resolving their own social conflicts and resolving other people’s social conflicts. Implications of these results and underlying mechanisms are explored and discussed.

Journal Article,Asymmetries between convergence and divergence reveal tonic vergence is dependent upon phasic vergence function.,"Horizontal vergence eye movements are controlled by two processes, phasic and slow-tonic. Slow-tonic responses are hypothesized to be stimulated by the faster, pulse-step neural output of the phasic system. This suggests that the general behavior of each system should be similar; however, this relationship has yet to be investigated directly. We characterize the relationship between phasic and tonic vergence by quantifying directional asymmetries in the response properties of each mechanism to the same disparity amplitudes. Four subjects viewed symmetric steps in disparity dichoptically at 40 cm while eye movements were recorded with infrared oculography. First- and secondorder phasic and slow-tonic convergence response properties increased linearly with disparity demand (p p > 0.05). Phasic divergence responses were slower than convergence (p = 0.012) and were associated with a higher frequency of saccades (p r = 0.78, p < 0.0001. Clear directional asymmetries were observed in phasic and tonic vergence responses. The response properties of the slow-tonic mechanism varied directly with the peak velocity of the complementary phasic system. These results provide empirical evidence of the relationship between phasic and slow-tonic vergence, suggesting that the latter depends on the motor function of the former, specifically the peak velocity. The recruitment of additional oculomotor mechanisms, such as saccades, improved the phasic response properties of the slower divergence mechanism but did not directly influence the response behavior of the slow-tonic mechanism.

Journal Article,Executive function deficits in team sport athletes with a history of concussion revealed by a visual-auditory dual task paradigm.,"The purpose of this study was to examine executive functions in team sport athletes with and without a history of concussion. Executive functions comprise many cognitive processes including, working memory, attention and multi-tasking. Past research has shown that concussions cause difficulties in vestibular-visual and vestibular-auditory dual-tasking, however, visual-auditory tasks have been examined rarely. Twenty-nine intercollegiate varsity ice hockey athletes (age = 19.13, SD = 1.56; 15 females) performed an experimental dual-task paradigm that required simultaneously processing visual and auditory information. A brief interview, event description and self-report questionnaires were used to assign participants to each group (concussion, no-concussion). Eighteen athletes had a history of concussion and 11 had no concussion history. The two tests involved visuospatial working memory (i.e., Corsi block test) and auditory tone discrimination. Participants completed both tasks individually, then simultaneously. Two outcome variables were measured, Corsi block memory span and auditory tone discrimination accuracy. No differences were shown when each task was performed alone; however, athletes with a history of concussion had a significantly worse performance on the tone discrimination task in the dual-task condition. In conclusion, long-term deficits in executive functions were associated with a prior history of concussion when cognitive resources were stressed. Evaluations of executive functions and divided attention appear to be helpful in discriminating participants with and without a history concussion.

Journal Article,"Malleability of taste perception: Biasing effects of rating scale format on taste recognition, product evaluation, and willingness to pay.","Product-related cues, such as brand or price, can influence consumers’ taste perception. Going beyond this observation, we examine the extent to which a stimulus-extrinsic factor, such as the format of the measurement tool on which consumers describe attributes of a taste sample, influences concurrent taste perception, and in turn, later taste recognition, overall product evaluation, and willingness to pay (WTP). The results of two experiments show that rating scale format (i) influences consumers’ concurrent impression of a taste sample, (ii) systematically biases later identification of the sample in a taste recognition test, and (iii) affects overall product evaluation and WTP. However, scale format (iv) does not influence ratings and downstream judgments when consumers are highly knowledgeable in the product domain. These findings demonstrate that the experience of taste is fleeting and not well represented in memory, and that like other subjective experiences, taste needs to be reconstructed based on accessible cues.

Journal Article,Becoming a religious none: Irreligious socialization and disaffiliation.,"The rise in the numbers of religious “nones” is an almost universal phenomenon across the Western world. The purpose of this study is to explore the extent to which religious nones are socialized to adopt a “no religion” position as children, as compared with disaffiliating during their teen or adult years. Related, among those religious nones who come from a religious background, we examine the timing and depth of a person's disaffiliation. This study sheds light on these issues by combining a quantitative analysis of religious nones samples in Alberta, Canada, America, and other international contexts with a qualitative analysis of 30 semistructured interviews with religious nones. Building on a stage of decline framework, we argue that while disaffiliation has been a lead catalyst for the growth among the religious none population—and we offer several observations of what fuels disaffiliation—moving forward we can and should expect irreligious socialization to gradually take the lead in explaining rising religious none figures.

Journal Article,"The relationship between children's executive functioning, theory of mind, and verbal skills with their own and others' behaviour in a cooperative context: Changes in relations from early to middle school‐age.","Learning to behave in socially competent ways is an essential component of children's development. This study examined the relations between children's social, communicative, and cognitive skills and their behaviours during a cooperative task, as well as how these relationships change at different ages. Early school‐age (5–8 years old) and middle school‐age (9–12 years old) children completed tasks to assess their executive functioning (i.e., inhibitory control, working memory, and planning), theory of mind, and verbal skills and participated in an interactive cooperative task. Because children participated in pairs, dyadic data analysis was used to examine the effect of individual characteristics on children's own and their partners' social behaviour. Results indicated that better theory of mind was related to lower levels of the competitive behaviours demonstrated by younger children, as well as by partners. In contrast, for older children, planning and verbal skills related to lower levels of competitive behaviour. The associations of theory of mind and planning skills with behaviour were significantly different between the early and middle school‐age groups. Findings suggest that children may utilize different skills at various developmental stages to guide their social behaviours. Findings have implications for theories of children's social development, as well as for interventions aimed at enhancing social skills. Highlights: 1. Children's theory of mind, executive functioning, and verbal skills were assessed in relation to their own and a peer's social behaviour. 2. Dyadic analyses were used to examine children's cooperative and competitive behaviour during an interactive task with a peer. 3.

Journal Article,Self-control at work.,"Self-control is an important component of organizational life, with organizational members constantly needing to exert self-control to overcome their desires and achieve long-term goals. Attesting to this importance,much research has focused on why individuals lose self-control and the consequences of self-control failure for individuals and organizations. Unfortunately, this research has overly focused on one component of self-control—resource depletion perspectives (and ego depletion perspectives in particular)—while neglecting other components that play equally important roles in the self-control process. As such, we argue that the organizational literature has failed to appreciate the broader picture of what components are involved in the self-control process, and the extent to which these components are intertwined with organizational phenomenon. In this review, we address these issues by using an integrative self-control theory framework to review the management self-control literature, outlining seven components of self-control within three broad phases of the self-control process (activation, exertion, and enactment). This framework integrates the relevant literature into a larger self-control process model, and highlights concerns with existing depletion perspectives as well as the lack of attention paid to other components in the self-control process. We discuss the implications of these issues for future research on self-control. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)","Lian, Huiwen;Yam, Kai Chi;Ferris, D.

Journal Article,An ecofeminist narrative of urban nature connection.,"The purpose of this study was to explore meanings, experiences, and perceived impacts associated with an urban nature connection program as narrated by mothers of program participants. “Project Connect”, a charity organization established in 2008, delivers the program investigated in urban parks and green spaces in Toronto, Canada. Drawing on ecofeminism and narrative inquiry, the study reveals a community narrative that depicts how Project Connect serves a group of mothers as an incubator of relationships spanning social and environmental domains, and which enable resistance of status quo forces that shape contemporary cityscapes. Nature connection in this sense is very much a political and cultural process that opens opportunities to challenge but also reproduce aspects of the dominant nature-related discourses. Accordingly, this study prompts consideration of the power of mothers and an ethics of care to transform human-nature relationships, and weaves critical consciousness and cautious re-valuing around the nature narratives we tell.

Journal Article,Perceptions of branded and plain cigarette packaging among Mexican youth.,"Plain cigarette packaging, which seeks to remove all brand imagery and standardize the shape and size of cigarette packs, represents a novel policy measure to reduce the appeal of cigarettes. Plain packaging has been studied primarily in high-income countries like Australia and the UK. It is unknown whether the effects of plain packaging may differ in low-and-middle income countries with a shorter history of tobacco regulation, such as Mexico. An experimental study was conducted in Mexico City to examine perceptions of branded and plain cigarette packaging among smoking and non-smoking Mexican adolescents (n = 359). Respondents were randomly assigned to a branded or plain pack condition and rated 12 cigarette packages for appeal, taste, harm to health and smoker-image traits. As a behavioral measure of appeal, respondents were offered (although not given) four cigarette packs (either branded or plain) and asked to select one to keep. The findings indicated that branded packs were perceived to be more appealing (β = 3.40, p p plain packs. Participants rated people who smoke the branded packs as having relatively more positive smoker-image traits overall (β = 2.10, p p branded compared with plain packs. These results suggest that plain packaging may reduce brand appeal among Mexican youth, consistent with findings in high-income countries.

Journal Article,Racial attitude (dis)similarity and liking in same-race minority interactions.,"Two studies investigate the relationship between racial attitude (dis)similarity and interpersonal liking for racial minorities and Whites in same-race and cross-race pairs. In nationally representative and local samples, minorities report personally caring about racial issues more than Whites do (Pilot Study), which we theorize makes racial attitude divergence with ingroup members especially disruptive. Both established friendships (Study 1) and face-to-face interactions among strangers (Study 2) provided evidence for the dissimilarity-repulsion hypothesis in same-race interactions for minorities but not Whites. For minorities, disagreeing with a minority partner or friend about racial attitudes decreased their positivity toward that person. Because minorities typically report caring about race more than Whites, same-race friendships involving shared racial attitudes may be particularly critical sources of social support for them, particularly in predominately White contexts. Understanding challenges that arise in same-race interactions, not just cross-race interactions, can help create environments in which same-race minority friendships flourish.

Journal Article,Reinforcing small wins and frustrating near-misses: Further investigation into scratch card gambling.,"Scratch card games are incredibly popular in the Canadian marketplace. However, only recently have researchers started to systematically analyze their structural characteristics and how these in turn affect the gambler. We present two studies designed to further understand the underlying physiological and psychological effects that scratch cards have on gamblers. We had gamblers (63 in Experiment 1, 68 in Experiment 2) play custom made scratch cards involving a small win, a regular loss and a near-miss—where they uncovered two out of the three symbols needed to win the top prize. Our predictions were that despite near-misses and losses being objectively equivalent (the gambler wins nothing) gamblers’ reactions to these outcomes would differ dramatically. During game play, skin conductance levels and heart rate were recorded, as well as how long gamblers paused between each game. Gamblers’ subjective reactions to the different outcomes were then assessed. In both studies, near-misses triggered higher levels of physiological arousal (skin conductance levels and heart rates) than losses. Gamblers paused significantly longer following small wins than other outcomes, and reported high arousal, positive affect and urge to gamble—a constellation of results consistent with their rewarding properties. Importantly near-miss outcomes were rated as highly arousing, negative in emotional tone, and the most frustrating of all three outcome types examined. In Experiment 2, when we measured subjective urge to gamble immediately after each outcome, urge to gamble was significantly higher following near-misses than regular losses. Thus, despite not rewarding the gambler with any monetary gain, these outcomes nevertheless triggered higher arousal and larger urges to gamble than regular losses, a finding that may explain in part, the allure of scratch cards as a gambling activity.

Journal Article,Modeling automation with cognitive work analysis to support human-automation coordination.,"Cognitive work analysis is useful to develop displays for complex situations, but it has not been well explored in providing support for human-automation coordination. To fill this gap, we propose a degree of automation (DOA) layering approach, demonstrated by modeling an automated financial trading domain, with a goal of supporting interface design in this domain. The abstraction hierarchy and the decision ladder each adopted an additional layer, mapping functions allocated to the trader and to the automation. In addition to the mapping, we marked the four stages of automation on the decision ladder to provide guidance on representing the function allocation at the task level. Next, we compared the DOA layering approach to how automation was represented in the cognitive work analysis literature. We found that a DOA-layered decision ladder, which included well-developed knowledge of the stages and levels of automation, can be suited to modern automated systems with different DOAs. This study suggests that the DOA layering approach has important implications for designing automation displays and deciding stages and levels of automation and may be a useful approach for modeling adaptive automation.

Editorial,The maturing of gamification research.,"The editorial briefs about the issues of the gamification research. If the papers collected in this volume share one common trait compared to the first wave of gamification research, it is maturity. Each one in its own way marks a step forward in theoretical considerateness, methodological rigor, and differentiated conclusions. This maturity undoubtedly (hopefully!) owes to the extensive review and revision the articles have undergone since their submission, for which we thank our many reviewers and authors. However, as this volume holds even more papers submitted on an open call following Gamification 2013, it is also indicative of the field as a whole. If the first wave of gamification research was held together by fundamental questions of “what?” and “why?”, the current wave is asking differentiated questions around “how?”, “when?”, and “how and when not?” More specifically, the papers collected here mark a maturation in three research domains: (1) theory-driven empirical studies, (2) design methods, and (3) application areas. Gamification research promises no less than a science of how individual design elements, dimensions, and qualities affect user experience and engagement, with near-limitless applications. But to make good on that promise, we need validated theories how design elements function and interact with individual dispositions, situational circumstances, and the characteristics of particular target activities.

Journal Article,Domains of weak continuity of statistical functionals with a view toward robust statistics.,"Many standard estimators such as several maximum likelihood estimators or the empirical estimator for any law-invariant convex risk measure are not (qualitatively) robust in the classical sense. However, these estimators may nevertheless satisfy a weak robustness property (Krätschmer et al. (2012, 2014)) or a local robustness property (Zähle (2016)) on relevant sets of distributions. One aim of our paper is to identify sets of local robustness, and to explain the benefit of the knowledge of such sets. For instance, we will be able to demonstrate that many maximum likelihood estimators are robust on their natural parametric domains. A second aim consists in extending the general theory of robust estimation to our local framework. In particular we provide a corresponding Hampel-type theorem linking local robustness of a plug-in estimator with a certain continuity condition.

Journal Article,"Recent progress in Alzheimer’s disease research, part 3: Diagnosis and treatment.","The field of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research has grown exponentially over the past few decades, especially since the isolation and identification of amyloid-β from postmortem examination of the brains of AD patients. Recently, the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease (JAD) put forth approximately 300 research reports which were deemed to be the most influential research reports in the field of AD since 2010. JAD readers were asked to vote on these most influential reports. In this 3-part review, we review the results of the 300 most influential AD research reports to provide JAD readers with a readily accessible, yet comprehensive review of the state of contemporary research. Notably, this multi-part review identifies the “hottest” fields of AD research providing guidance for both senior investigators as well as investigators new to the field on what is the most pressing fields within AD research. Part 1 of this review covers pathogenesis, both on a molecular and macro scale. Part 2 review genetics and epidemiology, and part 3 covers diagnosis and treatment. This part of the review, diagnosis and treatment, reviews the latest diagnostic criteria, biomarkers, imaging, and treatments in AD.

Journal Article,Mindfulness and mind wandering: The protective effects of brief meditation in anxious individuals.,"Mind wandering can be costly, especially when we are engaged in attentionally demanding tasks. Preliminary studies suggest that mindfulness can be a promising antidote for mind wandering, albeit the evidence is mixed. To better understand the exact impact of mindfulness on mind wandering, we had a sample of highly anxious undergraduate students complete a sustained-attention task during which off-task thoughts including mind wandering were assessed. Participants were randomly assigned to a meditation or control condition, after which the sustained-attention task was repeated. In general, our results indicate that mindfulness training may only have protective effects on mind wandering for anxious individuals. Meditation prevented the increase of mind wandering over time and ameliorated performance disruption during off-task episodes. In addition, we found that the meditation intervention appeared to promote a switch of attentional focus from the internal to present-moment external world, suggesting important implications for treating worrying in anxious populations.

Journal Article,The role of unregulated care providers in managing heart failure patients in long-term care facilities.,"Aims and objectives: Heart failure is a complex syndrome in which abnormal heart function results in clinical symptoms and signs of low cardiac output and/or pulmonary or systemic congestion. Heart failure is common among long‐term care residents, and is associated with significant morbidity and acute care utilisation. Heart failure guidelines endorse standard therapies, yet long‐term care residents are less likely to receive recommended treatments. The objective of this study is to understand the perceptions and potential role of unregulated care providers in contributing to better heart failure management among long‐term care residents. Design: Focus group interviews. Methods: This qualitative study employed focus groups to explore perceptions from 24 unregulated care providers in three Ontario, Canada long‐term care homes, about barriers to the optimal management of heart failure. Results: Three overarching concepts emerged characterising unregulated care providers’ experiences in caring for residents with heart failure in long‐term care: (1) the complexity of providing heart failure care in a long‐term care setting, (2) striving for resident‐centred decision making and (3) unregulated care providers role enactment nested within an interprofessional team in long‐term care. These concepts reflect the complex interplay between individual unregulated care providers and residents, and heart failure‐related, socio‐cultural and organisational factors that influence heart failure care processes in the long‐term care system. Conclusions: Optimising the management of heart failure in long‐term care is contingent on greater engagement of unregulated care providers as active partners in the interprofessional care team. Interventions to improve heart failure management in long‐term care must ensure that appropriate education is provided to all long‐term care staff, including unregulated care providers, and in a manner that fosters greater and more effective interprofessional collaboration. Relevance to clinical practice: Active and collaborative engagement unregulated care providers has the potential to improve the management of heart failure in long‐term care residents.

Journal Article,Identity change among smokers and ex-smokers: Findings from the ITC Netherlands Survey.,"Successful smoking cessation appears to be facilitated by identity change, that is, when quitting or nonsmoking becomes part of smokers’ and ex-smokers’ self-concepts. The current longitudinal study is the first to examine how identity changes over time among smokers and ex-smokers and whether this can be predicted by socioeconomic status (SES) and psychosocial factors (i.e., attitude, perceived health damage, social norms, stigma, acceptance, self-evaluative emotions, health worries, expected social support). We examined identification with smoking (i.e., smoker self-identity) and quitting (i.e., quitter self-identity) among a large sample of smokers (n = 742) and ex-smokers (n = 201) in a cohort study with yearly measurements between 2009 and 2014. Latent growth curve modeling was used as an advanced statistical technique. As hypothesized, smokers perceived themselves more as smokers and less as quitters than do ex-smokers, and identification with smoking increased over time among smokers and decreased among ex-smokers. Furthermore, psychosocial factors predicted baseline identity and identity development. Socioeconomic status (SES) was particularly important. Specifically, lower SES smokers and lower SES ex-smokers identified more strongly with smoking, and smoker and quitter identities were more resistant to change among lower SES groups. Moreover, stronger proquitting social norms were associated with increasing quitter identities over time among smokers and ex-smokers and with decreasing smoker identities among ex-smokers. Predictors of identity differed between smokers and ex-smokers. Results suggest that SES and proquitting social norms should be taken into account when developing ways to facilitate identity change and, thereby, successful smoking cessation.

Journal,Health systems in an era of biophysical limits: The wicked dilemmas of modernity.,"Modernity is characterized by social complexity, the development of the nation state, disembedded processes of market exchange, an intrinsic logic of growth, increasing throughputs of energy and materials, and an expanding range of environmental impacts. Modern health systems reflect, at every level, the process of ‘disenchantment’ associated with reductive scientific rationality, as well as an ontology of methodological and analytical individualism, which privileges the integrity of the ‘body’ as opposed to networked ‘figurations’ of linked individuals within nested ecological systems. Biophysical limits to growth present a systemic challenge to all aspects of modern society, including health systems. Opportunities for an alternative ‘low-throughput’ health system would center on reconciling wicked dilemmas of modernity, including (1) the increasing vulnerability of high-overhead, materially and energetically intensive global healthcare systems funded through the welfare state in a future defined by ecological limits to economic growth, and (2) the diminishing returns of a curative health system that treats individual human bodies while incurring negative health outcomes at the level of society and ecology.

Journal Article,Measurement of feelings of obligation to volunteer: The Obligation to Volunteer as Commitment (OVC) and Obligation to Volunteer as Duty (OVD) scales.,"While definitions of volunteering centre on the concepts of freedom and choice, in practice volunteering can be imbued with aspects of obligation. This paper describes the development of measures of feelings of obligation to volunteer. As a foundation for scale development, a literature review of feelings of obligation to volunteer suggested two dimensions of obligation: commitment, related to the devotion of volunteers who engage in serious leisure and the rewards that result, and including sub-dimensions of reward, affective attachment, flexibility and side bets; and duty, related to volunteers’ feelings of being burdened by their volunteer pursuits, comprised of the sub-dimensions of expectation, burden and constraint. These two distinct dimensions of obligation to volunteer evolved as two measures in a scale-development process that included review of potential items by subject experts and volunteers, exploratory factor analyses of potential items using data from a student sample and validation of the scale with a volunteer sample.

Journal Article,Tuned by experience: How orientation probability modulates early perceptual processing.,"Probable stimuli are more often and more quickly detected. While stimulus probability is known to affect decision-making, it can also be explained as a perceptual phenomenon. Using spatial gratings, we have previously shown that probable orientations are also more precisely estimated, even while participants remained naive to the manipulation. We conducted an electrophysiological study to investigate the effect that probability has on perception and visual-evoked potentials. In line with previous studies on oddballs and stimulus prevalence, low-probability orientations were associated with a greater late positive ‘P300’ component which might be related to either surprise or decision-making. However, the early ‘C1’ component, thought to reflect V1 processing, was dampened for high-probability orientations while later P1 and N1 components were unaffected. Exploratory analyses revealed a participant-level correlation between C1 and P300 amplitudes, suggesting a link between perceptual processing and decision-making. We discuss how these probability effects could be indicative of sharpening of neurons preferring the probable orientations, due either to perceptual learning, or to feature-based attention.

Journal Article,Development of a physical environmental observational tool for dining environments in long-term care settings.,"Purpose: This paper presents the first standardized physical environmental assessment tool titled Dining Environment Audit Protocol (DEAP) specifically designed for dining spaces in care homes and reports the results of its psychometric properties. Items rated include: adequacy of lighting, glare, personal control, clutter, staff supervision support, restraint use, and seating arrangement option for social interaction. Two scales summarize the prior items and rate the overall homelikeness and functionality of the space. Methods: Ten dining rooms in three long-term care homes were selected for assessment. Data were collected over 11 days across 5 weeks. Two trained assessors completed DEAP independently on the same day. Interrater-reliability was completed for lighting, glare, space, homelike aspects, seating arrangements and the two summary scales, homelikeness and functionality of the space. For categorical measures, measure responses were dichotomized at logical points and Cohen’s Kappa and concordance on ratings were determined. Results: The two overall rating scales on homelikeness and functionality of space were found to be reliable intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (~ 0.7). The mean rating for homelikeness for Assessor 1 was 3.5 (SD 1.35) and for functionality of the room was 5.3. (SD 0.82; median 5.5). Implications: The findings indicate that the tool’s interrater-reliability scores are promising. The high concordance on the overall scores for homelikeness and functionality is indicative of the strength of the individual items in generating a reliable global assessment score on these two important aspects of the dining space.

Journal Article,LGBTQ youth and young adult perspectives on a culturally tailored group smoking cessation program.,"Introduction: The prevalence of smoking among LGBTQ youth and young adults (YYAs) is much higher than that of non-LGBTQ young people. The current study explored LGBTQ YYA perceptions of a culturally tailored group smoking cessation counselling program, along with how the intervention could be improved. Methods: We conducted focus groups (n = 24) with 204 LGBTQ YYAs in Toronto and Ottawa, Canada. Open-ended questions focused on their feelings, likes and dislikes, concerns and additional ideas for a culturally tailored group cessation counselling intervention. Focus group transcripts were coded thematically and analyzed. Results: Overall, YYAs were ambivalent towards the concept of a culturally tailored, group cessation counselling program. Although several participants were attracted to the LGBTQ friendly and social benefits of such a program (eg, good support system), many also had concerns. Particularly, the possibility that other group members might trigger them to smoke was a frequently stated issue. Focus group members also noted lack of motivation to attend the group, and that the group program may be inaccessible depending on where and when the program was offered. Several suggestions were made as to how to ameliorate the expressed issues related to inaccessibility or lack of attractiveness. Conclusions: This study is among the first to gain the perspectives of LGBTQ YYAs on culturally tailored group cessation strategies in Canada. We identified components of group cessation programs that are both favored and not favored among LGBTQ YYAs, as well as suggestions as to how to make group cessation programs more appealing. Implications: This study is particularly relevant as smoking cessation programs are one of the most commonly offered and published cessation interventions for the LGBTQ community, yet little is understood in terms of preferences of LGBTQ YYA smokers. Given the disparity in the prevalence of smoking among LGBTQ young people compared to their non-LGBTQ peers, research on effective intervention strategies for this population is needed. Findings from this study can assist practitioners and researchers in designing interventions.

Journal Article,Socioeconomic attainment of extremely low birth weight survivors: The role of early cognition.,"Objectives: To determine: (1) if childhood cognitive and academic abilities mediate the abstract association between being born at extremely low birth weight (ELBW) and socioeconomic attainment at age 29 to 36 years; (2) which cognitive abilities (IQ, verbal abilities, fluid intelligence, mathematical abilities, or academic achievement) most strongly mediate this association; and (3) if the mediating role of cognition is different in ELBW survivors with significant neurosensory impairment (NSI). Methods: A prospective, longitudinal cohort of 100 Canadian ELBW survivors born between 1977 and 1982 and 89 normal birth weight comparison participants were used to examine the mediating role of childhood cognition by using 5 cognitive mediators assessed at age 8 years (overall IQ, verbal IQ, performance IQ, quantitative ability, and academic achievement) on socioeconomic attainment at adulthood. Socioeconomic attainment was defined as personal annual earnings and full-time employment assessed via self-report at age 29 to 36 years. Results: Mediation models revealed that childhood cognition mediated the association between ELBW status and income attainment, with mathematical abilities and overall IQ each accounting for 26% of the direct effect. Mediated effects were not statistically significant in full-time employment models. For both outcomes, the mediating effect of cognition was stronger for ELBW survivors with NSI. Conclusions: Childhood cognitive abilities partially mediate associations between ELBW status and adult income attainment. Early life cognition is a critical predictor of socioeconomic attainment in ELBW survivors, particularly in those born with NSI. Interventions aimed at enhancing early cognition in ELBW survivors may help optimize their later socioeconomic attainment.

Journal Article,How “ought” exceeds but implies “can”: Description and encouragement in moral judgment.,"This paper tests a theory about the relationship between two important topics in moral philosophy and psychology. One topic is the function of normative language, specifically claims that one “ought” to do something. Do these claims function to describe moral responsibilities, encourage specific behavior, or both? The other topic is the relationship between saying that one “ought” to do something and one’s ability to do it. In what respect, if any, does what one “ought” to do exceed what one “can” do? The theory tested here has two parts: (1) “ought” claims function to both describe responsibilities and encourage people to fulfill them (the dual-function hypothesis); (2) the two functions relate differently to ability, because the encouragement function is limited by the person’s ability, but the descriptive function is not (the interaction hypothesis). If this theory is correct, then in one respect “ought implies can” is false because people have responsibilities that exceed their abilities. But in another respect “ought implies can” is legitimate because it is not worthwhile to encourage people to do things that exceed their ability. Results from two behavioral experiments support the theory that “ought” exceeds but implies “can.” Results from a third experiment provide further evidence regarding an “ought” claim’s primary function and how contextual features can affect the interpretation of its functions.

Journal Article,Asymmetry in gaze direction discrimination between the upper and lower visual fields.,"Previous research has shown that gaze direction can only be accurately discriminated within parafoveal limits (∼ 5° eccentricity) along the horizontal visual field. Beyond this eccentricity, head orientation seems to influence gaze discrimination more than iris cues. The present study examined gaze discrimination performance in the upper visual field (UVF) and lower visual field (LVF), and whether head orientation affects gaze judgments beyond parafoveal vision. Direct and averted gaze faces, in frontal and deviated head orientations, were presented for 150 ms along the vertical meridian while participants maintained central fixation during gaze discrimination judgments. Gaze discrimination was above chance level at all but one eccentricity for the two gaze-head congruent conditions. In contrast, for the incongruent conditions, gaze was discriminated above chance only from – 1.5° to + 3°, with an asymmetry between the UVF and LVF. Beyond foveal vision, response rates were biased toward head orientation rather than iris eccentricity, occurring in the LVF for both head orientations, and in the UVF for frontal head views. These findings suggest that covert processing of gaze direction involves the integration of eyes and head cues, with congruency of these two social cues driving response differences between the LVF and the UVF.

Journal Article,The determinants of service complexity in children with intellectual disabilities.,"Background: To date, little is known about the predictors of healthcare service utilisation in children with intellectual disability (ID). The aim of this study was to identify the factors associated with service complexity in children with ID in Ontario, Canada. Methods: The population of this cross‐sectional study consisted of 330 children with ID ages 4 to 18 years who accessed mental health services from November of 2012 to June of 2016 in four agencies. All participants completed the interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health and Developmental Disability Assessment Instrument, which is a semi‐structured clinician‐rated assessment that covers a range of common issues in children with ID. The outcome of this study was a service complexity variable based on (1) mental health service utilisation including any services provided to the child and (2) the management involved in providing that care. Eight individual items were summed, resulting in a scale that ranged from 0 to 8. Scores were then dichotomised into two groups: a score of 0–2 identified children with a low service complexity and a score of 3 or higher identified children with a high service complexity. Results: After adjustment for other covariates, gender was not associated with service complexity. Children aged 11–14 years and children with autism spectrum disorder used over twofold higher levels of service complexity than children aged equal to or less than 10 years or children with other causes of ID. Moreover, victims of bullying, high scores on the family functioning scale or learning or communication disorder were associated with greater service complexity. Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that a variety of factors are related to service complexity ranged from children's nonclinical (age and experiences of bullying) to clinical (e.g. aggression, learning/communication problems and autism spectrum disorder) characteristics.

As such, understanding boredom and the associated cognitive and affective components of the experience, represents an important first step in combatting the consequences of boredom for psychological well-being. We surveyed 1928 undergraduate students on measures of boredom proneness, self-control, MW, depression and aggression to investigate how these constructs were related. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that self-control operated as a strong negative predictor of boredom proneness. Finally, when controlling for age and self-control, we observed large decreases in the magnitudes of the relationships between boredom proneness and our other measures of interest. Together, these results imply a strong relationship between boredom proneness and cognitive and affective dysregulation, and show that individual levels of self-control can account for the lion’s share of variance in the relationships between boredom, cognition, and affect.

Journal Article,Examining the acute effects of hatha yoga and mindfulness meditation on executive function and mood.,"The objective of this study was to compare the acute effects of hatha yoga and mindfulness meditation on executive function and mood. Using a within-subjects experimental design, 31 moderately experienced hatha yoga practitioners (mean age 27.71 ± 8.32) completed three counterbalanced sessions: hatha yoga (conscious movement and meditation), meditation (mindfulness of breath, emotions, thoughts, and body sensations), and a reading control task. Executive function was assessed using the Stroop task at baseline and at two follow-up points (5 and 10 min post-session). Self-reported mood was measured using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) at baseline and immediately following each session. Findings indicated that hatha yoga (p = .002) and meditation (p = .044) both resulted in significantly improved Stroop performance, though the two conditions did not differ significantly from each other (p = .728). The cognitive benefits in both cases were evident at the 10-min post-session delay but not at the 5-min post-session delay. With respect to mood outcomes, hatha yoga (p p = .050) both resulted in significantly improved POMS total mood scores. Hatha yoga and meditation did not differ significantly from each other in regard to POMS total mood (p = .079), though hatha yoga showed significantly greater benefits on the vigor-activity subscale (p = .006). Overall, findings suggest that acute bouts of hatha yoga and mindfulness meditation benefit executive function and mood to a similar degree.

Journal Article,The intergenerational transmission of perfectionism: Fathers' other-oriented perfectionism and daughters' perceived psychological control uniquely predict daughters' self-critical and personal standards perfectionism.,"An often theorized but seldom tested possibility is perfectionism is traceable to parents who demanded perfection (other-oriented perfectionism) and parents who used controlling behaviors to dictate a child's thoughts, feelings, and actions (psychological control). In support, perceived parental psychological control correlates positively with self-critical perfectionism and personal standards perfectionism. Nevertheless, there remains much to learn. Does other-oriented perfectionism in fathers influence self-critical perfectionism and personal standards perfectionism in daughters? Alternatively, might the theoretically plausible link between fathers' other-oriented perfectionism and daughters' self-critical and personal standards perfectionism simply be secondary to paternal psychological control? We answered these important questions by studying 159 father-daughter dyads. Fathers completed measures of paternal psychological control and other-oriented perfectionism. Daughters completed measures of perceived paternal psychological control, self-critical perfectionism, and personal standards perfectionism. Structural equation modeling revealed both fathers' other-oriented perfectionism and daughters' reports of fathers' psychological control uniquely predicted daughters' self-critical perfectionism and daughters' personal standards perfectionism. Findings lend credence to longstanding theoretical accounts suggesting controlling fathers who demand perfection are more likely to raise daughters with elevated socially-based and self-generated pressures to be perfect.

Journal Article,Indigenous families: Who do you call family?,"Although commonly perceived as a typical family type in western society, the nuclear family structure may not resonate with other cultures, including Indigenous populations. This study explored the conceptualization of Indigenous families in Canada. 15 Indigenous and non-Indigenous people participated in semi-structured interviews. Findings revealed that the perception of Indigenous family may be framed through a personal or institutional perspective. At the personal level, the perception of an Indigenous family was influenced by culture, specifically social ties, language, childrearing practices, and residential location. At the institutional level, the perception of an Indigenous family was defined through demographic or legal terms, and influenced by temporal change, though generally through a non-Indigenous lens. These findings suggest that current (standard) western definitions of the family may not accurately represent Indigenous families; cultural influences need to be taken into consideration. However, institutional definitions of family may serve specific purposes.

Journal Article,Human dorsomedial parieto-motor circuit specifies grasp during the planning of goal-directed hand actions.,"According to one influential view, two specialized parieto-frontal circuits control prehension: a dorsomedial stream for hand transport during reaching and a dorsolateral stream for preshaping the fingers during grasping. However, recent evidence argues that an area within the dorsomedial stream–macaque area V6A and, its putative human homolog, superior parietal occipital cortex (SPOC)—encodes both hand transport and grip formation. We tested whether planning varied hand actions modulates functional connectivity between left SPOC and ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) using a dual-site, paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm with two coils (dsTMS). Participants performed three different hand actions to a target object comprising a small cylinder atop a larger cylinder. These actions were: reaching-to-grasp the top (GT) using a precision grip, reaching-to-grasp the bottom (GB) using a whole-hand grip, or reaching-to-touch (Touch) the side of the target object without forming a grip. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from TMS to M1, with or without preceding TMS to SPOC, were recorded from first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) hand muscles in two experiments that varied timing parameters (the stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA, between the ‘GO’ cue and stimulation and interpulse interval, IPI, between SPOC and M1 stimulation). We found that preparatory response amplitudes in the SPOC-M1 circuit of different hand muscles were selectively modulated early in the motor plan for different types of grasps. First, based on SPOC-M1 interactions, across two experiments, the role of the ADM was facilitated during a whole-hand grasp of a large object (GB) relative to other conditions under certain timing parameters (SOA = 150 msec; IPI = 6 msec). Second, the role of the FDI was facilitated during hand action planning compared to rest. These findings suggest that the human dorsomedial parieto-motor stream plays a causal role in planning grip formation for object-directed actions.

Journal Article,A neural model of hierarchical reinforcement learning.,"We develop a novel, biologically detailed neural model of reinforcement learning (RL) processes in the brain. This model incorporates a broad range of biological features that pose challenges to neural RL, such as temporally extended action sequences, continuous environments involving unknown time delays, and noisy/imprecise computations. Most significantly, we expand the model into the realm of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), which divides the RL process into a hierarchy of actions at different levels of abstraction. Here we implement all the major components of HRL in a neural model that captures a variety of known anatomical and physiological properties of the brain. We demonstrate the performance of the model in a range of different environments, in order to emphasize the aim of understanding the brain's general reinforcement learning ability. These results show that the model compares well to previous modelling work and demonstrates improved performance as a result of its hierarchical ability. We also show that the model's behaviour is consistent with available data on human hierarchical RL, and generate several novel predictions.

Journal Article,Prevalence and correlates of the belief that electronic cigarettes are a lot less harmful than conventional cigarettes under the different regulatory environments of Australia and the United Kingdom.,"Introduction: The rapid rise in electronic cigarettes (ECs) globally has stimulated much debate about the relative risk and public health impact of this new emerging product category as compared to conventional cigarettes. The sale and marketing of ECs containing nicotine are banned in many countries (eg, Australia) but are allowed in others (eg, United Kingdom). This study examined prevalence and correlates of the belief that ECs are a lot less harmful than conventional cigarettes under the different regulatory environments in Australia (ie, more restrictive) and the United Kingdom (ie, less restrictive). Methods: Australian and UK data from the 2013 survey of the International Tobacco Control Four-Country project were analyzed. Results: More UK than Australian respondents (58.5% vs. 35.2%) believed that ECs are a lot less harmful than conventional cigarettes but more respondents in Australia than in the United Kingdom selected “Don’t Know” (36.5% vs. 17.1%). The proportion that responded “A little less, equally or more harmful” did not differ between countries. Correlates of the belief that ECs are “A lot less harmful” differed between countries, while correlates of “Don’t Know” response did not differ. Conclusions: Consistent with the less restrictive regulatory environment affecting the sale and marketing of ECs, smokers and recent ex-smokers in the United Kingdom were more likely to believe ECs were less harmful relative to conventional cigarettes compared to those in Australia. Implications: What this study adds: Among smokers and ex-smokers, this study found that the belief that ECs are (a lot) less harmful than conventional cigarettes was considerably higher in the United Kingdom than in Australia in 2013. The finding is consistent with the less restrictive regulatory environment for ECs in the United Kingdom, suggesting that the regulatory framework for ECs adopted by a country can affect smokers’ perceptions about the relative harmfulness of ECs, the group that stands to gain the most from having an accurate belief about the relative harms of ECs.

Comment/Reply,Developing consistent and transparent models of e-cigarette use: Reply to Glantz and Soneji et al.,"Replies to the comments made by Samir Soneji et al. (see record 2017-30934-018) and Stanton A. Glantz (see record 2017-30934-019) on the authors' original article (see record 2017-30934-003). In that article, the authors applied a framework and the most recent, nationally representative data to make public health projections for a single cohort. Glantz has claimed that Kalkhoran and Glantz (K&G) are using the appropriate data to model e-cigarette trends, whereas the author's model is ad hoc. A careful examination of the K&G model reveals that they are using data on ever use to characterize both initial use and regular use. The authors agree with Soneji et al. that validation is important, but disagree that the appropriate data are now available to allow reliable validation. Soneji et al. inappropriately compared the NHIS 18-year-old cigarette smoking prevalence to the level in the author's counterfactual. However, the authors based the counterfactual on data from 2012 and earlier in order to project what would have occurred in the absence of e-cigarettes. The authors appreciate the time and effort that others have taken to review the model and discuss strengths and weaknesses. They believe the model represents a fair and balanced effort to apply a comprehensive framework to estimating the impact of e-cigarettes on public health using the best evidence now available—and as new and more reliable data become available, the model can readily be modified to produce updated estimates of the impact of e-cigarettes on important public health outcomes.

Journal Article,Impact of self-reported lifetime depression or anxiety on effectiveness of mass distribution of nicotine patches.,"Background: Large-scale public health initiatives providing free nicotine replacement therapy have been shown to increase smoking cessation rates; however, their effectiveness among the highly prevalent population of smokers with depression and anxiety disorders has not been explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of lifetime history of depression or anxiety on smoking cessation success following the free distribution of nicotine patches. Method: In the context of a randomised controlled trial, a secondary analysis was conducted on 1000 adult regular smokers randomised to be mailed a 5-week supply of nicotine patches or to a no intervention control group. Participants were divided into subgroups based on the presence of self-reported lifetime diagnosis of depression and anxiety. Results: Irrespective of self-reported lifetime history of depression or anxiety, odds of self-reported cessation at 6 months were significantly greater among groups receiving nicotine patches compared to no intervention control (no history of depression or anxiety: OR 2.20; 95% CI 1.05 to 4.63; history of depression or anxiety present: OR 3.90; 95% CI 1.28 to 11.88). Among nicotine patch recipients only, quit outcomes did not differ between those with and without self-reported lifetime depression or anxiety in models unadjusted and adjusted for differences in demographic and smoking characteristics. Conclusions: The mass distribution of free nicotine patches (without behavioural support) is effective among smokers with or without lifetime history of depression or anxiety alike, providing further support for the adoption of similar initiatives as a means of promoting tobacco cessation on a population level.

Journal Article,The salience of the self: Self‐referential processing and internalizing problems in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder.,"Children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate atypical processing of, and memory for, self‐referenced information, which may contribute to the heightened rates of co‐occurring internalizing problems. We assessed affective and cognitive aspects of self‐referential processing in verbally‐fluent children with ASD (N = 79), and an age‐matched comparison sample (COM, N = 73) of children without an autism diagnosis. We examined group differences in these two aspects of the self‐system, and their joint contributions to individual differnces in internalizing problems. Using a self‐referenced memory (SRM) task, participants indicated whether a series of positive and negative trait adjectives described themselves and a well‐known fictional character. Participants were then surprised with a recognition memory test on the same adjectives. Overall, individuals with ASD showed a reduction in the extent to which they preferentially endorsed positive over negative trait adjectives about themselves, and a reduction in their preferential memory for self‐ over other‐referenced information. Across the full sample, these two aspects of self‐referential processing jointly predicted self‐reported internalizing problems. Specifically, self‐evaluations were strongly and inversely associated with internalizing problems but only for children with relatively high SRM. These findings suggest that the salience of the self influences the extent to which affective self‐evaluations impact emotional functioning for youth both with and without ASD. Implications for basic (e.g., developmental) and translational (e.g., intervention) research are discussed.

The purpose of this study is to compare the work practices of the two professions and examine (1) how IEs and ergonomists gain influence over workplace changes and (2) whether there are prevailing types of intentional interaction behaviours called Power bases (PB) present in the interaction tactics they employ. The study identified key behavioural strategies used by the interviewees to successfully influence workplace changes; these were then mapped to their corresponding PB. Results showed that IEs and ergonomists were successfully influencing workplace changes using several tactics across the spectrum of PB, with the exception of Reward and Coercion. The study concludes with a list of recommended workplace change agent tactics, and proposes that a PB ‘analytical lens’ can serve to increase the budding ergonomists’ critical and analytical skills when considering possible workplace change tactics.

Journal Article,The neurocognitive consequences of sleep restriction: A meta-analytic review.,"The current meta-analytic review evaluated the effects of experimentally manipulated sleep restriction on neurocognitive functioning. Random-effects models were employed to estimate the overall effect size and the differential effect size across cognitive domains. Age, time of day, age-adjusted sleep deficit, cumulative days of restricted sleep, sleep latency, subjective sleepiness, and biological sex were examined as potential moderators of the effect. Based on a sample of 61 studies, from 71 different populations, findings revealed a significant negative effect of sleep restriction on cognitive processing across cognitive domains (g = −0.383, p g = −0.324, p g = −0.409, p g = −0.192, p = 0.002). There was insufficient evidence to detect an effect within the domains of attention, multitask, impulsive decision-making or intelligence. Age group, time of day, cumulative days of restricted sleep, sleep latency, subjective sleepiness, and biological sex were all significant moderators of the overall effect. In conclusion, the current meta-analysis is the first comprehensive review to provide evidence that short-term sleep restriction significantly impairs waking neurocognitive functioning.

Journal Article,A systematic review on community-based interventions for elder abuse and neglect.,"Elder abuse and neglect is a societal issue that requires prevention and intervention strategies at the practice and policy level. A systematic review on the efficacy of community-based elder abuse interventions was undertaken to advance the state of knowledge in the field. The peer-reviewed literature between 2009 and December 2015 were searched across four databases. Two raters independently reviewed all articles, assessed their methodological quality, and used a modified Sackett Scale to assign levels of evidence. Four thousand nine hundred and five articles were identified; nine were selected for inclusion. Although there was Level-1 evidence for psychological interventions (n = 2), only one study on strategies for relatives (START) led to a reported decrease in elder abuse. There was Level-4 evidence for conservatorship, an elder abuse intervention/prevention program (ECARE), and a multidisciplinary intervention (n = 4), in which one study yielded significant decreases in elder abuse and/or neglect. The remaining three were classified as Level-5 evidence (n = 3) for elder mediation and multidisciplinary interventions. There are limited studies with high levels of evidence for interventions that decrease elder abuse and neglect. The scarcity of community-based interventions for older adults and caregivers highlights the need for further work to elevate the quality of studies.

Journal Article,Association between antidepressants and fall-related injuries among long-term care residents.,"Objectives: Antidepressants are associated with an increased risk of falls although little is known of the comparative risks of different types of antidepressants or individuals who are at greatest risk for falls. We examined the association between new use of antidepressants and fall-related injuries among older adults in long-term care (LTC). Design, Setting, Participants: This was a matched, retrospective cohort study involving LTC residents in Ontario, Canada, from 2008 to 2014. New users of antidepressants were matched to non-users of antidepressants. Measurements: The primary outcome was any fall resulting in an emergency department (ED) visit or hospitalization within 90 days after exposure. Secondary outcomes included hip fractures, wrist fractures, and falls reported in LTC. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval associated with antidepressants and outcomes. Results: New users of any antidepressant had an increased risk of ED visits or hospitalization for falls within 90 days when compared with individuals not receiving antidepressants (5.2% versus 2.8%; adjusted OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.7–2.2). Antidepressants were also associated with an increased risk of all secondary outcomes. The increased risk of fall-related injuries was evident among selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, trazodone, and across multiple patient subgroups. Conclusions: New use of antidepressants is associated with significantly increased risk of falls and fall-related injuries among LTC residents across different patient subgroups and antidepressant classes. The potential risk of fall-related outcomes should be carefully considered when initiating antidepressants among older adults in LTC.

Journal Article,Perceptions and knowledge of caffeinated energy drinks: Results of focus groups with Canadian youth.,"Objective: To examine use, knowledge, and perceptions of caffeinated energy drinks (CEDs) among youth. Design: Qualitative research using focus group discussions (n = 4). Setting: Two Canadian cities (Toronto and Montreal). Participants: Youth aged 12–18 years (n = 41). Phenomenon of Interest: Perceived definitions of CEDs, reasons for use, knowledge of health effects, use with alcohol, marketing perceptions, and use and understanding of cautionary statements on packaging. Analysis: Data were analyzed using a modified grounded-theory approach. Results: Youth identified CEDs as products that provide energy and contain caffeine and sugar. Compared with mainstream CED brands and energy shots, youth were less likely to perceive Gatorade, Coca-Cola, and a Starbucks beverage as energy drinks, despite some ambiguity. The majority of participants believed that CEDs, including mixed with alcohol, were not necessarily harmful in moderation and that marketing was targeted toward older youth and young adults. Awareness of cautionary statements on CEDs was low; cautionary statements were perceived as difficult to find and read owing to the design and small font. Conclusions and Implications: Findings suggest a need to increase public education regarding the potential risks of CED consumption, including enhancements to the mandated cautionary statements, with greater attention to the impact of CED marketing on youth.

Journal Article,Visuo-haptic integration in object identification using novel objects.,"Although some studies have shown that haptic and visual identification seem to rely on similar processes, few studies have directly compared the two. We investigated haptic and visual object identification by asking participants to learn to recognize (Experiments 1, and 3), or to match (Experiment 2) novel objects that varied only in shape. Participants explored objects haptically, visually, or bimodally, and were then asked to identify objects haptically and/or visually. We demonstrated that patterns of identification errors were similar across identification modality, independently of learning and testing condition, suggesting that the haptic and visual representations in memory were similar. We also demonstrated that identification performance depended on both learning and testing conditions: visual identification surpassed haptic identification only when participants explored the objects visually or bimodally. When participants explored the objects haptically, haptic and visual identification were equivalent. Interestingly, when participants were simultaneously presented with two objects (one was presented haptically, and one was presented visually), object similarity only influenced performance when participants were asked to indicate whether the two objects were the same, or when participants had learned about the objects visually—without any haptic input. The results suggest that haptic and visual object representations rely on similar processes, that they may be shared, and that visual processing may not always lead to the best performance.

Journal Article,Controlling the unruly maternal body: Losing and gaining control over the body during pregnancy and the postpartum period.,"This paper examines the feeling of lost control of the body that so many women experience through pregnancy and the postpartum period—why they feel it and how they interpret that feeling—and women's responses to the sense of lost control. For the 63 Canadian women we interviewed, the sense of lost control was related to the degree they felt their bodies changed and the number of physical problems they experienced while pregnant. Many women's references to “luck” as the cause of body changes and problems experienced underscored how little control they felt they had when they were pregnant. At the same time, women felt responsible for the well-being of their babies, and thus experienced guilt about their unruly bodies. Careful attention to diet helped some women, but not others, regain some sense of control; women with past experience of pregnancy who “gave in” to body change were more sanguine. In the postpartum period, body work (especially exercise) functioned to increase women's sense of control, but a variety of motives led them to do this work.

Journal Article,Reading aloud: On the determinants of the joint effects of stimulus quality and word frequency.,"There are multiple reports, in the context of the time taken to read aloud, that the joint effects of stimulus quality and word frequency (a) interact when only words appear in the list but (b) are additive when nonwords are intermixed with words (O’Malley & Besner, 2008). This triple interaction has been explained in terms of the idea that different processing modes are in play in these different contexts. Processing is cascaded when only words appear in the list, allowing the effect of stimulus quality to influence the downstream process(es) affected by word frequency. In contrast, when nonwords appear in the list an early process affected by stimulus quality, but not word frequency, is staged (thresholded) so as to reduce the probability of lexicalizations (reading a nonword as a word) when stimulus quality is low. The present experiment addresses the issue of whether such thresholding in the presence of nonwords is driven by the orthography or phonology of the nonwords included in the stimulus set. Participants read words aloud that varied in word frequency and were randomly intermixed with nonwords that all sounded identical to words (e.g., BRANE for BRAIN). Stimulus quality and word frequency had additive effects on the time to read aloud in this context, consistent with the view that it is the orthography of the nonwords that matters. Other aspects of the results suggest that between level feed-back is in play when this particular kind of nonword is used.

Journal Article,Inducing honest reporting of private information in the presence of social projection.,"We discuss payment structures that induce honest reporting of private information by risk-neutral agents in settings involving multiple-choice questions. Such payment structures do not rely on the existence of ground-truth answers, but instead they rely on the assumption that agents exhibit social projection. Social projection is a strong form of the well-known psychological phenomenon called the false-consensus effect, where an agent believes that his private answer to a multiple-choice question is the most popular answer. From a theoretical perspective, we first show that when social projection holds true, honest reporting strictly maximizes an agent’s expected reward from a payment structure that simply compares agents’ reported answers and rewards agreements. Furthermore, we suggest how to induce honest reporting by taking the distance between reported answers into account when social projection is strong, i. e., when an agent believes that his private answer is more likely to be reported by a random peer than all the other answers combined. We also discuss how to derive the above results in terms of proper scoring rules. From an empirical perspective, we investigate the consequences of using a payment structure that rewards agreements in a content-analysis experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We obtain some evidence that, under such a payment structure, agents report more accurate answers than when there are no direct incentives for honest reporting of private answers. Moreover, we find that priming agents by briefly mentioning the theoretical properties of the underlying payment structure results in even more accurate answers.

Journal Article,“One nation under God”: The system‐justifying function of symbolically aligning god and government.,"Do references to God in political discourse increase confidence in the U.S. sociopolitical system? Using a system justification framework (Jost & Banaji, ), five studies provide evidence that, (1) increasingly governments symbolically associate the nation with God when public confidence in the social system may be threatened and (2) associating the nation with God serves a system‐justifying function by increasing public confidence in the system. In an analysis of U.S. presidential speeches, presidents were more likely to symbolically associate the nation with God during threatening times (Study 1). Among religious individuals, referencing God in political rhetoric increased the perceived trustworthiness of politicians, compared to patriotic secular rhetoric (Study 2) or simply priming the concept of God (Study 3). These effects were also unique to politicians from one's own sociopolitical system (Study 4). Finally, believing God has a plan for the United States attenuates the deleterious effect that perceptions of national decline have on system confidence (Study 5). Implications for the system‐justifying function of religion are discussed.

Journal Article,Learning terms and definitions: Drawing and the role of elaborative encoding.,"Traditionally, students adopt the strategy of taking written notes when attending a class or learning from a textbook in educational settings. Informed by previous work showing that learning by doing improves memory performance, we examined whether drawing to-be-remembered definitions from university textbooks would improve later memory, relative to a more typical strategy of rote transcription. Participants were asked to either write out the definition, or to draw a picture representative of the definition. Results indicated that drawing, relative to verbatim writing, conferred a reliable memorial benefit that was robust, even when participants' preexisting familiarity with the terms was included as a covariate (in Experiment 1) or when the to-be-remembered terms and definitions were fictitious, thus removing the influence of familiarity (in Experiment 2). We reasoned that drawing likely facilitates retention at least in part because at encoding, participants must retain and elaborate upon information regarding the meaning of the definition, to translate it into a new form (a picture). This is not the case when participants write out the definitions verbatim. In Experiment 3 we showed that paraphrasing during encoding, which, like drawing and in contrast with verbatim writing, requires self-generated elaboration, led to memory performance that was comparable to drawing. Taken together, results suggest that drawing is a powerful tool which improves memory, and that drawing produces a similar level of retention as does paraphrasing. This suggests that elaborative encoding plays a critical role in the memorial benefit that drawing confers to memory for definitions of academic terms.

We compared retirement planning perceptions of these adults with heterosexual adults and examined the potential role of social support. There were no significant differences between sexual minorities and heterosexual adults regarding their expected retirement age, certainty of retirement age, and anticipated income adequacy in retirement, and higher levels of perceived support were associated with younger anticipated retirement age and greater certainty in retirement planning perceptions. Perceived support also had a stronger association with retirement planning perceptions for sexual minority adults compared to heterosexuals, such that lower perceived support was associated with a later retirement age and less certainty about retirement age, and lower levels of perceived support were linked to diminished anticipated retirement income adequacy for sexual minority adults.

Journal Article,The first letter position effect in visual word recognition: The role of spatial attention.,"A prominent question in visual word recognition is whether letters within a word are processed in parallel or in a left to right sequence. Although most contemporary models posit parallel processing, this notion seems at odds with well-established serial position effects in word identification that indicate preferential processing for the initial letter. The present study reports 4 experiments designed to further probe the locus of the first position processing advantage. The paradigm involved masked target words presented for short durations and required participants to subsequently select from 2 alternatives, 1 which was identical to the target and 1 that differed by a single letter. Experiment 1 manipulated the case between the target and the alternatives to ensure that previous evidence for a first position effect was not due to simple perceptual matching. The results continued to yield a robust first position advantage. Experiment 2 attempted to eliminate postperceptual decision processes as the explanatory mechanism by presenting single letters as targets and requiring participants to select an entire word that contained the target letter at different positions. Here the first position advantage was eliminated, suggesting postperceptual decision processes do not underlie the effect. The final 2 experiments presented masked stimuli either all vertically (Experiment 3) or randomly intermixed vertical and horizontal orientation (Experiment 4). In both cases, a robust first position advantage was still obtained. The authors consider alternative interpretations of this effect and suggest that these results are consistent with a rapid deployment of spatial attention to the beginning of a target string which occurs poststimulus onset.

Although the performance of both genders improved with experience, the gender gap persisted, with males outperforming females across all experience levels. A confirmatory structural equation model assessing the degree to which cognitive ability, thinking dispositions, and gender account for statistical reasoning performance supported the idea that differences in statistical reasoning are not uniquely a matter of cognitive ability.

Journal Article,Prevalence of convergence insufficiency-type symptomatology in Parkinson’s disease.,"Background: Individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) often present with visual symptoms (e.g., difficulty in reading, double vision) that can also be found in convergence insufficiency (CI). Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of CI-type visual symptomatology in individuals with PD, in comparison with controls. Methods: Participants ≥ 50 years with (n = 300) and without (n = 300) PD were recruited. They were administered the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS–15) over the phone. A score of ≥ 21 on the CISS–15, considered positive for CI-type symptomatology, served as the cutoff. Data from individuals (n = 87 with, n = 94 without PD) who were approached but who reported having a known oculovisual condition were analysed separately. Student’s t test and chi-square at the 0.05 level were employed for statistical significance. Results: A total of 29.3% of participants with versus 7.3% without PD presented with a score of ≥ 21 on the CISS–15 (p = 0.001). Of the participants having a known oculovisual condition, 39.1% with versus 19.1% without PD presented with a score of ≥ 21 on the CISS–15 (p = 0.01). Conclusions: The prevalence of CI-type visual symptoms is higher in individuals with versus without PD whether or not they have a coexisting oculovisual condition. These results suggest that PD per se places individuals with the disease at greater risk of visual symptomatology. These results further underline the importance of providing regular eye exams for individuals with PD.

Journal Article,Cultural change: The how and the why.,"More than half a century of cross-cultural research has demonstrated group-level differences in psychological and behavioral phenomena, from values to attention to neural responses. However, cultures are not static, with several specific changes documented for cultural products, practices, and values. How and why do societies change? Here we juxtapose theory and insights from cultural evolution and social ecology. Evolutionary approaches enable an understanding of the how of cultural change, suggesting transmission mechanisms by which the contents of culture may change. Ecological approaches provide insights into the why of cultural change: They identify specific environmental pressures, which evoke shifts in psychology and thereby enable greater precision in predictions of specific cultural changes based on changes in ecological conditions. Complementary insights from the ecological and cultural evolutionary approaches can jointly clarify the process by which cultures change. We end by discussing the relevance of cultural change research for the contemporary societal shifts and by highlighting several critical challenges and future directions for the emerging field of cross-temporal research on culture and psychology.

Journal Article,Evaluating effort: Influences of evaluation mode on judgments of task‐specific efforts.,"The claim that humans adapt their actions in ways that avoid effortful processing (whether cognitive or physical) is a staple of various theories of human behavior. Although much work has been carried out focusing on the determinants of such behaviors, less attention has been given to how individuals evaluate effort. In the current set of experiments, we utilized the general evaluability theory to examine the evaluability of effort by examining subjective value functions across different evaluation modes. Individuals judged the anticipated effort of four task‐specific efforts indexed by stimulus rotation, items to be remembered, weight to be lifted, and stimulus degradation across joint (i.e., judged comparatively) and single evaluation modes (i.e., judged in isolation). General evaluability theory hypothesizes that highly evaluable attributes should be consistently evaluated (i.e., demonstrate similar subjective value functions) between the two modes. Across six experiments, we demonstrate that the perceived effort associated with items to be remembered, weight to be lifted, and stimulus degradation can be considered relatively evaluable, while the effort associated with stimulus rotation may be relatively inevaluable. Results are discussed within the context of subjective evaluation, internal reference information, and strategy selection. In addition, methodological implications of evaluation modes are considered.

Journal Article,Influence of dual-tasking with different levels of attention diversion on characteristics of the movement-related cortical potential.,"Dual tasking is defined as performing two tasks concurrently and has been shown to have a significant effect on attention directed to the performance of the main task. In this study, an attention diversion task with two different levels was administered while participants had to complete a cue-based motor task consisting of foot dorsiflexion. An auditory oddball task with two levels of complexity was implemented to divert the user’s attention. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were made from nine single channels. Event-related potentials (ERPs) confirmed that the oddball task of counting a sequence of two tones decreased the auditory P300 amplitude more than the oddball task of counting one target tone among three different tones. Pre-movement features quantified from the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) were changed significantly between single and dual-task conditions in motor and fronto-central channels. There was a significant delay in movement detection for the case of single tone counting in two motor channels only (237.1–247.4 ms). For the task of sequence counting, motor cortex and frontal channels showed a significant delay in MRCP detection (232.1–250.5 ms). This study investigated the effect of attention diversion in dual-task conditions by analysing both ERPs and MRCPs in single channels. The higher attention diversion lead to a significant reduction in specific MRCP features of the motor task. These results suggest that attention division in dual-tasking situations plays an important role in movement execution and detection. This has important implications in designing real-time brain-computer interface systems.

Journal Article,The effect of type of afferent feedback timed with motor imagery on the induction of cortical plasticity.,"A peripherally generated afferent volley that arrives at the peak negative (PN) phase during the movement related cortical potential (MRCP) induces significant plasticity at the cortical level in healthy individuals and chronic stroke patients. Transferring this type of associative brain-computer interface (BCI) intervention into the clinical setting requires that the proprioceptive input is comparable to the techniques implemented during the rehabilitation process. These consist mainly of functional electrical stimulation (FES) and passive movement induced by an actuated orthosis. In this study, we compared these two interventions (BCIFES and BCIpassive) where the afferent input was timed to arrive at the motor cortex during the PN of the MRCP. Twelve healthy participants attended two experimental sessions. They were asked to perform 30 dorsiflexion movements timed to a cue while continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) data were collected from FP1, Fz, FC1, FC2, C3, Cz, C4, CP1, CP2, and Pz, according to the standard international 10-20 system. MRCPs were extracted and the PN time calculated. Next, participants were asked to imagine the same movement 30 times while either FES (frequency: 20Hz, intensity: 8–35mAmp) or a passive ankle movement (amplitude and velocity matched to a normal gait cycle) was applied such that the first afferent inflow would coincide with the PN of the MRCP. The change in the output of the primary motor cortex (M1) was quantified by applying single transcranial magnetic stimuli to the area of M1 controlling the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle and measuring the motor evoked potential (MEP). Spinal changes were assessed pre and post by eliciting the TA stretch reflex. Both BCIFES and BCIpassive led to significant increases in the excitability of the cortical projections to TA (F (2,22) = 4.44, p = 0.024) without any concomitant changes at the spinal level. These effects were still present 30min after the cessation of both interventions. There was no significant main effect of intervention, F (1,11) = 0.38, p = 0.550, indicating that the changes in MEP occurred independently of the type of afferent inflow. An afferent volley generated from a passive movement or an electrical stimulus arrives at the somatosensory cortex at similar times. It is thus likely that the similar effects observed here are strictly due to the tight coupling in time between the afferent inflow and the PN of the MRCP. This provides further support to the associative nature of the proposed BCI system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","Mrachacz-Kersting, N.;Voigt, M.;Stevenson, A. J.

Journal Article,Academic success of “tiger cubs”: Self-control (not IQ) predicts academic growth and explains girls’ edge in Taiwan.,"Studies in the United States have shown that self-control can predict academic performance beyond intelligence quotient (IQ), which also explains why girls (vs. boys) tend to have higher grades. However, empirical evidence is scarce; moreover, little is known about whether these effects generalize to other cultures. To address these limitations, we conducted a 2-year longitudinal study in Asia and examined the effects of self-control, IQ, and gender on students’ academic achievement over time. Specifically, we first measured 195 Taiwanese seventh grades’ self-control and IQ, and then traced their overall grades over four school semesters. Latent growth curve model analyses suggest that IQ predicted students’ initial academic performance more strongly than self-control; however, self-control—but not IQ—predicted students’ academic growth across the four time points and explained girls’ higher grades. Overall, the findings support the argument that self-control has unique long-term benefits academically and provide initial evidence outside of the North American context.

Journal Article,Predicting intention to volunteer for mega-sport events in China: The case of Universiade event volunteers.,"Attracting and retaining a loyal base of volunteers is critical to the success of mega-sport events (MSEs). The purpose of this study was to examine the antecedents of MSE volunteering in a Chinese context. Drawing upon self-determination theory, the study establishes a valid structural equation model of antecedents of Chinese volunteers’ satisfaction and their intention to volunteer in future MSEs. The XXVI Summer Universiade provides a case-specific context. After a pilot study to validate questionnaire items, location-based convenience sampling was employed to collect data from Universiade volunteers. A total of 1,015 questionnaires were completed and analyzed. Results from the covariance-based structural equation modeling analysis showed that all of the three exogenous factors—external attractiveness, altruism, and intrinsic motivation—emerged as significant predictors of volunteer satisfaction. In turn, volunteers’ perceived level of satisfaction predicted future MSE volunteer intention. Our findings reveal unique differences between Chinese sport event volunteers and their Western counterparts. Implications for event planning and volunteer program design are discussed.

Journal Article,Young children’s understanding of the limits and benefits of group ownership.,"Group ownership is ubiquitous—property is owned by countries, corporations, families, and clubs. However, people cannot understand group ownership by simply relying on their conceptions of ownership by individuals, as group ownership is subject to complexities that do not arise when property is individually owned. We report 6 experiments investigating whether children ages 3 to 6 (N = 540) understand group ownership. In Experiments 1 and 2 children were asked who different objects belong to, and they appropriately judged that certain objects are more likely to belong to a group than to individual people. Experiments 3 and 4 investigated whether children understand the limits of group ownership. Children saw vignettes where agents modified or depleted property. Children ages 3 and older understood that individual members of a group should not deplete group-owned property, and children ages 5 and 6 understood that individual members should not modify group-owned property. Finally, Experiments 5 and 6 investigated whether children understand the benefits of group ownership. Children ages 5 and 6 judged that it is more acceptable for a group member to take group property than for a nonmember to do this, and children ages 4 to 6 judged that group members can take more group resources than can nonmembers. Together, these results are informative about how children conceive of group ownership rights, and about children’s conceptions of groups.

Journal Article,Managing social media during a crisis: A conundrum for event managers.,"In August 2013, Northern Ireland hosted the World Police and Fire Games. The official event evaluation found that the games projected Northern Ireland in a positive light; however, this survey does not tell the full story. Leading up to this event Northern Ireland experienced 4 months of civil unrest. Many consumers turned to social media to seek reassurance and guidance. However, the event organizers did not provide such support during this crisis. In fact, by mismanaging concerns regarding political stability and visitor safety, this event in effect reinforced the negative stereotypical images of Northern Ireland and because it happened online, it was ignored in the official event evaluation. The two key lessons event organizers can learn from this case study are do not underestimate the power of social media, especially in a time of crisis, and in this digital age an event must have a social media strategy that has the flexibility to deal with a crisis.

Journal Article,"The use of Facebook for information seeking, decision support, and self-organization following a significant disaster.","The wide-spread proliferation of the Internet has revolutionized the ways that individuals obtain, interpret, and respond to information in the aftermath of disaster. An F3 tornado that impacted the community of Goderich, Ontario, on 21 August 2011 provided the opportunity to examine how people utilized Facebook and Facebook groups to seek out information, self-organize, and provide support. This mixed-methods project was conducted in two phases. First, semi-structured interviews (n = 35) were conducted with Goderich area residents on their experiences using social media after the tornado. Next, all of the publicly available posts and replies on the Goderich Ontario Tornado Victims and Support (GOTVS) Facebook group were gathered and analysed using computer-assisted content analysis. The results demonstrate that Facebook was a highly influential source of information and support, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Although misinformation and gossip occurred, the tendency was for the group to self-moderate inaccurate information. Public engagement by local officials may further reduce misinformation and encourage public confidence. The results also show that GOTVS activity significantly declined after two weeks. This abrupt decrease in public attention suggests that the window for engagement by public officials is narrow. As such, officials should have a social media plan in place so that they may engage with the public during the critical response phase when their participation may yield the greatest benefit. Finally, this research underscores the potential for analysing Facebook content using computer-assisted content analysis, a method that may be of interest across the social sciences.

Journal Article,Workplace accommodations for persons with physical disabilities: Evidence synthesis of the peer-reviewed literature.,"Purpose: To identify and synthesize research evidence on workplace accommodations used by employers to recruit, hire, retain, and promote persons with physical disabilities. Method: A structured search of six electronic journal databases was undertaken to identify peer-reviewed literature on the topic published from January 1990 to March 2016. Articles describing or evaluating workplace disability accommodation policies and practices were given a full-text review. Topic experts were contacted to identify additional studies. Results: Details on specific accommodations described in 117 articles were synthesized and organized into three groups comprised of a total of 12 categories. The majority of studies did not rigorously evaluate effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of the accommodations under study. Conclusions: This evidence synthesis provides an overview of the peer-reviewed literature of value to occupational rehabilitation professionals and employers seeking guidance on workplace accommodation policies and practices for persons with physical disabilities. A wide range of accommodation options is available for addressing physical, social, and attitudinal barriers to successful employment. Besides physical/ technological modifications, accommodations to enhance workplace flexibility and worker autonomy and strategies to promote workplace inclusion and integration are important. More comprehensive reporting and evaluations of the effectiveness of accommodations in research literature are needed to develop best practices for accommodating persons with disabilities.

Journal Article,"Sensitivity, reliability and the effects of diurnal variation on a test battery of field usable upper limb fatigue measures.","Fatigue has been linked to deficits in production quality and productivity and, if of long duration, work-related musculoskeletal disorders. It may thus be a useful risk indicator and design and evaluation tool. However, there is limited information on the test–retest reliability, the sensitivity and the effects of diurnal fluctuation on field usable fatigue measures. This study reports on an evaluation of 11 measurement tools and their 14 parameters. Eight measures were found to have test–retest ICC values greater than 0.8. Four measures were particularly responsive during an intermittent fatiguing condition. However, two responsive measures demonstrated rhythmic behaviour, with significant time effects from 08:00 to mid-afternoon and early evening. Action tremor, muscle mechanomyography and perceived fatigue were found to be most reliable and most responsive; but additional analytical considerations might be required when interpreting daylong responses of MMG and action tremor.

Journal Article,Understanding the association between time spent caregiving and well-being among employed adults: Testing a model of work–life fit and sense of community.,"This study examines factors associated with work–life fit and sense of geographic community as mediators of the negative association between caregiving demands and well-being among employed informal caregivers. Data were drawn from a larger project assessing well-being among residents of three mid-size cities in Ontario, Canada. A subsample was selected of informal caregivers who worked for pay for at least eight hours/week (n = 276). Caregiving demands were measured by time spent caring for an adult who was a relative, friend, or neighbour. Well-being followed a holistic conceptualization advanced by the Canadian Index of Wellbeing. The more time spent caregiving, the lower participants’ well-being ratings were. This association was mediated by perceived time adequacy, income adequacy, and sense of community, such that the more time participants spent caregiving, the lower their ratings of these three resources. This explained the initial association of caregiving hours with reduced well-being. Enhanced well-being was more strongly associated with sense of community than any other factor, which supports the importance of the community domain in understanding well-being among employed caregivers and suggests its further testing with other population groups. Policy implications for employers and community organizations are provided.

Journal Article,A spiking neuron model of word associations for the Remote Associates Test.,"Generating associations is important for cognitive tasks including language acquisition and creative problem solving. It remains an open question how the brain represents and processes associations. The Remote Associates Test (RAT) is a task, originally used in creativity research, that is heavily dependent on generating associations in a search for the solutions to individual RAT problems. In this work we present a model that solves the test. Compared to earlier modeling work on the RAT, our hybrid (i.e., non-developmental) model is implemented in a spiking neural network by means of the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF), demonstrating that it is possible for spiking neurons to be organized to store the employed representations and to manipulate them. In particular, the model shows that distributed representations can support sophisticated linguistic processing. The model was validated on human behavioral data including the typical length of response sequences and similarity relationships in produced responses. These data suggest two cognitive processes that are involved in solving the RAT: one process generates potential responses and a second process filters the responses.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 parents (14 mothers and 5 fathers) of primary school aged children. Qualitative analysis revealed that the parents were concerned about healthy living but not necessarily about obesity per se, since some parents resisted the dominant discourse surrounding the notion of obesity risk. It was important for all of the parents, though, to see themselves as ‘good parents’ by ensuring healthy nutrition and exercise. This, in turn, led to considerable challenges for the parents, including workload increase, stress, and frustration. The findings are discussed in terms of new ideologies of intensive parenting and the potential influence of the ‘risk society’ on parenting practices.

Journal Article,Losses disguised as wins in multiline slots: Using an educational animation to reduce erroneous win overestimates.,"Slot machines are available in several countries, with multiline games growing in popularity. Interestingly, many audiovisually reinforced small ‘wins’ in multiline games are in fact monetary losses – outcomes referred to as losses disguised as wins (LDWs). Research suggests that LDWs cause players to overestimate how many times they remember actually winning during a playing session. The study sought to replicate this finding and see if a short educational animation about LDWs could significantly reduce this LDW-triggered win overestimation effect. It employed a mixed design, with animation viewed (LDW, control) as the between-subjects factor, and game played (200 spins on a few LDW or many LDW game; game order counterbalanced) as the within-subjects factor. Fifty-four novice participants estimated how many times they won more than they wagered in each game. In the control animation group, the study replicated the LDW-triggered win overestimation effect for participants playing the many LDW game. Crucially, win overestimates were significantly reduced in this many LDW game for players exposed to the LDW animation. The study concludes that LDWs can lead novice gamblers to remember winning more often than they actually do during a playing session, but educating participants about LDWs can reduce these erroneous win overestimates.

Bayoumi (Harm Reduction Journal, 2017[May][12], Vol 14[16]). In the original article, an error occurred at the beginning of the Methods section. The correction is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-21655-001). Background: The health of people who use drugs (PWUD) is characterized by multimorbidity and chronicity of health conditions, necessitating an understanding of their health care utilization. The objective of this study was to evaluate emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions among a cohort of PWUD. Methods: We used a retrospective observational design between 2012 and 2013. The population was a marginalized cohort of PWUD (the PROUD study) for whom survey data was linked (n = 663) to provincial health administrative data housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. We constructed a 5:1 comparison group matched by age, sex, income quintile, and region. The main outcomes were defined as having two or more ED visits, or one or more hospital admissions, in the year prior to survey completion. We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with these outcomes. Results: Compared to the matched cohort, PWUD had higher rates of ED visits (rate ratio [RR] 7.0; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 6.5–7.6) and hospitalization (RR 7.7; 95% CI 5.9–10.0). After adjustment, factors predicting more ED visits were receiving disability (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.0; 95% CI 1.7–5.5) or income assistance (AOR 2.7; 95% CI 1.5–5.0), injection drug use (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.3–3.4), incarceration within 12 months (AOR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1–2.4), mental health comorbidity (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.4–3.1), and a suicide attempt within 12 months (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.1–3.4). Receiving methadone (AOR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3–0.9) and having a regular family physician (AOR 0.5; 95% CI 0.2–0.9) were associated with lower odds of having more ED visits. Factors associated with more hospital admissions included Aboriginal identity (AOR 2.4; 95% CI 1.4–4.1), receiving disability (AOR 2.4; 95% CI 1.1–5.4), non-injection drug use (opioids and non-opioids) (AOR 2.2; 95% CI 1.1–4.4), comorbid HIV (AOR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2–5.6), mental health comorbidity (AOR 2.4; 95% CI 1.3–4.2), and unstable housing (AOR 1.9; 95% CI 1.0–3.4); there were no protective factors for hospitalization. Conclusions: Improved post-incarceration support, housing services, and access to integrated primary care services including opioid replacement therapy may be effective interventions to decrease acute care use among PWUD, including targeted approaches for people receiving social assistance or with mental health concerns.

Journal Article,Dunning–Kruger effects in reasoning: Theoretical implications of the failure to recognize incompetence.,"The Dunning–Kruger effect refers to the observation that the incompetent are often ill-suited to recognize their incompetence. Here we investigated potential Dunning–Kruger effects in high-level reasoning and, in particular, focused on the relative effectiveness of metacognitive monitoring among particularly biased reasoners. Participants who made the greatest numbers of errors on the cognitive reflection test (CRT) overestimated their performance on this test by a factor of more than 3. Overestimation decreased as CRT performance increased, and those who scored particularly high underestimated their performance. Evidence for this type of systematic miscalibration was also found on a self-report measure of analytic-thinking disposition. Namely, genuinely nonanalytic participants (on the basis of CRT performance) overreported their “need for cognition” (NC), indicating that they were dispositionally analytic when their objective performance indicated otherwise. Furthermore, estimated CRT performance was just as strong a predictor of NC as was actual CRT performance. Our results provide evidence for Dunning–Kruger effects both in estimated performance on the CRT and in self-reported analytic-thinking disposition. These findings indicate that part of the reason why people are biased is that they are either unaware of or indifferent to their own bias.

Journal Article,Association of dual-task gait with incident dementia in mild cognitive impairment: Results from the Gait and Brain Study.,"Importance: Gait performance is affected by neurodegeneration in aging and has the potential to be used as a clinical marker for progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. A dual-task gait test evaluating the cognitive-motor interface may predict dementia progression in older adults with MCI. Objective: To determine whether a dual-task gait test is associated with incident dementia in MCI. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Gait and Brain Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study of community-dwelling older adults that enrolled 112 older adults with MCI. Participants were followed up for 6 years, with biannual visits including neurologic, cognitive, and gait assessments. Data were collected from July 2007 to March 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident all-cause dementia was the main outcome measure, and single- and dual-task gait velocity and dual-task gait costs were the independent variables. A neuropsychological test battery was used to assess cognition. Gait velocity was recorded under single-task and 3 separate dual-task conditions using an electronic walkway. Dual-task gait cost was defined as the percentage change between single- and dual-task gait velocities: ([single-task gait velocity – dual-task gait velocity]/ single-task gait velocity) × 100. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the association between risk of progression to dementia and the independent variables, adjusted for age, sex, education, comorbidities, and cognition. Results: Among 112 study participants with MCI, mean (SD) age was 76.6 (6.9) years, 55 were women (49.1%), and 27 progressed to dementia (24.1%), with an incidence rate of 121 per 1000 person-years. Slow single-task gait velocity (P = .05) while high dual-task gait cost while counting backward (HR, 3.79; 95%CI, 1.57-9.15; P = .003) and naming animals (HR, 2.41; 95%CI, 1.04-5.59; P = .04) were associated with dementia progression (incidence rate, 155 per 1000 person-years). The models remained robust after adjusting by baseline cognition except for dual-task gait cost when dichotomized. Conclusions and Relevance: Dual-task gait is associated with progression to dementia in patients with MCI. Dual-task gait testing is easy to administer and may be used by clinicians to decide further biomarker testing, preventive strategies, and follow-up planning in patients with MCI.

Comment/Reply,Understanding how identity and value motivate self-regulation is necessary but not sufficient: A motivated effort-allocation perspective.,"Comments on an article by Elliot T. Berkman et al. (see record 2017-36101-001). The identity-value model of self-regulation that Berkman, Livingston, and Kahn develop is built upon the motivations that arise from core aspects of people’s self-identities and the subjective value these identities provide to the act of regulation, and is much in the spirit of these new perspectives. This model’s focus on the central role of motivational processes in self-regulation reinforces other similar recent proposals and it possesses a number of important features required to explain the emerging evidence on failures of self-regulation. However, at present, the identity-value model also possesses some important limitations and still requires a substantial amount of further development before it can provide a unique or compelling addition to existing theories on self-regulation and self-control. That is, although this model includes some necessary components for any comprehensive account of self-regulation, it is not sufficient for explaining many of the important processes that influence such regulation.

Journal Article,The Fantasy Engagement Scale: A flexible measure of positive and negative fantasy engagement.,"Despite the prevalence of fantasy activities in day-to-day life, there has been little systematic psychological research on fantasy. Existing work is scattered across numerous fantasy-related topics and are rarely viewed as a collective body of work. We propose a scale of fantasy engagement that addresses this scattered and often-contradictory literature by assessing both positive and negative aspects of fantasy engagement. Across four studies we develop and validate the Fantasy Engagement Scale, establishing its reliability, validity, and applicability to topics including well-being, escapism, and mental imagery. The results begin to reconcile contradictions in the existing research and have implications for future work on fantasy specifically and for studies of fantasy-related activities.

Journal Article,Survey of kinesiologists’ functional capacity evaluation practice in Canada.,"Background: In Canada, functional capacity evaluations (FCEs) are commonly administered by several health care professions including kinesiologists. Kinesiologists have been recently regulated as health care professionals in Ontario and we know little about their demographics, the frequency of FCE administration, or the types of FCEs used by this group. Objective: The purposes of this study were to identify: 1) the demographic characteristics and FCE education of kinesiology FCE practitioners; 2) the FCE systems most used by these practitioners and 3) the constructs from assessments used to determine functional capacity. Methods: A survey was distributed to members of the Canadian Kinesiology Alliance. Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions were calculated from the survey responses (n = 77). Results: FCE practitioners were represented by kinesiologists (79%) practicing more than 15 years and 1–5 years, who received FCE training from a certification course. ARCON (23%) was the most common FCE system used. Lowlevel lifting (43%), mid-lift (38%), pulling (38%) and walking (38%) are the most common FCE task components used to assess functional capacity. Although kinesiologists consider multiple factors when making decisions about task component endpoints, biomechanical observations/body mechanics are the primary methods used. Conclusions: Kinesiologists are conducting FCEs for the primary purpose of preparing return-to-work or workplace accommodation recommendations. Although functional capacity is determined using multiple factors, there is an emphasis on biomechanics and body mechanics. Focusing FCE training and research on these constructs may provide opportunities to further strengthen the reliability and validity of FCE outcomes.

The 2013 Movember campaigns in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom shared the same goal of creating conversations about men’s health that lead to increased awareness and understanding of the health risks men face. Our objective was to explore Twitter conversations to identify whether the 2013 Movember campaigns sparked global conversations about prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and other men’s health issues. We conducted a content analysis of 12,666 tweets posted during the 2013 Movember campaigns in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom (4,222 tweets from each country) to investigate whether tweets were health-related or non-health-related and to determine what topics dominated conversations. Few tweets (n = 84, 0.7% of 12,666 tweets) provided content-rich or actionable health information that would lead to awareness and understanding of men’s health risks. While moustache growing and grooming was the most popular topic in U.S. tweets, conversations about community engagement were most common in Canadian and U.K. tweets. Significantly more tweets co-opted the Movember campaign to market products or contests in the United States than Canada and the United Kingdom (p Twitter suggest that the 2013 Movember campaigns in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom sparked few conversations about prostate and testicular cancers that could potentially lead to greater awareness and understanding of important men’s health issues.

Journal Article,Psychometric properties of the self-perception profile for children in children with chronic illness.,"Objective: The Self-Perception Profile for Children (SPPC) is a commonly used measure of self-concept in children, but little research has examined its psychometric properties in children newly-diagnosed with chronic illness. Method: Confirmatory factor analysis and examination of reliability and convergent and discriminant validity of the SPPC was conducted in 31 children newly-diagnosed with asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, food allergy, or juvenile arthritis. Results: The unidimensionality of each domain of the SPPC was confirmed, internal reliability was robust (α=.83-.95), and inter-domain polychoric correlations ranged from weak to strong (ρ=.05-.85) Convergent validity was demonstrated with measures of global self-concept and domains of quality of life. The Global Self-worth domain showed discriminant validity between children with and without comorbid mental disorder. Conclusions: Findings extend the psychometric properties of the SPPC as a valid and reliable scale in children newly-diagnosed with chronic illness.

Journal Article,Effects of task demands on the early neural processing of fearful and happy facial expressions.,"Task demands shape how we process environmental stimuli but their impact on the early neural processing of facial expressions remains unclear. In a within-subject design, ERPs were recorded to the same fearful, happy and neutral facial expressions presented during a gender discrimination, an explicit emotion discrimination and an oddball detection tasks, the most studied tasks in the field. Using an eye tracker, fixation on the face nose was enforced using a gaze-contingent presentation. Task demands modulated amplitudes from 200 to 350ms at occipito-temporal sites spanning the EPN component. Amplitudes were more negative for fearful than neutral expressions starting on N170 from 150 to 350ms, with a temporo-occipital distribution, whereas no clear effect of happy expressions was seen. Task and emotion effects never interacted in any time window or for the ERP components analyzed (P1, N170, EPN). Thus, whether emotion is explicitly discriminated or irrelevant for the task at hand, neural correlates of fearful and happy facial expressions seem immune to these task demands during the first 350ms of visual processing.

Journal,Consistent belief in a good true self in misanthropes and three interdependent cultures.,"People sometimes explain behavior by appealing to an essentialist concept of the self, often referred to as the true self. Existing studies suggest that people tend to believe that the true self is morally virtuous; that is deep inside, every person is motivated to behave in morally good ways. Is this belief particular to individuals with optimistic beliefs or people from Western cultures, or does it reflect a widely held cognitive bias in how people understand the self? To address this question, we tested the good true self theory against two potential boundary conditions that are known to elicit different beliefs about the self as a whole. Study 1 tested whether individual differences in misanthropy—the tendency to view humans negatively—predict beliefs about the good true self in an American sample. The results indicate a consistent belief in a good true self, even among individuals who have an explicitly pessimistic view of others. Study 2 compared true self‐attributions across cultural groups, by comparing samples from an independent country (USA) and a diverse set of interdependent countries (Russia, Singapore, and Colombia). Results indicated that the direction and magnitude of the effect are comparable across all groups we tested. The belief in a good true self appears robust across groups varying in cultural orientation or misanthropy, suggesting a consistent psychological tendency to view the true self as morally good.

Book,Motivated cognition in relationships: The pursuit of belonging.,"How can newlyweds believe they will be together forever, while knowing that the majority of marriages end in divorce? Why do people who desperately want to be loved end up alienating those who love them? How can partners that seem like complete opposites end up blissfully happy? This volume explores such fascinating questions. Murray and Holmes outline how basic motivations to be safe from being hurt and find value and meaning control how people feel, think, and behave in close relationships. Additionally, the authors highlight how these motivations infuse romantic life through succinct and accessible descriptions of cutting-edge empirical research and vivid evolving stories of four couples confronting different challenges in their relationship. Integrating ideas from the interdependence, goals, and embodiment literatures, this book puts a provocative new spin on seminal findings from two decades of collaborative research. The book: provides a new, interdependence-based, perspective on motivated cognition in close relationships; advances a dyadic perspective that explores how motivation shapes perception and cognition in ways that result In motivation-consistent behavior; examines how'goal-driven'cognition translates a person's wishes, desires, and preferences into judgment and behavior, and ultimately, his or her romantic partner's relationship reality; offers a refreshing argument that the ultimate effects of motivated cognition on satisfaction and stability depend on whether the motivations which most frequently guide perception and cognition match the reality constraints imposed by the perceiver, the partner, and the characteristics of the relationship. This book is essential for social and personality psychologists and will also be valuable to clinical psychologists and clinicians who work directly with couples to effect more happy and stable relationships. Advanced undergraduate and graduate students will find It a highly engaging compendium for understanding how motivation shapes affect, cognition, and behavior in close relationships.

Journal Article,Inference for the autocovariance of a functional time series under conditional heteroscedasticity.,"Most methods for analyzing functional time series rely on the estimation of lagged autocovariance operators or surfaces. As in univariate time series analysis, testing whether or not such operators are zero is an important diagnostic step that is well understood when the data, or model residuals, form a strong white noise. When functional data are constructed from dense records of, for example, asset prices or returns, a weak white noise model allowing for conditional heteroscedasticity is often more realistic. Applying inferential procedures for the autocovariance based on a strong white noise to such data often leads to the erroneous conclusion that the data exhibit significant autocorrelation. We develop methods for performing inference for the lagged autocovariance operators of stationary functional time series that are valid under general conditional heteroscedasticity conditions. These include a portmanteau test to assess the cumulative significance of empirical autocovariance operators up to a user selected maximum lag, as well as methods for obtaining confidence bands for a functional version of the autocorrelation that are useful in model selection/validation. We analyze the efficacy of these methods through a simulation study, and apply them to functional time series derived from asset price data of several representative assets. In this application, we found that strong white noise tests often suggest that such series exhibit significant autocorrelation, whereas our tests, which account for functional conditional heteroscedasticity, show that these data are in fact uncorrelated in a function space.

Journal Article,The effects of social anxiety and online privacy concern on individual differences in internet-based interaction anxiety and communication preferences.,"Social anxiety (SA) and online privacy concerns (OPCs) are conceptually distinct fears, but both may be activated by Internet-based social contexts. Whereas SA is focused on being the object of interpersonal evaluation, OPC is focused on preventing others from gaining unauthorized access to private personal information. No research to date has investigated how SA and OPCs may uniquely or interactively predict individual differences in online interaction anxiety or attitudes and preferences about online communication. Participants (N = 374) completed the Social Phobia Inventory and measures of OPCs, online interaction anxiety, and attitudes related to online communication. The results revealed that SA and OPCs were not correlated with one another; however, they each uniquely predicted significant variance in particular outcomes, with no interactive effects. Findings help to illuminate the ways in which online communication preferences may be differentially shaped by people’s levels of SA and OPCs, respectively. Theoretical implications and applications are discussed.

Results from the multiple regression analysis highlight the predictive importance of cause, social, and event theme as predictors of future intentions.

Journal Article,Implementing Montessori methods for dementia: A scoping review.,"Purpose of the Study: A scoping review was conducted to develop an understanding of Montessori-based programing (MBP) approaches used in dementia care and to identify optimal ways to implement these programs across various settings. Design and Methods: Six peer-reviewed databases were searched for relevant abstracts by 2 independent reviewers. Included articles and book chapters were those available in English and published by the end of January 2016. Twentythree articles and 2 book chapters met the inclusion criteria. Results: Four approaches to implementing MBP were identified: (a) staff assisted (n = 14); (b) intergenerational (n = 5); (c) resident assisted (n = 4); and (d) volunteer or family assisted (n = 2). There is a high degree of variability with how MBP was delivered and no clearly established “best practices” or standardized protocol emerged across approaches except for resident-assisted MBP. Implications: The findings from this scoping review provide an initial road map on suggestions for implementing MBP across dementia care settings. Irrespective of implementation approach, there are several pragmatic and logistical issues that need to be taken into account for optimal implementation.

Chapter,Giving in and giving up: Accommodation and fatalistic withdrawal as alternatives to primary control restoration.,"In this chapter, we combine insights from Rothbaum et al.'s classic dual-process model, with recent theoretical advances in threat compensation literature. We maintain that secondary control processes represent avoidance-oriented resolutions to motivational conflicts Accommodation and withdrawal aroused by threats that challenge primary control. By contrast, approach-oriented resolutions to such conflicts entail persisting in primary control efforts or finding an alternative domain in which to engage primary control. Although much research from the reactive approach motivation (RAM) model has focused on these approach-oriented efforts to retain primary control, comparatively little research has focused explicitly on avoidance-oriented efforts to employ secondary control. After a brief exposition of these classic and contemporary perspectives on control and threat, we review evidence showcasing two specific secondary control processes: accommodation and withdrawal. We show that these processes are most likely to occur when approach-oriented efforts to retain primary control appear overly difficult or impossible due to situational or dispositional limitations. The central purpose of this chapter is to show that accommodation and withdrawal are effective means of resolving motivational conflict, and therefore provide relief from anxiety. However, these secondary control strategies can sometimes be suboptimal, because the same motivational processes can produce vulnerabilities when they are over-extensive, and can thereby pose additional problems for adaptive functioning and psychological well-being.

Journal Article,Factors associated with adolescent online and land-based gambling in Canada.,"Background: With the development of new gambling technology, and increased internet accessibility, online gambling has rapidly emerged as a new gambling market. Governments in numerous jurisdictions have moved to legalize online gambling, yet little is known about the impact of online gambling availability particularly for adolescents. To date, few studies have identified the characteristics of adolescent online gamblers and even fewer have looked at whether these characteristics differ from land-based adolescent gamblers. This study examined socio-demographic and factors associated with online gambling for adolescents and compared this to land-based gamblers to examine whether the profile of online gamblers are unique. Method: Data for the current study comes from the 2012–2013 Youth Gambling Survey (YGS) (n = 10 035) and consists of students in Grades 9 to 12 from three Canadian provinces: Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. Results: Compared to adolescents who did not have a gambling problem, those who had low to moderate (OR = 2.21, p p p p < .001). Other than gender, problem gambling severity and playing free games, when compared to land-based adolescent gamblers, the profile of online gamblers are not that different. Conclusions: Current prevention efforts for adolescents should focus on gambling across modalities.

Erratum/Correction,'Reflective minds and open hearts: Cognitive style and personality predict religiosity and spiritual thinking in a community sample': Corrigendum.,"Reports an error in 'Reflective minds and open hearts: Cognitive style and personality predict religiosity and spiritual thinking in a community sample' by Matthew Browne, Gordon Pennycook, Belinda Goodwin and Melinda McHenry (European Journal of Social Psychology, 2014[Dec], Vol 44[7], 736-742). In the original article, there was an error in the second sentence of the abstract. The corrected sentence should read, 'In a relatively large (N = 1093), older community sample (M= 55.4 years), analytic cognitive style was associated with a lower probability of affiliating with a religious denomination and a lower probability of possessing strong religious faith.' (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-34558-001). We examined associations between two psychological constructs, analytic cognitive style and the personality facet ‘Openness to Experience’, and several dimensions of religiosity: religious affiliation, strength of faith and spiritual epistemology. In a relatively large (N = 1093), older community sample (M = 55.4 years), analytic cognitive style was associated with a lower probability of affiliating with a religious denomination and a higher probability of possessing strong religious faith. Overall, openness was also associated with a lack of religious affiliation but was positively related to possessing a spiritual epistemology. A path‐analytic model revealed that openness had a positive relationship to both faith and religious denomination that was mediated by spiritual epistemology, but negative direct relationships with religiosity after the meditational effects were taken into account. Taken together, these results extend previous findings on the effect of cognitive style on religiosity and provide a new perspective on the complex relationship between cognitive and personality factors and different dimensions of religiosity.

Journal Article,Are high lags of accommodation in myopic children due to motor deficits?,"Children with a progressing myopia exhibit an abnormal pattern of high accommodative lags coupled with high accommodative convergence (AC/A) and high accommodative adaptation. This is not predicted by the current models of accommodation and vergence. Reduced accommodative plant gain and reduced sensitivity to blur have been suggested as potential causes for this abnormal behavior. These etiologies were tested by altering parameters (sensory, controller and plant gains) in the Simulink model of accommodation. Predictions were then compared to the static and dynamic blur accommodation (BA) measures taken using a Badal optical system on 12 children (6 emmetropes and 6 myopes, 8–13 years) and 6 adults (20–35 years). Other critical parameters such as CA/C, AC/A, and accommodative adaptation were also measured. Usable BA responses were classified as either typical or atypical. Typical accommodation data confirmed the abnormal pattern of myopia along with an unchanged CA/C. Main sequence relationship remained invariant between myopic and nonmyopic children. An overall reduction was noted in the response dynamics such as peak velocity and acceleration with age. Neither a reduced plant gain nor reduced blur sensitivity could predict the abnormal accommodative behavior. A model adjustment reflecting a reduced accommodative sensory gain (ASG) coupled with an increased AC cross-link gain and reduced vergence adaptive gain does predict the empirical findings. Empirical measures also showed a greater frequency of errors in accommodative response generation (atypical responses) in both myopic and control children compared to adults.

Journal Article,Buffering against the detrimental effects of demographic faultlines: The curious case of intragroup conflict in small work groups.,"Group faultline literature suggests that subgroups impede group functioning. We propose that team conflict may buffer the detrimental effects of faultlines on group performance. We draw on social categorization and group process theories suggesting that the negative effects of fault‐lines are due to increased competition and decreased communication across subgroups and can be diminished with cross‐subgroup information exchange and elaboration. We propose that intragroup conflict in small groups will decrease negative effects of demographic faultlines because detecting conflict and engaging in conflict management require cross‐subgroup communication and information elaboration. In Study 1, using student groups we found that relationship, task, and process conflict buffered the negative effect of demographic faultline strength on group performance. In Study 2, we manipulated conflict and group faultlines (ethnic faultlines vs. no faultlines) and found that group conflict buffered the negative effect of faultlines on group performance. Theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed.

Journal Article,Survey of Attitudes toward Aviation Safety Management System (SMS) training: Impact of gender and national culture.,"With a growing volume of traffic, the aviation industry is moving to fully embrace a predictive approach to safety management, which requires the implementation of safety management system (SMS) training on an international scale. An online survey was distributed through an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) State Letter to solicit perceptions of SMS training from a variety of international aviation professionals. The survey collected 1,103 complete responses. The results identified robust differences in how SMS training is perceived by men and women and by professionals from different geographic regions. Female respondents had more negative attitudes toward training than did males. Regarding regional differences, Middle Eastern participants had the most positive attitudes while Europeans reported the most negative attitudes toward SMS training. The data suggest caution is warranted before global distribution of SMS training and illustrate the importance of a learner analysis, as individual differences among learners may impact the effectiveness and adoption of SMSs.

Journal Article,"A scoping review of physical rehabilitation in long-term care: Interventions, outcomes, tools.","Residents in long-term care (LTC) often require physical rehabilitation (PR) to maintain/improve physical function. This scoping review described the breadth of literature regarding PR in LTC to date, synthesizing PR interventions that have been evaluated, outcomes used, and tools for determining service eligibility. A structured search, conducted in six licensed databases and grey literature, identified 381 articles for inclusion. Most interventions were delivered and evaluated at the resident level and typically were multicomponent exercise programs. Performance-based measures, activities of daily living, and mood were the most frequently reported outcomes. A key knowledge gap was PR in relation to goals, such as quality of life. Future studies should reflect medically complex residents who live in LTC, and length of residents’ stay should be differentiated. Intervention studies should also explore realistic delivery methods; moreover, tool development for determining service eligibility is necessary to ensure equality in rehabilitative care across the LTC sector.

Journal Article,"Lifelong learning characteristics, adjustment and extra-role performance in cooperative education.","Many organisations hire students from cooperative education (co-op) programmes. These organisations are interested in students’ performance, particularly in their extra-role performance. Previous studies show that socialisation processes play an important part in establishing adjustment and performance. It may also be the case that students’ approach to learning (their motivations, attitudes and strategies) influences the socialisation process, and consequently adjustment and performance. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of co-op students’ lifelong learning characteristics on two organisational socialisation outcomes (role understanding and social acceptance) and three types of extra-role performance (proactive, adaptive and prosocial). Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey of undergraduates (n = 1698) enrolled in co-op who had just completed a work term in a new role. Regression analyses showed that lifelong learning characteristics influenced both forms of adjustment, and all three forms of performance. Further mediation analyses showed that both forms of adjustment partially mediated the relationships between lifelong learning and all three forms of performance. These results suggest that co-op students’ lifelong learning characteristics play an important role during organisational socialisation and subsequent extra-role performance. Implications for future research and for practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","Drewery, David;Nevison, Colleen;Pretti, T.

Journal Article,Health and wellness of long-haul truck and bus drivers: A systematic literature review and directions for future research.,"Objectives: The purpose was to provide a comprehensive review of the literature related to the health and wellness of truck (long and short-haul) and bus drivers in Canada and the USA. Methods: The following databases were searched: Medline (Pubmed), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO and Scopus, as well as the grey literature using a combination of key words (e.g. truck or bus drivers, accidents, health, wellness, road safety). Only English articles published between 2000 and 2016 were included. The search yielded 33 peer reviewed articles and 9 reports relevant to the health and wellness of CMV drivers. Results: The findings show that long-haul truck drivers have multiple risk factors (i.e., smoking, obesity, hypertension, poor diet, lack of exercise, stress and sleep) that can lead to various medical conditions (i.e., cardiovascular disorders, diabetes) and adverse events (i.e., crashes). Several medical conditions including sleep apnea (and fatigue more generally), obesity and cardiovascular disorders are all associated with increased crash risk. There was little information on bus drivers or short-haul truck drivers, however, the available information would suggest they are also exposed to negative work and driver environments leading to the development of risk factors associated with medical conditions. Conclusions: Further research is needed to characterize the work environment and lifestyle practices (particularly sleep, smoking, diet and exercise) of truck and bus drivers to understand the interactions between various risk factors and health outcomes. Obtaining baseline information, including national prevalence rates of health issues, is vitally important for public health, regulatory organizations, and industry to coordinate prevention efforts.

Journal Article,Modeling the pathophysiology of phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction with a triangular glottal model of the vocal folds.,"Purpose: Our goal was to test prevailing assumptions about the underlying biomechanical and aeroacoustic mechanisms associated with phonotraumatic lesions of the vocal folds using a numerical lumped-element model of voice production. Method: A numerical model with a triangular glottis, posterior glottal opening, and arytenoid posturing is proposed. Normal voice is altered by introducing various prephonatory configurations. Potential compensatory mechanisms (increased subglottal pressure, muscle activation, and supraglottal constriction) are adjusted to restore an acoustic target output through a control loop that mimics a simplified version of auditory feedback. Results: The degree of incomplete glottal closure in both the membranous and posterior portions of the folds consistently leads to a reduction in sound pressure level, fundamental frequency, harmonic richness, and harmonicsto- noise ratio. The compensatory mechanisms lead to significantly increased vocal-fold collision forces, maximum flow-declination rate, and amplitude of unsteady flow, without significantly altering the acoustic output. Conclusion: Modeling provided potentially important insights into the pathophysiology of phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction by demonstrating that compensatory mechanisms can counteract deterioration in the voice acoustic signal due to incomplete glottal closure, but this also leads to high vocal-fold collision forces (reflected in aerodynamic measures), which significantly increases the risk of developing phonotrauma.

Journal Article,Sex and gender-based analysis in pharmacy practice research: A scoping review.,"Background: Recognizing the potential effect of sex and gender on health outcomes, there is a shift toward conducting sex and gender-based analysis (SGBA) within health research. However, little is known about the extent to which SGBA has been incorporated into pharmacy practice research. Objectives: To understand the extent to which SGBA is included in pharmacy practice research. Method: Scoping review of English-language studies identified through MEDLINE, Embase, International Pharmacy Abstracts (IPA), and CINAHL (inception to Jan 2014). Two raters independently screened citations to identify titles and abstracts that included key words related to sex or gender and studies that could be categorized as pharmacy practice research. One author extracted data from included studies related to study design, population, intervention/exposure and outcomes, with results reviewed by another. All authors reviewed eligible articles to categorize them based on a previously-developed typology, and to assess four criteria: 1) the inclusion of sex or gender in research objectives, 2) the depth of sex/gender analysis incorporated into study designs and reporting, 3) the inclusion of sex or gender considerations in interpretation of study results, 4) the intentional and accurate use of sex/gender language. Results: Of 458 unique search results, only six articles met the inclusion criteria. Two of these six publications included sex/gender considerations in a model consistent with sex/gender based analysis as described by Hammarström. Three of the six studies inaccurately applied sex and gender terminology, whereas the two studies that featured sex or gender in their primary research question did use these terms appropriately. Conclusion: Despite increasing attention on the need for considering sex and gender, there was a paucity of pharmacy practice research publications that conducted SGBA. This presents an opportunity to explore sex, gender and intersectionality when pursuing studies that explore the impact of pharmacists interventions on patient outcomes.

Journal Article,Pauses in written composition: On the importance of where writers pause.,"Much previous research has conceptualized pauses during writing as indicators of the engagement of higher-level cognitive processes. In the present study 101 university students composed narrative or argumentative essays, while their key logging was recorded. We investigated the relation between pauses within three time intervals (300–999, 1000–1999, and >2000 ms), at different text boundaries (i.e., between words, sentences, and paragraphs), genre (i.e., narrative vs. argumentative), and transcription fluency (i.e., typing speed). Moreover, we investigated the relation between pauses and various lexical characteristics of essays (e.g., word frequency, sentence length) controlling for transcription fluency and genre. In addition to replicating a number of previously reported pause effects in composition, we also show that pauses are related to various aspects of writing, regardless of transcription fluency and genre. Critically our results show that the majority of pause effects in written composition are modulated by pause location. For example, increased pause rates at word boundaries predicted word frequency, while pause rates at sentence boundaries predicted sentence length, suggesting different levels of processing at these text boundaries. Lastly, we report some inconsistencies when using various definitions of pauses. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying effects of pauses at different text boundaries on writing.

Journal Article,Task intensity influences upper limb and torso kinematics during two common overhead Functional Capacity Evaluation tasks.,"Background: The Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) is a tool used in the return-to-work process to guide treatment and decision making. Individual abilities and maximum capacity can be determined through visual observations of changes in mechanics as intensity increases. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine kinematic differences between sexes and intensity levels of two common FCE tasks to establish normative behaviours. Methods: Upper limb and torso kinematics were collected from 30 participants as they performed the overhead lift and overhead work FCE tasks. Mean, maximum, and minimum values were calculated for clinically relevant joint angles. Mean and maximum segment velocity was also calculated and each variable was tested with a mixed model ANOVA. Results: During the overhead lift task, maximum torso flexion and maximum torso extension increased from the lightest to the heaviest load. Humeral flexion angle at the beginning of the lift and wrist ulnar deviation also increased with load. Torso extension, humeral flexion and axial rotation, and wrist extension all increased with time during the overhead work task. Conclusions: Increasing intensity during the overhead tasks influenced kinematic variables. These observable changes can be used by evaluators to more reliably determine safe maximum capacities for each patient and identify compensatory actions.

Journal Article,Young children protest and correct pretense that contradicts their general knowledge.,"We report evidence that children believe that pretend objects and entities should normally be represented as having their factual properties, and that pretense ought not contradict their general knowledge. Across two experiments, 3- and 4-year-olds (N = 160) spontaneously provided corrections and protested pretense scenarios in which animals produced sounds typical of a different species (for example, a duck toy that was made to say, “oink”). Children rarely protested pretense in which animals made species-typical sounds (Experiment 1) or spoke in English (Experiment 2A). Children even provided protests and corrections when the experimenter signaled that the pretense might include unrealistic elements (Experiment 2B). These findings build on accounts claiming that children use their general knowledge to generate and interpret pretense, and show that they attach normative force to the content of pretend play. More generally, the findings advance knowledge of how children respond to information that is counter-intuitive and inconsistent with their expectations.

Journal Article,Expanding conceptualizations of harm reduction: Results from a qualitative community-based participatory research study with people who inject drugs.,"Background: The perspectives of people who use drugs are critical in understanding why people choose to reduce harm in relation to drug use, what practices are considered or preferred in conceptualizations of harm reduction, and which environmental factors interfere with or support the use of harm reduction strategies. This study explores how people who inject drugs (PWID) think about harm reduction and considers the critical imperative of equity in health and social services delivery for this community. Methods: This community-based participatory research study was conducted in a Canadian urban centre. Using a peer-based recruitment and interviewing strategy, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted by and with PWID. The Vidaview Life Story Board, an innovative tool where interviewers and participant co-construct a visual 'life-scape' using a board, markers, and customized picture magnets, was used to facilitate the interviews. The topics explored included injection drug use and harm reduction histories, facilitators and barriers to using harm reduction strategies, and suggestions for improving services and supports. Results: Twenty-three interviews with PWID (14 men and 9 women) were analysed, with a median age of 50. Results highlighted an expanded conceptualization of harm reduction from the perspectives of PWID, including motivations for adopting harm reduction strategies and a description of harm reduction practices that went beyond conventional health-focused concerns. The most common personal practices that PWID used included working toward moderation, employing various cognitive strategies, and engaging in community activities. The importance of social or peer support and improving self-efficacy was also evident. Further, there was a call for less rigid eligibility criteria and procedures in health and social services, and the need to more adequately address the stigmatization of drug users. Conclusions: These findings demonstrated that PWID incorporate many personal harm reduction practices in their daily lives to improve their well-being, and these practices highlight the importance of agency, self-care, and community building. Health and social services are needed to better support these practices because the many socio-structural barriers this community faces often interfere with harm reduction efforts. Finally, “one size does not fit all” when it comes to harm reduction, and more personalized or de-medicalized conceptualizations are recommended.

Journal Article,"Is binge drinking onset timing related to academic performance, engagement, and aspirations among youth in the COMPASS study?","Background: Some evidence suggests early initiation of alcohol use is associated with academic underachievement; however, substance use onset is an ambiguous concept, resulting in mixed findings across studies. Moreover, the quantity of early use is likely an important determinant. Binge drinking is a common pattern among younger cohorts, and is shown to magnify the risk of related problems. Objectives: The current study explored how students who initiated binge drinking early (grade 10 or earlier) or later in high school (grade 11 or 12) differed in relation to a variety of academic indices. Methods: The sample consisted of 19,764 grade 9 to 12 students with at least 2 years of linked-longitudinal data from Year 1(Y₁: 2012-2013), Year 2(Y₂: 2013-2014), and Year 3(Y₃: 2014-2015) of the COMPASS study. Separate multinomial GEE models tested the likelihood of different responses to outcome measures of academic goals, engagement, preparedness, and performance based on the timing of binge drinking onset. Models adjusted for binge drinking initiation in varying frequencies, gender, grade, race/ethnicity, and smoking. Results: Compared to students with earlier onsets of binge drinking, youth with later onsets were more likely to regularly attend class, complete their homework, value good grades, achieve high English or Math marks, have graduate/professional degree ambitions, and expect to obtain a college/trade school diploma after high school, yet they were less likely to expect to achieve a bachelor's degree. Conclusion: Results highlight the importance of substance use prevention programs targeting early adolescents. Both delaying and preventing binge drinking have the potential to improve scholastic outcomes.

This paper reviews the current literature on the pre- and postarrival mental health of refugee children and adolescents to determine (a) whether children and adolescents are liable to be suffering from serious mental health difficulties relating to prearrival trauma that will hamper their future well-being and integration into Canadian society and (b) how the well-being of young refugees in Canada can best be promoted. We particularly focus on how postmigration factors may impact the mental health of child and adolescent refugees. This review has implications for both policy and practice, with a need to concentrate services on those young people who are most vulnerable.

Journal,"If it is absurd, then why do you do it? The richer the obsessional experience, the more compelling the compulsion.","Mounting evidence suggests that obsessive intrusions are often accompanied and amplified by perceptual experiences of different modalities (e.g., feeling dirt on one's skin while experiencing intrusive thoughts about contamination). Pilot studies conducted online with individuals endorsing mild obsessive–compulsive symptoms have linked the co‐occurrence of perceptual experiences and obsessions to the severity of subsequent compulsive behaviour as well as low insight. However, it is presently unclear whether sensory experiences accompany all types of obsessional thoughts or are restricted to certain preoccupations (e.g., contamination and aggression). The present study examined a clinical inpatient and outpatient sample with a formally diagnosed obsessive–compulsive disorder (N = 34). Perceptual properties of intrusive thoughts were assessed with the Sensory Properties of Obsessions Questionnaire. The prevalence of perception‐laden obsessive thoughts was comparable with prior studies (73.5%), but the intensity was significantly greater. No association was observed between perceptual experiences and expert‐rated insight. However, the severity of perception‐laden obsessions predicted the frequency of and impairment associated with compulsive behaviour. This was particularly strong for obsessions about contamination. The present study confirms the high prevalence and clinical relevance of perceptual experiences that accompany obsessions and further challenges the traditional trichotomy splitting mental phenomena into thoughts, intrusions, and hallucinations. Key Practitioner Message Obsessive thoughts are often accompanied by perceptual experiences such as feeling dirt on one's skin or seeing blood before one's inner eye. Sensory experiences have been associated with decreased insight in obsessive–compulsive disorder. We found that 75% of obsessive–compulsive disorder patients have such sensory experiences.

Journal Article,Antipsychotic use and hospitalization among older assisted living residents: Does risk vary by frailty status?,"Objective: To examine associations between baseline frailty measures, antipsychotic use, and hospitalization over 1 year and whether hospitalization risk associated with antipsychotic use varies by frailty level. Methods: In this prospective cohort study of 1,066 residents (mean age: 85 years; 77% women) from the Alberta Continuing Care Epidemiological Studies, trained research nurses conducted comprehensive resident assessments at baseline (2006–2007) for sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, frailty status, behavioral problems, and all medications consumed during the past 3 days. Two separate measures of frailty were assessed, the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) phenotype and an 86-item Frailty Index (FI). Time to first hospitalization during follow-up was determined via linkage with the Alberta Inpatient Discharge Abstract Database. Results: Baseline frailty status (both measures), but not antipsychotic use, was significantly associated with hospitalization over 1 year. When stratified by frailty, FI-defined frail residents using antipsychotics showed a significantly increased risk for hospitalization (adjusted HR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.01–2.36) compared with frail nonusers. CHS-defined frail antipsychotic users versus frail nonusers also showed an elevated risk (adjusted HR: 1.67; 95% CI: 0.96–2.88). Nonfrail residents using antipsychotics were significantly less likely to be hospitalized compared with nonfrail nonusers whether defined by the FI (adjusted HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.39–0.99) or CHS criteria (adjusted HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.40–0.96). Conclusion: Frailty measures may be helpful in identifying those who are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects and those who may experience benefit with treatment.

Journal Article,Increased urge to gamble following near-miss outcomes may drive purchasing behaviour in scratch card gambling.,"Previous research into scratch card gambling has highlighted the effects of these games on players’ arousal and affective states. Specifically, near-miss outcomes in scratch cards (uncovering 2 of 3 needed jackpot symbols) have been associated with high levels of physiological and subjective arousal and negative emotional evaluations, including increased frustration. We sought to extend this research by examining whether near-misses prompted increases in gambling urge, and the subsequent purchasing of additional scratch cards. Participants played two scratch cards with varying outcomes with half of the sample experiencing a near-miss for the jackpot prize, and the other half experiencing a regular loss. Players rated their urge to continue gambling after each game outcome, and following the initial playing phase, were then able to use their winnings to purchase additional cards. Our results indicated that near-misses increased the urge to gamble significantly more than regular losses, and urge to gamble in the near-miss group was significantly correlated with purchasing at least one additional card. Although some players in the loss group purchased another card, there was no correlation between urge to gamble and purchasing in this group. Additionally, participants in the near-miss group who purchased additional cards reported higher levels of urge than those who did not purchase more cards. This was not true for the loss group: participants who experienced solely losing outcomes reported similar levels of urge regardless of whether or not they purchased more scratch cards. Despite near-misses’ objective status as monetary losses, the increased urge that follows near-miss outcomes may translate into further scratch card gambling for a subset of individuals.

Journal Article,Effects of moderate exercise on cortical resilience: A transcranial magnetic stimulation study targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.,"Objective: The beneficial effects of exercise on the brain regions that support cognitive control and memory are well documented. However, examination of the capacity of acute exercise to promote cortical resilience—the ability to recover from temporary pertubation—has been largely unexplored. The present study sought to determine whether single session of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise can accelerate recovery of inhibitory control centers in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex after transient perturbation via continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS). Methods: In a within-participants experimental design, 28 female participants aged 18 to 26 years (mean [standard deviation] = 20.32 [1.79] years) completed a session each of moderate-intensity and very light-intensity exercise, in a randomized order. Before each exercise session, participants received active cTBS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. A Stroop task was used to quantify both the initial perturbation and subsequent recovery effects on inhibitory control. Results: Results revealed a significant exercise condition (moderate-intensity exercise, very light-intensity exercise) by time (prestimulation, poststimulation, postexercise) interaction (F(2,52) = 5.93, p = .005, d = 0.38). Specifically, the proportion of the cTBS-induced decrement in inhibition restored at 40 minutes postexercise was significantly higher after a bout of moderate-intensity exercise (101.26%) compared with very light-intensity exercise (18.36%; t(27) = −2.17, p = .039, d = −.57, 95% confidence interval = −161.40 to −4.40). Conclusion: These findings support the hypothesis that exercise promotes cortical resilience, specifically in relation to the brain regions that support inhibitory control. The resilience-promoting effects of exercise have empirical and theoretical implications for how we conceptualize the neuroprotective effects of exercise.

Journal Article,Orientation probability and spatial exogenous cuing improve perceptual precision and response speed by different mechanisms.,"We are faster and more accurate at detecting frequently occurring objects than infrequent ones, just as we are faster and more accurate at detecting objects that have been spatially cued. Does this behavioral similarity reflect similar processes? To evaluate this question we manipulated orientation probability and exogenous spatial cuing within a single perceptual estimation task. Both increased target probability and spatial cuing led to shorter response initiation times and more precise perceptual reports, but these effects were additive. Further, target probability changed the shape of the distribution of errors while spatial cuing did not. Different routes and independent mechanisms could lead to changes in behavioral measures that look similar to each other and to ‘attentional’ effects.

Journal Article,"Relationship between restraint use, engagement in social activity, and decline in cognitive status among residents newly admitted to long‐term care facilities.","Aim: Declining cognitive function can negatively affect residents’ quality of life (QOL) in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). The present study examined the role of physical restraint use, use of antipsychotic medications, and engagement in social activities to affect change in cognitive status and drive cognitive decline among residents newly admitted to a LTCF. Methods: Secondary data analysis used interRAI Minimum Data Set 2.0 data gathered at admission and first follow-up assessment (n = 111,052). The interRAI Minimum Data Set 2.0 collects comprehensive information as part of regular clinical care, and is mandated for all LTCF in Ontario, Canada. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses investigated the roles of physical restraint use, antipsychotic medication use and social engagement affecting cognition, and were stratified based on the presence/absence of diagnosis of dementia. Results: At follow up, 16.1% of residents (n = 16 414) showed decline in cognition. Residents with one or more physical restraints (chair, trunk and limb) were at increased risk for cognitive decline evidenced among residents with and without a diagnosis of dementia. Antipsychotic medication use did not emerge as a strong predictor of cognitive decline. Social engagement was protective against cognitive decline, and more pronounced for residents without a diagnosis of dementia. Conclusion: Physical restraint use should be avoided, or used as a last resort. LTCFs should prioritize resident engagement in social activities in either formal activities or ad hoc, as soon as possible on entry to the LTCFs. Prioritizing social networks and greater participation in activities might decrease the risk for cognitive decline, thereby improving or maintaining resident quality of life.

Journal Article,Evaluability assessment of a small NGO in water-based development.,"Small non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in water-based development in low- and middle-income countries face unique challenges when it comes to evaluative practice. Few prioritize evaluation because they lack expertise and/or feel strongly about funding programs and not processes, given accountability to donors. To examine facilitators and barriers to evaluation in this context, we embarked on an organizational-level evaluation of H2O 4 ALL, a Canadian NGO with no prior evaluation experience. We first conducted an evaluability assessment, guided by Thurston and Potvin’s framework for social change programs, to understand evaluation priorities and needs. By triangulating findings from three qualitative sources of data—an environmental scan, a document review, and in-depth interviews—we demonstrated evaluability assessments’ applicability to water-based development and established a baseline for further research.

Journal Article,Practice-based qualitative research: Participant experiences of walk-in counselling and traditional counselling.,"Walk-in single session counselling is becoming a more widely used model for delivering mental health services across Ontario. This paper reports findings from the qualitative phase of a mixed method study, exploring the experiences of those attending walk-in counselling model compared to the traditional service delivery model employing a wait list. We used a comparative case study design for the qualitative phase. Findings reveal that participant outcomes of the walk-in counselling model are influenced by accessibility, how a participant makes sense of the service and the degree to which a participant is motivated and able to engage in counselling. Walk-in counselling supports the mental health system by reducing wait lists associated with traditional service delivery models and meeting the needs many people identify for immediate consultation. Other participants still perceive themselves as requiring ongoing counselling over time and involving in-depth exploration. This research supports health systems providing access to both models.

Journal Article,The impact of health-related user interface sounds on player experience.,"Background: Understanding how sound functions on informational and emotional levels within video games is critical to understanding player experience of games. User interface sounds, such as player-character health, are a pivotal component of gameplay across many video game genres, yet have not been studied in detail. Method: To address this research gap in user interface sounds, we present two studies: The first study examines the impact of the presence or absence of player-health sounds on player experience. The second study explores the impact of the types of sound used to indicate player health. We use mixed methods with qualitative and physiological measures. Results: Our results reveal that despite the presence of visual cues, sound is still important to game design for conveying health-related information and that the type of sound affects player experience.

Journal Article,Police encounters among a community sample of children and youth accessing mental health services.,"Generally, within the Canadian context, scholarship on police encounters with persons living with mental illness has focused on the experiences of adults and not children and youth. In this article, we present preliminary work of a secondary data analysis of intake statistics collected over a 5-year period (2009–2014) and a thematic content analysis of qualitative intake notes collected over a 2-year period (2009–2011) about police involvement among a community sample of children and youth accessing mental health services. Of 8,920 intakes completed, 1,449 children and youth, birth to 24 years old, had had police involvement at the time of accessing mental health services. Over the 5 years, the average number of young people with police involvement at the time of accessing mental health services was 16%, or one in six children and youth. Analysis of the qualitative intake notes revealed two main reasons for police involvement: (1) support in the home for a distressed child, and (2) concerns about a child’s conduct and behaviors in the community. The implications for social work practice and future research are discussed.

Journal Article,Chronic corticosterone-induced impaired cognitive flexibility is not due to suppressed adult hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in the etiology of depression. Recent studies suggest new neurons add flexibility to hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. We hypothesized that suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis may contribute to impaired cognitive flexibility associated with depression. The chronic corticosterone (CORT)-induced animal model of depression was used. In Experiment 1, rats received either CORT (40 mg/kg) or vehicle injections for 21 days and were subjected to Water maze during the last six days of drug treatment. No group differences were found during the spatial learning phase; however, cognitive flexibility, measured by reversal training, was significantly impaired in the CORT-treated rats. The probe test revealed enhanced memory of the new platform location for the CORT-treated rats. Given the time newborn neurons require to mature, we presumed if impaired cognitive flexibility seen in Experiment 1 were due to suppressed neurogenesis, terminating CORT treatment 3 days prior to behavioural testing should still induce the impairment. Therefore, Experiment 2 was similar to Experiment 1, except that CORT injections were terminated 3 days prior to behavioural assessment. However, not only was spatial learning significantly enhanced in the CORT-treated rats, but there were also no group differences during reversal or probe tests. Bromodeoxyruidine, administered a day after the first drug treatments in both experiments, was quantified and revealed the number of new neurons were the same in both groups in both experiments. Results suggest cognitive flexibility is impaired in the CORT-induced animal model of depression; an effect that is reversible and independent of suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis.

Journal Article,Not all order memory is equal: Test demands reveal dissociations in memory for sequence information.,"Remembering the order of a sequence of events is a fundamental feature of episodic memory. Indeed, a number of formal models represent temporal context as part of the memory system, and memory for order has been researched extensively. Yet, the nature of the code(s) underlying sequence memory is still relatively unknown. Across 4 experiments that manipulated encoding task, we found evidence for 3 dissociable facets of order memory. Experiment 1 introduced a test requiring a judgment of which of 2 alternatives had immediately followed a word during encoding. This measure revealed better retention of interitem associations following relational encoding (silent reading) than relatively item-specific encoding (judging referent size), a pattern consistent with that observed in previous research using order reconstruction tests. In sharp contrast, Experiment 2 demonstrated the reverse pattern: Memory for the studied order of 2 sequentially presented items was actually better following item-specific encoding than following relational encoding. Experiment 3 reproduced this dissociation in a single experiment using both tests. Experiment 4 extended these findings by further dissociating the roles of relational encoding and item strength in the 2 tests. Taken together, these results indicate that memory for event sequence is influenced by (a) interitem associations, (b) the emphasized directionality of an association, and (c) an item’s strength independent of other items. Memory for order is more complicated than has been portrayed in theories of memory and its nuances should be carefully considered when designing tests and models of temporal and relational memory.

Journal Article,Individual differences in media multitasking and performance on the n-back.,"A number of studies have recently examined the link between individual differences in media multitasking (using the MMI) and performance on working memory paradigms. However, these studies have yielded mixed results. Here we examine the relation between media multitasking and one particular working memory paradigm—the n-back (2- and 3-back)—improving upon previous research by (a) treating media multitasking as a continuous variable and adopting a correlational approach as well as (b) using a large sample of participants. First, we found that higher scores on the MMI were associated with a greater proportion of omitted trials on both the 2-back and 3-back, indicating that heavier media multitaskers were more disengaged during the n-back. In line with such a claim, heavier media multitaskers were also more likely to confess to responding randomly during various portions of the experiment, and to report media multitasking during the experiment itself. Importantly, when controlling for the relation between MMI scores and omissions, higher scores on the MMI were associated with an increase in false alarms, but not with a change in hits. These findings refine the extant literature on media multitasking and working memory performance (specifically, performance on the n-back), and suggest that media multitasking may be related to the propensity to disengage from ongoing tasks.

Journal Article,Prevalence of financial fraud and scams among older adults in the United States: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: The financial exploitation of older adults was recently recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a serious public health problem. Knowledge of the prevalence of elder financial exploitation is mostly limited to the category of financial abuse, which occurs in relationships involving an expectation of trust. Little is known about the other major category of elder financial exploitation—elder financial fraud and scams, which is perpetrated by strangers. A valid estimate of elder financial fraud–scam prevalence is necessary as a foundation for research and prevention efforts. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of elder financial fraud–scam victimization in the United States based on a systematic review and meta-analysis. Search Methods: Multiple investigators independently screened titles and abstracts and reviewed relevant full-text records from PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO, Criminal Justice Abstracts, Social Work Abstracts, and AgeLine databases. Selection Criteria: To maximize the validity and generalizability of prevalence estimation, we restricted eligibility to general populationbased studies (English speaking, 1990 onward) using state- or national-level probability sampling and collecting data directly from older adults. Data Collection and Analysis: Information on elder financial fraud–scam prevalence and study-level characteristics was extracted independently by 2 investigators. Meta-analysis of elder financial fraud–scam prevalence used generalized mixed models with individual studies as levels of a random classification factor. Main Results: We included 12 studies involving a total of 41 711 individuals in the meta-analysis. Overall pooled elder financial fraud–scam prevalence (up to 5-year period) across studies was 5.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.0%, 7.8%), with a 1-year period prevalence of 5.4% (95% CI = 3.2%, 7.6%). Studies using a series of questions describing specific fraud–scam events to measure victimization found a significantly higher prevalence (7.1%; 95% CI = 4.8%, 9.4%) than studies using a single, generalquestion self-report assessment approach (3.6%; 95% CI = 1.8%, 5.4%). Author’s Conclusions: Elder financial fraud and scams is a common problem, affecting approximately 1 of every 18 cognitively intact, community-dwelling older adults each year; it requires further attention from researchers, clinicians, and policymakers. Elder financial fraud–scam prevalence findings in this study likely underestimate the true population prevalence. We provide methodological recommendations to limit older adult participation and reporting bias in future population-based research. Public Health Implications: Elder financial exploitation victimization is associated with mortality, hospitalization, and poor physical and mental health. Health care professionals working with older adults likely routinely encounter patients who are fraud–scam victims. Validation of instruments to screen for elder financial fraud and scams in clinical settings is an important area of future research. Without effective primary prevention strategies, the absolute scope of this problem will escalate with the growing population of older adults.

Journal Article,A maternal diet high in saturated fat impairs offspring hippocampal function in a sex-specific manner.,"While a maternal diet high in saturated fat is likely to affect foetal brain development, whether the effects are the same for male and female offspring is unclear. As a result, we randomly assigned female, Sprague-Dawley rats to either a control, or high-fat diet (HFD; 45% of calories from saturated fat) for 10 weeks. A range of biometrics were collected, and hippocampal function was assessed at both the tissue level (by measuring synaptic plasticity) and at the behavioural level (using the Morris water maze; MWM). Subsequently, a subset of animals was bred and remained on their respective diets throughout gestation and lactation. On post-natal day 21, offspring were weaned and placed onto the control diet; biometrics and spatial learning and memory were then assessed at both adolescence and young adulthood. Although the HFD led to changes in the maternal generation consistent with an obese phenotype, no impairments were noted at the level of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, or MWM performance. Unexpectedly, among the offspring, a sexually dimorphic effect upon MWM performance became apparent. In particular, adolescent male offspring displayed a greater latency to reach the platform during training trials and spent less time in the target quadrant during the probe test; notably, when re-examined during young adulthood, the performance deficit was no longer present. Overall, our work suggests the existence of sexual dimorphism with regard to how a maternal HFD affects hippocampal-dependent function in the offspring brain.

Journal Article,Intrusive thoughts: Linking spontaneous mind wandering and OCD symptomatology.,"One recent line of research in the literature on mind wandering has been concerned with examining rates of mind wandering in special populations, such as those characterized by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dysphoria, and schizophrenia. To best conceptualize mind wandering in studies examining special populations, it has recently been suggested that researchers distinguish between deliberate and spontaneous subtypes of this experience. Extending this line of research on mind wandering in special populations, in a large non-clinical sample (N = 2636), we examined how rates of deliberate and spontaneous mind wandering vary with symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Results indicate that, whereas deliberate mind wandering is not associated with OCD symptomatology, spontaneous mind wandering is, with higher reports of spontaneous mind wandering being associated with higher reports of OCD symptoms. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding both mind wandering and OCD.

Journal Article,A neurobehavioral mechanism linking behaviorally inhibited temperament and later adolescent social anxiety.,"Objective: Behavioral inhibition (BI) is a temperament identified in early childhood that is a risk factor for later social anxiety. However, mechanisms underlying the development of social anxiety remain unclear. To better understand the emergence of social anxiety, longitudinal studies investigating changes at behavioral neural levels are needed. Method: BI was assessed in the laboratory at 2 and 3 years of age (N = 268). Children returned at 12 years, and an electroencephalogram was recorded while children performed a flanker task under 2 conditions: once while believing they were being observed by peers and once while not being observed. This methodology isolated changes in error monitoring (error-related negativity) and behavior (post-error reaction time slowing) as a function of social context. At 12 years, current social anxiety symptoms and lifetime diagnoses of social anxiety were obtained. Results: Childhood BI prospectively predicted social-specific error-related negativity increases and social anxiety symptoms in adolescence; these symptoms directly related to clinical diagnoses. Serial mediation analysis showed that social error-related negativity changes explained relations between BI and social anxiety symptoms (n = 107) and diagnosis (n = 92), but only insofar as social context also led to increased post-error reaction time slowing (a measure of error preoccupation); this model was not significantly related to generalized anxiety. Conclusion: Results extend prior work on socially induced changes in error monitoring and error preoccupation. These measures could index a neurobehavioral mechanism linking BI to adolescent social anxiety symptoms and diagnosis. This mechanism could relate more strongly to social than to generalized anxiety in the peri-adolescent period.

Journal Article,Divergent effects of distance versus velocity disturbances on emotional experiences during goal pursuit.,"Disturbances are factors outside of a person’s control that influence goal progress. Although disturbances are typically included in theoretical accounts of goal pursuit, relatively little empirical research has explicitly considered the effects of disturbances on the goal-striving process. We address this gap in the literature by examining the effects that disturbances have on the emotional experience of goal pursuit. More importantly, we differentiate between distance disturbances (changes to the amount of progress made) and velocity disturbances (changes to the rate of progress made). We conducted 2 experiments (N = 62 and N = 134) in which participants completed work simulation tasks to earn a $5.00 reward. Partway through the experiment participants’ progress was inhibited by either a distance disturbance or a velocity disturbance. Importantly, the distance and velocity disturbances were equated in terms of their influence on the likelihood of obtaining the cash prize. In both studies the introduction of a disturbance decreased enthusiasm and increased frustration. However, over time the effects of distance and velocity disturbances on enthusiasm and frustration diverged. Specifically, the velocity disturbance had a more enduring effect on these emotions, relative to the distance disturbance. Downstream, in Study 1 enthusiasm positively predicted goal commitment. In Study 2 enthusiasm positively predicted goal commitment, effort, and task performance. Likewise, in Study 2 frustration negatively predicted goal commitment and task performance. Therefore, relative to distance disturbances, velocity disturbances appear to be more disruptive to goal pursuit. We discuss theoretical implications and practical implications for managing employee motivation.

Journal Article,Decentering increases approach motivation among distressed individuals.,"Decentering is the process of observing one's thoughts from a self-distanced (i.e. third-person) and non-judgmental perspective, and it is clinically known for its anxiolytic and anti-depressive effects. However there is only preliminary evidence relating decentering to improved motivation, and no studies have controlled for changes in affect which can obscure the measurement of motivation (Harmon-Jones, Harmon-Jones, & Price, 2013). In the current investigation, two experiments tested the hypothesis that decentering increases approach motivation, a buoyant state characterized by goal pursuit, independently of changes in affect. In Study 1 (N = 148), decentering was induced using a self-distancing manipulation (i.e. fly-on-the-wall; Kross & Ayduk, 2011), and in Study 2 (N = 143) decentering was induced using brief instructions on applying non-judgmental awareness of thoughts. Following previous research showing that decentering is most effective against negative emotional reactivity for distressed people (Kross & Ayduk, 2009), our hypothesis focused on high trait distress participants. Trait distress was operationalized as the average of standardized distress-related scales (e.g. rumination, depression, uncertainty aversion), and state affect was operationalized using the Felt Uncertainty Scale and the PANAS. Analyses revealed that decentering increased self-reported approach motivation for high trait distress individuals, and that this effect was not mediated by changes in state affect.

Journal Article,Examining the influence of lecture format on degree of mind wandering.,"We examined mind wandering and memory for information in both live undergraduate lectures and a laboratory-based video lecture. In Study 1, which spanned a full-term live course, we found that degree of mind wandering did not increase over time in an average lecture, and was associated with poorer memory for lecture material. In Study 2, we examined changes in degree of mind wandering across three groups that differed in whether they viewed the lecture in video-recorded or live format, and whether or not they were enrolled in the course. We found that despite viewing the exact same lecture, participants who viewed it in video format showed a significant increase in mind wandering over the duration of the lecture, while those who viewed it live did not. This finding suggests that video, relative to live lectures are especially likely to elicit increases in mind wandering over the duration of a lecture.

Journal Article,Moving beyond assumptions of deviance: The reconceptualization and measurement of workplace gossip.,"Despite decades of research from other academic fields arguing that gossip is an important and potentially functional behavior, organizational research has largely assumed that gossip is malicious talk. This has resulted in the proliferation of gossip items in deviance scales, effectively subsuming workplace gossip research into deviance research. In this paper, the authors argue that organizational research has traditionally considered only a very narrow subset of workplace gossip, focusing almost exclusively on extreme negative cases which are not reflective of typical workplace gossip behavior. Instead of being primarily malicious, typical workplace gossip can be either positive or negative in nature and may serve important functions. It is therefore recommended that workplace gossip be studied on its own, independent of deviance. To facilitate this, the authors reconceptualize the workplace gossip construct and then develop a series of general-purpose English- and Chinese-language workplace gossip scales. Using 8 samples (including qualitative, multisource, multiwave, and multicultural data), the authors demonstrate the construct validity, reliability, cross-cultural measurement invariance, and acceptable psychometric properties of the workplace gossip scales. Relationships are demonstrated between workplace gossip and a variety of other organizational variables and processes, including uncertainty, emotion validation, self-esteem, norm enforcement, networking, influence, organizational justice, performance, deviance, and turnover. Future directions in workplace gossip research are discussed.

Journal Article,The application of a decision-theoretic model to estimate the public health impact of vaporized nicotine product initiation in the United States.,"Introduction: The public health impact of vaporized nicotine products (VNPs) such as e-cigarettes is unknown at this time. VNP uptake may encourage or deflect progression to cigarette smoking in those who would not have otherwise smoked, thereby undermining or accelerating reductions in smoking prevalence seen in recent years. Methods: The public health impact of VNP use is modeled in terms of how it alters smoking patterns among those who would have otherwise smoked cigarettes and among those who would not have otherwise smoked cigarettes in the absence of VNPs. The model incorporates transitions from trial to established VNP use, transitions to exclusive VNP and dual use, and the effects of cessation at later ages. Public health impact on deaths and life years lost is estimated for a recent birth cohort incorporating evidence-informed parameter estimates. Results: Based on current use patterns and conservative assumptions, we project a reduction of 21% in smoking-attributable deaths and of 20% in life years lost as a result of VNP use by the 1997 US birth cohort compared to a scenario without VNPs. In sensitivity analysis, health gains from VNP use are especially sensitive to VNP risks and VNP use rates among those likely to smoke cigarettes. Conclusions: Under most plausible scenarios, VNP use generally has a positive public health impact. However, very high VNP use rates could result in net harms. More accurate projections of VNP impacts will require better longitudinal measures of transitions into and out of VNP, cigarette and dual use. Implications: Previous models of VNP use do not incorporate whether youth and young adults initiating VNP would have been likely to have been a smoker in the absence of VNPs. This study provides a decision-theoretic model of VNP use in a young cohort that incorporates tendencies toward smoking and shows that, under most plausible scenarios, VNP use yields public health gains. The model makes explicit the type of surveillance information needed to better estimate the effect of new products and thereby inform public policy.

In both experiments, children claimed that the outcomes were impossible and could not happen, but nonetheless generated realistic and natural explanations for the outcomes. These findings show that 6- to 7-year-olds are strongly inclined to provide natural explanations. The findings are also informative about children’s judgments about whether outcomes are possible, and further suggest that asymmetries between children’s predictions and explanations may stem from differences in how these 2 forms of reasoning are constrained by possibility.

Journal Article,Relative speed of processing determines color–word contingency learning.,"In three experiments, we tested a relative-speed-of-processing account of color–word contingency learning, a phenomenon in which color identification responses to high-contingency stimuli (words that appear most often in particular colors) are faster than those to low-contingency stimuli. Experiment 1 showed equally large contingency-learning effects whether responding was to the colors or to the words, likely due to slow responding to both dimensions because of the unfamiliar mapping required by the key press responses. For Experiment 2, participants switched to vocal responding, in which reading words is considerably faster than naming colors, and we obtained a contingency-learning effect only for color naming, the slower dimension. In Experiment 3, previewing the color information resulted in a reduced contingency-learning effect for color naming, but it enhanced the contingency-learning effect for word reading. These results are all consistent with contingency learning influencing performance only when the nominally irrelevant feature is faster to process than the relevant feature, and therefore are entirely in accord with a relative-speed-of-processing explanation.

Chapter,Was Buridan a 'psychologist' in his logic?,"If we look back at Gottiob Frege, and all that has stemmed from his work, it may seem easy lo accuse John Buridan of a grossly misconceived psychological approach to logic. For many, if not all, modern logicians, logic involves no reference at all to psychology, for it is the study of formal systems and requires a sharp distinction between formalized syntax, the uninterpreted grammar of the system, and semantics, or whatever relates to interpretation. Even this notion of interpretation can be formalized, so that the well-formed formulas of the system can be regarded not as true or false, but as having some neutrally described value such as 0 or 1. Obviously, such an approach is very far from that adopted by any medieval logician, and the nearest Buridan ever came to contemplating pure formalism is found in his dismissive remarks about certain people who claimed that by the syllogism simpliciter one should understand a syllogism formed from non-significative terms such as A, B, and C. He replied that even the alphabet is ad placitum, and that it is absurd to suppose that any proposition is made of non-significative terms. In order to discover whether Buridan's approach to logic lays him open to Fregean accusations of failing to separate the psychological from the logical, of failing to distinguish taking something to be true from proving it to be true, and of falling into the supposed trap of asking for the meaning of words in isolation rather than in the context of a proposition, I shall start by considering Buridan's account of signification and the role played by concepts in the Buridanian sense of that word. I shall then consider the relationship between spoken language and what may be called mental language, before going on to discuss the truth of propositions and the nature of argumentation.

Journal Article,Global increases in individualism.,"Individualism appears to have increased over the past several decades, yet most research documenting this shift has been limited to the study of a handful of highly developed countries. Is the world becoming more individualist as a whole? If so, why? To answer these questions, we examined 51 years of data on individualist practices and values across 78 countries. Our findings suggest that individualism is indeed rising in most of the societies we tested. Despite dramatic shifts toward greater individualism around the world, however, cultural differences remain sizable. Moreover, cultural differences are primarily linked to changes in socioeconomic development, and to a lesser extent to shifts in pathogen prevalence and disaster frequency.

Journal Article,Wisdom and how to cultivate it: Review of emerging evidence for a constructivist model of wise thinking.,"Some folk beliefs characterize wisdom as an essence – a set of immutable characteristics, developing as a consequence of an innate potential and extraordinary life experiences. Emerging empirical scholarship involving experiments, diary, and cross-cultural studies contradicts such folk beliefs. Characteristics of wise thinking, which include intellectual humility, recognition of uncertainty and change, consideration of different perspectives, and integration of these perspectives, is highly variable across situations. Cumulatively, empirical research suggests that variability in wise thinking is systematic, with greater wisdom in ecological and experimentally-induced contexts promoting an ego-decentered (vs. egocentric) viewpoint. Moreover, teaching for wisdom benefits from appreciation of context-dependency of intentions and actions depicted in the narratives of wisdom exemplars’ lives. I conclude by advancing a constructivist model of wisdom, suggesting that cultural-historical, personal-motivational, and situational contexts play a critical role for wisdom, its development, and its application in daily life.

Journal Article,Perceived addiction as a predictor of smoking cessation among occasional smokers.,"Introduction: Common short screening measures of dependence that use number of cigarettes per day may not be appropriate for use in populations of occasional smokers. Aims: In this study, we investigate whether perceived addiction (PA) predicts quit attempts and successful cessation among occasional smokers. Methods: Current occasional smokers (18+) in the Ontario Tobacco Survey (OTS) longitudinal cohort study followed up every six months for up to three years. Respondents rated their self-perceived level of addiction (very vs. somewhat or not very addicted). Generalised Estimating Equation models and proportional hazard models were used to test the predictive ability of PA. Results/Findings: Occasional smokers with very high PA had a higher likelihood of reporting a quit attempt (RR: 2.49; 95% CI: 1.88, 3.30) after adjusting for demographics. Given an incident quit attempt, occasional smokers who reported being very addicted were 2.93 times more likely to relapse (95%: 2.01, 4.28). The effect of PA was independent of other predictors of smoking behaviour. Conclusions: For some, occasional smokers, smoking cessation is a difficult process that may require significant support. Asking occasional smokers about PA is an effective way to predict likely success in quitting smokers that may be easily assessed in population based, as well as in community and clinical, settings.

Journal Article,Ratings of Everyday Executive Functioning (REEF): A parent-report measure of preschoolers’ executive functioning skills.,"Executive functioning (EF) facilitates the development of academic, cognitive, and social-emotional skills and deficits in EF are implicated in a broad range of child psychopathologies. Although EF has clear implications for early development, the few questionnaires that assess EF in preschoolers tend to ask parents for global judgments of executive dysfunction and thus do not cover the full range of EF within the preschool age group. Here we present a new measure of preschoolers’ EF—the Ratings of Everyday Executive Functioning (REEF)—that capitalizes on parents’ observations of their preschoolers’ (i.e., 3- to 5-year-olds) behavior in specific, everyday contexts. Over 4 studies, items comprising the REEF were refined and the measure’s reliability and validity were evaluated. Factor analysis of the REEF yielded 1 factor, with items showing strong internal reliability. More important, children’s scores on the REEF related to both laboratory measures of EF and another parent-report EF questionnaire. Moreover, reflecting divergent validity, the REEF was more strongly related to measures of EF as opposed to measures of affective styles. The REEF also captured differences in children’s executive skills across the preschool years, and norms at 6-month intervals are reported. In summary, the REEF is a new parent-report measure that provides researchers with an efficient, valid, and reliable means of assessing preschoolers’ executive functioning.

Journal Article,"The role of negative affect and message credibility in perceived effectiveness of smokeless tobacco health warning labels in Navi Mumbai, India and Dhaka, Bangladesh: A moderated-mediation analysis.","Objective: There is strong evidence showing that pictorial health warnings are more effective than text-only warnings. However, much of this evidence comes from high-income countries and is limited to cigarette packaging. Moreover, few studies have identified mechanisms that might explain the impact of warnings. Methods: The current study examined the potential mediating role of negative affect and the moderating influence of message credibility in perceived effectiveness of smokeless tobacco warnings in two low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Field interviews were conducted in India and Bangladesh, with adult (19+ years) smokeless tobacco users (n = 1053), and youth (16–18 years) users (n = 304) and non-users (n = 687). Respondents were randomly assigned to view warnings in one of four conditions: (1) Text-only, (2) pictorial with symbolic imagery, (3) pictorial with graphic images of health effects, or (4) pictorial with personalized graphic images plus a personal testimonial. Results: The findings provide support for the mediating influence of negative affect in perceived effectiveness, for adult and youth smokeless tobacco users who viewed pictorial warnings (vs. text-only), and graphic health warnings (vs. personal testimonials). Among adults, message credibility moderated the indirect effect; the association was stronger when credibility was high and weaker when it was low. Among youth users and non-users, message credibility did not moderate the indirect effect. Conclusions: Consistent with research from high-income countries, these findings highlight the importance of selecting imagery that will elicit negative emotional reactions and be perceived as credible. Differential effects among adults and youth highlight the importance of pre-testing images.

Past research suggests that people with high self-esteem are more expressive and self-disclosing because they trust that others care for them and will not reject them (Gaucher et al., 2012). However, feeling good about oneself may not always be enough; disclosure may also depend on how we feel about other people. Drawing on the principles of risk regulation theory (Murray et al., 2006), we propose that agreeableness—a trait that refers to the positivity of interpersonal motivations and behaviors—is a key determinant of trust in a partner’s caring and responsiveness, and may work in conjunction with self-esteem to predict disclosure. We examined this possibility by exploring how both self-esteem and agreeableness predict a particularly risky and intimate form of self-disclosure, the disclosure of emotional distress. In 6 studies using correlational, partner-report, and experimental methods, we demonstrate that self-esteem and agreeableness interact to predict disclosure: People who are high in both self-esteem and agreeableness show higher emotional disclosure. We also found evidence that trust mediates this effect. People high in self-esteem and agreeableness are most self-revealing, it seems, because they are especially trusting of their partners’ caring. Self-esteem and agreeableness were particularly important for the disclosure of vulnerable emotions (i.e., sadness; Study 5) and disclosures that were especially risky (Study 6). These findings illustrate how dispositional variables can work together to explain behavior in close relationships.

Journal Article,Cognitive aging and the distinction between intentional and unintentional mind wandering.,"A growing number of studies have reported age-related reductions in the frequency of mind wandering. Here, at both the trait (Study 1) and state (Study 2) levels, we reexamined this association while distinguishing between intentional (deliberate) and unintentional (spontaneous) mind wandering. Based on research demonstrating age-accompanied deficits in executive functioning, we expected to observe increases in unintentional mind wandering with increasing age. Moreover, because aging is associated with increased task motivation, we reasoned that older adults might be more engaged in their tasks, and hence, show a more pronounced decline in intentional mind wandering relative to young adults. In both studies, we found that older adults did indeed report lower rates of intentional mind wandering compared with young adults. However, contrary to our expectations, we also found that older adults reported lower rates of unintentional mind wandering (Studies 1 and 2). We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of age-related declines in mind wandering.

Journal Article,Everyday attention.,"Understanding the basic mechanisms underlying attentional function using naturalistic stimuli, tasks, and/or settings is the focus of everyday attention research. Interest in everyday approaches to attention research has increased recently—arguably riding a more general wave of support for such considerations in experimental psychology. This special issue of the Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology attempts to capture the emerging enthusiasm for studying everyday attention by bringing together work from a wide array of attentional domains (e.g., visual attention, dual tasking, search, mind wandering, social attention) that are representative of this general approach. The 14 contributions to the special issue highlight the breadth of topics addressed in this research, the methodological creativity required to carry it out, and the promise of everyday attention for understanding the basic mechanisms underlying attentional function. This introduction will summarise the everyday attention approach as represented in the contributions to the special issue.

Journal Article,Wandering minds and wavering goals: Examining the relation between mind wandering and grit in everyday life and the classroom.,"Here we examined the relation between mind wandering and the personality trait of ‘grit.’ Our hypothesis was that because mind wandering leads to a disruption of momentary goal completion, the tendency to mind wander might be inversely related to the completion of long-term goals that require sustained interest and effort (i.e., grittiness). In Study 1 we used online questionnaires and found that in everyday life, the propensity to mind wander was negatively correlated with individuals’ self-reported grittiness. Interestingly, the relation between mind wandering and grit was strongest for unintentional bouts of mind wandering (as compared with intentional mind wandering). We extended these findings in Study 2 by (a) using a more heterogeneous sample of participants, (b) including a measure of conscientiousness, and (c) including another measure of general perseverance. In addition to replicating our findings from Study 1, in Study 2 we found that the grit measure uniquely predicted spontaneous mind wandering over and above a measure of conscientiousness and an alternative measure of general perseverance. Lastly, in Study 3 we extend the relation between mind wandering and grit to the classroom, finding that mind wandering during university lectures was also related to self-reported grittiness. Taken together, we suggest that the propensity to experience brief lapses of attention is associated with the propensity to stick-with and complete long-term goals. We also provide evidence that when predicting mind wandering and inattention, measures of grit are not redundant with existing measure of conscientiousness and general perseverance.

Journal Article,A framework for evaluating the public health impact of e‐cigarettes and other vaporized nicotine products.,"The use of vaporized nicotine products (VNPs), especially e‐cigarettes and, to a lesser extent, pressurized aerosol nicotine products and heat‐not‐burn tobacco products, are being adopted increasingly as an alternative to smoking combusted products, primarily cigarettes. Considerable controversy has accompanied their marketing and use. We propose a framework that describes and incorporates patterns of VNP and combustible cigarette use in determining the total amount of toxic exposure effects on population health. We begin by considering toxicity and the outcomes relevant to population health. We then present the framework and define different measures of VNP use; namely, trial and long‐term use for exclusive cigarette smokers, exclusive VNP and dual (cigarette and VNP) use. Using a systems thinking framework and decision theory we considered potential pathways for current, former and never users of VNPs. We then consider the evidence to date and the probable impacts of VNP use on public health, the potential effects of different policy approaches and the possible influence of the tobacco industry on VNP and cigarette use.

Journal Article,Disentangling the relationship between gender and work–family conflict: An integration of theoretical perspectives using meta-analytic methods.,"Implicit in many discussions of work–family issues is the idea that managing the work–family interface is more challenging for women than men. We address whether this intuition is supported by the empirical data via a meta-analysis of gender differences in work–family conflict (WFC) based on more than 350 independent samples (N > 250,000 workers). Challenging lay perceptions, our results demonstrate that men and women generally do not differ on their reports of WFC, though there were some modest moderating effects of dual-earner status, parental status, type of WFC (i.e., time-, strain-, vs. behavior-based), and when limiting samples to men and women who held the same job. To better understand the relationship between gender and WFC, we engaged in theory-testing of mediating mechanisms based on commonly invoked theoretical perspectives. We found evidence in support of the rational view, no support for the sensitization and male segmentation perspectives, and partial support for the asymmetrical domain permeability model. Finally, we build theory by seeking to identify omitted mediators that explain the relationship between gender and work-interference-with-family, given evidence that existing theoretically specified mechanisms are insufficient to explain this relationship. Overall, we find more evidence for similarity rather than difference in the degree of WFC experienced by men and women.

Journal Article,Cognitive coupling during reading.,"We hypothesize that cognitively engaged readers dynamically adjust their reading times with respect to text complexity (i.e., reading times should increase for difficult sections and decrease for easier ones) and failure to do so should impair comprehension. This hypothesis is consistent with theories of text comprehension but has surprisingly been untested. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing 4 datasets in which participants (N = 484) read expository texts using a self-paced reading paradigm. Participants self-reported mind wandering in response to pseudorandom thought-probes during reading and completed comprehension assessments after reading. We computed two measures of cognitive coupling by regressing each participant’s paragraph-level reading times on two measures of text complexity: Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level and Word Concreteness scores. The two coupling measures yielded convergent findings: coupling was a negative predictor of mind wandering and a positive predictor of both text- and inference-level comprehension. Goodness-of-fit, measured with Akaike information criterion, also improved after adding coupling to the reading-time only models. Furthermore, cognitive coupling mediated the relationship between mind wandering and comprehension, supporting the hypothesis that mind wandering engenders a decoupling of attention from external stimuli.

Journal Article,On the prospect of knowing: Providing solutions can reduce persistence.,"Our willingness to persist in problem solving is often held up as a critical component in being successful. Allied against this ability, however, are a number of situational factors that undermine our persistence. In the present investigation, the authors examine 1 such factor—knowing that the answers to a problem are easily accessible. Does having answers to a problem available reduce our willingness to persist in solving it ourselves? Across 4 experiments, participants (university students from a large Canadian University) solved multisolution anagrams and were either provided the answers after giving up (and knew they would receive the answers) or not. Results demonstrated that individuals persisted for less time in the former condition. In addition, participants did not seem to be aware of the effect that answers had on their decisions to quit. Implications for our understanding of the role that access to answers has on persistence across a number of domains (e.g., education, Internet) are discussed.

Journal Article,Does the regulatory environment for e-cigarettes influence the effectiveness of E-cigarettes for smoking cessation?: Longitudinal findings from the ITC four country survey.,"Introduction: To date, no studies have explored how different regulatory environments may influence the effectiveness of electronic cigarettes (ECs) as a smoking cessation aid. Objective: This study compares the real-world effectiveness of adult smokers using ECs for quitting compared with quitting unassisted or quitting with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and/or prescription medications in two countries with restrictive policies towards ECs (ie, Canada and Australia) versus two countries with less restrictive policies (ie, United States and United Kingdom). Methods: Data were drawn from the International Tobacco Control Four Country surveys, from the United States and Canada (2 waves, n = 318 and 380, respectively), the United Kingdom (3 waves, n = 439) and Australia (4 waves, n = 662), collected 2010–2014. Smokers at baseline wave who reported making a quit attempt at follow-up were included. The primary outcome was self-reported abstinence for at least 30 days regardless of smoking status at follow-up assessment. Data across waves were combined and analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Results: Compared to unassisted quitting (ie, no medications or ECs), smokers who used ECs for quitting from countries with less restrictive EC policy environments were more likely (OR = 1.95, 95%CI = 1.19–3.20, p p < .01), to report sustained abstinence for at least 30 days. Conclusions: Use of ECs in the real world during a quit attempt appears only effective for sustaining smoking abstinence in a less restrictive EC environment suggesting that the benefits of ECs for smoking cessation are likely highly dependent on the regulatory environment. Implications: What this study adds: This is the first study to examine the impact of regulatory environment for ECs on their real-world effectiveness for smoking cessation. This study shows that in a less restrictive EC regulatory environment, use of ECs during a quit attempt facilitates, but in a more restrictive environment, it inhibits, short-term sustained abstinence. The findings underscore the need for careful consideration on how best to regulate this emerging product so that EC benefits for smoking cessation are maximized and its risks to public health are minimized.
