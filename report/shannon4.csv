These behaviors are typically characterized using either optical, atomic force, confocal, or electron microscopy; however, most microscopic techniques are generally restricted to observing what's happening on the ""top"" side or even the interior of the cell. Our group has focused on engineered surfaces typically reserved for microelectronics as potential surfaces to control cell behavior. These devices allow the exploration of novel substrates including titanium, tungsten, and tantalum intermixed with silicon oxide. Furthermore, these devices allow the exploration of the intricate patterning of surface materials and surface geometries i.e., trenches. Here we present two important advancements in our research: (1) the ability to split a fixed cell through the nucleus using an inexpensive three-point bend micro-cleaving technique and image 3D nanometer scale cellular components using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy; and (2) the observation of nanometer projections from the underbelly of a cell as it sits on top of patterned trenches on our devices. This application of a 3-point cleaving technique to visualize the underbelly of the cell is allowing a new understanding of how cells descend into surface cavities and is providing a new insight on cell migration mechanisms. © 2018 by the authors.",Adhesion; Cross-sectioning; Mammalian cells; Morphology; Nanoscale; Tantalum,Adhesion; Cells; Mammals; Microelectronics; Morphology; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicon compounds; Silicon oxides; Tantalum; Tantalum compounds; Titanium oxides; Cellular components; Cross-sectioning; Engineered surfaces; High-resolution scanning electron microscopies; Mammalian cells; Microscopic techniques; Nano scale; Potential surfaces; Cytology,,MDPI AG,19961944,,,,English,Mater.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059342354,

A serious unbalance of traffic flow in the network can speed up pavement deterioration of highways with heavy traffic, which influences the sustainability of pavement performance and increases maintenance expenditures. The purpose of this research is to obtain a more optimized traffic assignment for pavement damage reduction by establishing a multi-objective DTA model with the objectives of not only minimum travel time but minimum decline of Present Serviceability Index (PSI) for pavements. Then, teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is utilized to solve the proposed model. Results of a case study indicate that a more balanced traffic flow assignment can be realized by the model, which can effectively reduce average PSI loss, save maintenance expenditures, extend pavement service life span, save fuel consumption and reduce pollutant emissions in spite of a little increase of average travel time. Additionally, sensitivity of weight factor for the two objective functions is analyzed. This research provides some insights on methods on sustainable pavement performance. © 2018 by the authors.",DTA model; Fuel consumption; Maintenance expenditures; Pavement service life span; Pollutant emissions; PSI; Sustainability of pavement performance; TLBO; Travel time,algorithm; expenditure; fuel consumption; index method; maintenance; model; pavement; pollution; road; sustainability; traffic management; travel time,,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059351604,

The Fracture Risk Scale (FRS) was designed for fracture risk assessment in LTC, to optimize targeting of services in those at highest risk. This study aims to examine the construct validity and discriminative properties of the FRS in three Canadian provinces at 1-year follow up. Methods: LTC residents were included if they were: 1) Adults admitted to LTC homes in Ontario (ON), British Columbia (BC) and Manitoba (MB) Canada; and 2) Received a Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set Version 2.0. After admission to LTC, one-year hip fracture risk was evaluated for all the included residents using the FRS (an eight-level risk scale, level 8 represents the highest fracture risk). Multiple logistic regressions were used to determine the differences in incident hip or all clinical fractures across the provinces and FRS risk levels. We examined the differences in incident hip or all clinical fracture for each FRS level across the three provinces (adjusted for age, BMI, gender, fallers and previous fractures). We used the C-statistic to assess the discriminative properties of the FRS for each province. Results: Descriptive statistics on the LTC populations in ON (n = 29,848), BC (n = 3129), and MB (n = 2293) are: mean (SD) age 82 (10), 83 (10), and 84 (9), gender (female %) 66, 64, and 70% respectively. The incident hip fractures and all clinical fractures for FRS risk level were similar among the three provinces and ranged from 0.5 to 19.2% and 1 to 19.2% respectively. The overall discriminative properties of the FRS were similar between ON (C-statistic = 0.673), BC (C-statistic = 0.644) and MB (C-statistic = 0.649) samples. Conclusion: FRS is a valid tool for identifying LTC residents at different risk levels for hip or all clinical fractures in three provinces. Having a fracture risk assessment tool that is tailored to the LTC context and embedded within the routine clinical assessment may have significant implications for policy, service delivery and care planning, and may improve care for LTC residents across Canada. © 2018 The Author(s).",Hip fracture; InterRAI prediction; Long term care; Mortality; Nursing home,,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712318,,,30587140,English,BMC Geriatr.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059246347,

Enhancement of longwave radiation beneath coniferous forests has been found to impact the surface energy balance and rates of snowmelt. Although the skill of model-simulated snowmelt has been shown to be lower for forests than for open areas, model intercomparisons and evaluations of model parameterizations have not yet focused on longwave enhancement. This study uses stand-scale forcing for the simulation of subcanopy longwave radiation by Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) and to drive SNOWPACK, a snow model featuring more complex canopy structure, as a benchmark model for CLM4.5. Simulated subcanopy longwave radiation and longwave enhancement are assessed using measurements from forest stands located within perennially snow-covered regions. These forest stands, of varying canopy density, cover the range of boreal plant functional types in CLM4.5. CLM4.5 is found to overestimate the diurnal range of subcanopy longwave radiation and longwave enhancement, and simulation errors increase with decreasing cloudiness and increasing vegetation density. Implementation of a parameterization of heat storage by biomass reduces simulation errors but only marginally affects the amplitude of diurnal ranges. These results reaffirm previous findings that simulation of subcanopy longwave radiation can be improved by partitioning the vegetation canopy into two layers. Moreover, this study reveals the variations of simulation errors across meteorological conditions and vegetation density, the latter of which is the most important parameter for longwave enhancement independent of vegetation type. ©2018.

The proposed control scheme is experimentally validated in the presence of real-world uncertainties in quadrotor system parameters and sensor measurement. The designed control scheme guarantees asymptotic stability of the close-loop system with the help of complete controllability of the attitude dynamics in applying optimal control signals. To achieve robustness against parametric uncertainties, the optimal tracking solution is combined with an online least squares based parameter identification scheme to estimate the instantaneous inertia of the quadrotor. Sensor measurement noises are also taken into account for the on-board Inertia Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. To improve controller performance in the presence of sensor measurement noises, two sensor fusion techniques are employed, one based on Kalman filtering and the other based on complementary filtering. The ALQT controller performance is compared for the use of these two sensor fusion techniques, and it is concluded that the Kalman filter based approach provides less mean-square estimation error, better attitude estimation, and better attitude control performance.",adaptive linear quadratic tracking; indirect estimation; Kalman filter; least squares estimation; quadrotor UAV; sensor fusion,,,NLM (Medline),14248220,,,30583553,English,Sensors (Basel),Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058922118,

PROSPECT, the Precision Reactor Oscillation and Spectrum Experiment, consists of a segmented 4 ton Li6-doped liquid scintillator detector covering a baseline range of 7-9 m from the reactor and operating under less than 1 m water equivalent overburden. Data collected during 33 live days of reactor operation at a nominal power of 85 MW yield a detection of 25 461±283 (stat) inverse beta decays. Observation of reactor antineutrinos can be achieved in PROSPECT at 5? statistical significance within 2 h of on-surface reactor-on data taking. A reactor model independent analysis of the inverse beta decay prompt energy spectrum as a function of baseline constrains significant portions of the previously allowed sterile neutrino oscillation parameter space at 95% confidence level and disfavors the best fit of the reactor antineutrino anomaly at 2.2? confidence level. © 2018 authors.

Little research, however, has examined the effect of patients using eHealth tools to self-report their medication management and use. Similarly, there is little evidence showing how eHealth tools might prompt patients and health care providers to make appropriate changes to medication use. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to determine the impact of patients' use of eHealth tools on self-reporting adverse effects and symptoms that promote changes to medication use. Related secondary outcomes were also evaluated. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched from January 1, 2000, to April 25, 2018. Reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and included articles from the literature search were also screened to identify relevant studies. Title, abstract, and full-text review as well as data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by 2 reviewers. Due to high heterogeneity, results were not meta-analyzed and instead presented as a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies, including 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 1 open-label intervention, were included, from which 11 unique eHealth tools were identified. In addition, 14 RCTs found statistically significant increases in positive medication changes as a result of using eHealth tools, as did the single open-label study. Moreover, 8 RCTs found improvement in patient symptoms following eHealth tool use, especially in adolescent asthma patients. Furthermore, 3 RCTs showed that eHealth tools might improve patient self-efficacy and self-management of chronic disease. Little or no evidence was found to support the effectiveness of eHealth tools at improving medication recommendations and reconciliation by clinicians, medication-use behavior, health service utilization, adverse effects, quality of life, or patient satisfaction. eHealth tools with multifaceted functionalities and those allowing direct patient-provider communication may be more effective at improving patient self-management and self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that the use of eHealth tools may improve patient symptoms and lead to medication changes. Patients generally found eHealth tools useful in improving communication with health care providers. Moreover, health-related outcomes among frequent eHealth tool users improved in comparison with individuals who did not use eHealth tools frequently. Implementation issues such as poor patient engagement and poor clinician workflow integration were identified. More high-quality research is needed to explore how eHealth tools can be used to effectively manage use of medications to improve medication management and patient outcomes. ©Karla Lancaster, Aseel Abuzour, Manmeet Khaira, Annalise Mathers, April Chan, Vivian Bui, Annie Lok, Lehana Thabane, Lisa Dolovich.

The quasi-static response showed symmetric behavior for the samples tested along RD and 45° whereas the ED samples manifested completely asymmetric behavior. Although the ED samples exhibited longer fatigue lives than the RD and 45° in the high cycle fatigue, the fatigue lives in the low cycle fatigue regime were similar. The texture measurement indicated a sharp basal texture along ED, explaining its asymmetric behavior. Higher tensile mean stress and less dissipated plastic energy per cycle for the ED samples, acting as two competing factors, were the principal reasons for exhibiting fatigue responses identical to those of RD and 45° in the LCF regime. The fracture surface in the ED direction was dominated by twin lamellae and profuse twinned grains, whereas that in RD was dominated by slip bands. Finally, Smith-Watson-Topper and Jahed-Varvani models were employed to predict the fatigue lives along all directions using a single set of material parameters. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Anisotropy; Asymmetry; Characterization; Fatigue modeling; Texture; ZK60 extrusion,Anisotropy; Characterization; Extrusion; Tensile strength; Textures; Asymmetric behaviors; Asymmetry; Fatigue model; Material parameter; Quasi static response; Smith-watson-topper; Strain controlled fatigue; Texture measurement; Fatigue of materials,,Elsevier Ltd,2641275,,,,English,Mater.

Within the selected process window, the results obtained from X-ray computed tomography analysis indicate that the relative density of as-built samples increases with an increase in laser power. In addition, it is observed that irregular-shaped pores with the longest axis normal to the building direction are significantly reduced with increasing the laser power. Microstructural investigation suggests that with increasing the laser power, a transformation from conduction to transition and keyhole modes occurs. In X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-built samples, only fcc ?-phase is detected and no reflection of bcc ?-phase is found. Texture measurements show that the intensity of ?110? crystallographic orientation along the building direction of the as-built samples increases with increasing laser power. Coefficient of thermal expansion of the as-built samples is very low and comparable to that of conventionally manufactured Invar alloy. Furthermore, as-built samples fabricated at lowest (250 W) and highest (400 W) laser powers exhibit the lowest and highest thermal expansion displacement, respectively. Finally, the thermal expansion behavior and its correlation with structural integrity and texture are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Invar alloy; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure; Porosity; Thermal expansion,Computerized tomography; Fabrication; Gamma rays; Laser optics; Microstructure; Porosity; Crystallographic orientations; Invar alloy; Laser powders; Microstructural investigation; Relative density; Texture measurement; Thermal expansion behavior; X-ray computed tomography; Thermal expansion,,Elsevier Ltd,2641275,,,,English,Mater.

However, their caring responsibilities often affect their psychological wellbeing and ability to continue in their role. It is of paramount importance to easily identify caregivers that would benefit from immediate assistance. Methods: In this nonexperimental cohort study, a cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 362 informal caregivers (mean age 64.1 years, SD ± 13.1) caring for persons with high care needs (mean age 78.6 years, SD ± 15.0). Caregivers were interviewed using an interRAI-based self-reported survey with 82 items covering characteristics of caregivers including key aspects of wellbeing. A factor analysis identified items in the caregiver survey dealing with subjective wellbeing that were compared against other wellbeing measures. A screener, called Caregiver Wellbeing Index (CWBI), consisting of four items with response scores ranging from 0 to 2 was created. The CWBI was validated in a follow-up study in which 1020 screeners were completed by informal caregivers of home care clients. Clinical assessments of the care recipients (n = 262) and information on long-term care home (LTCH) admission (n = 176) were linked to the screener dataset. The association between the CWBI scores and caregiver and care recipient characteristics were assessed using logistic regression models and chi-square tests. The reliability of CWBI was also measured. Results: The CWBI scores ranging from zero to eight were split in four 'wellbeing' levels (excellent, good, fair, poor). In the validation study, fair/poor psychological wellbeing was strongly associated with caregiver reports of inability to continue in their role; conflict with family; or feelings of distress, anger, or depression (P < 0.0001). Caregivers caring for a care recipient that presented changes in behavior, cognition, and mood were more likely to present fair/poor wellbeing (P < 0.0001). Additionally, caregivers with high CWBI scores (poor wellbeing) were also more likely to provide care for someone who was admitted to a LTCH (OR 3.52, CI 1.32-9.34) after controlling for care recipient and caregiver characteristics. The Cronbach alpha value 0.89 indicated high reliability. Conclusion: The CWBI is a valid screener that can easily identify caregivers that might benefit from further assessment and interventions. © 2018 The Author(s).",Carer; Home care; interRAI; Long-term care home; Screener,,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712318,,,30545318,English,BMC Geriatr.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058535102,

Recently, there has been an increasing effort to deterministically integrate single semiconductor quantum dots into complex photonic circuits. Despite rapid progress in the field, it remains challenging to manipulate the optical properties of waveguide-integrated quantum emitters in a deterministic, reversible, and nonintrusive manner. Here we demonstrate a new class of hybrid quantum photonic circuits combining III-V semiconductors, silicon nitride, and piezoelectric crystals.

This work provides the first quantitative assessment of the role of compensation between uncertainties in aerosol forcing and atmospheric parameters, and their impact on the climate sensitivity of the Community Atmosphere Model, Version 4 (CAM4). Running the model with prescribed ocean and ice conditions, we perturb four parameters related to sulfate and black carbon aerosol radiative forcing and distribution, as well as five atmospheric parameters related to clouds, convection, and radiative flux. In this experimental setup where aerosols do not affect the properties of clouds, the atmospheric parameters explain the majority of variance in climate sensitivity, with two parameters being the most important: one controlling low cloud amount, and one controlling the timescale for deep convection. Although the aerosol parameters strongly affect aerosol optical depth, their impacts on climate sensitivity are substantially weaker than the impacts of the atmospheric parameters, but this result may depend on whether aerosol-cloud interactions are simulated. Based on comparisons to inter-model spread of other ESMs, we conclude that structural uncertainties in this configuration of CAM4 likely contribute 3 times more to uncertainty in climate sensitivity than parametric uncertainties. We provide several parameter sets that could provide plausible (measured by a skill score) configurations of CAM4, but with different sulfate aerosol radiative forcing, black carbon radiative forcing, and climate sensitivity. © Author(s) 2018.",,aerosol; atmospheric modeling; black carbon; parameter estimation; radiative forcing; uncertainty analysis,,Copernicus GmbH,16807316,,,,English,Atmos.

The rationale for embedding sustainability from the beginning of implementation is well recognized; however, strategies to sustain and spread successful initiatives are less clearly described. The aim of this study is to identify strategies used by hospital staff and management to sustain and spread successful nutrition care improvements in Canadian hospitals. Methods: The More-2-Eat project used participatory action research to improve nutrition care practices. Five hospital units in four Canadian provinces had one year to improve the detection, treatment, and monitoring of malnourished patients. Each hospital had a champion and interdisciplinary site implementation team to drive changes. After the year (2016) of implementing new practices, site visits were completed at each hospital to conduct key informant interviews (n = 45), small group discussions (4 groups; n = 10), and focus groups (FG) (11 FG; n = 71) (total n = 126) with staff and management to identify enablers and barriers to implementing and sustaining the initiative. A year after project completion (early 2018) another round of interviews (n = 12) were conducted to further understand sustaining and spreading the initiative to other units or hospitals. Verbatim transcription was completed for interviews. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts, FG notes, and context memos was completed. Results: After implementation, sites described a culture change with respect to nutrition care, where new activities were viewed as the expected norm and best practice. Strategies to sustain changes included: maintaining the new routine; building intrinsic motivation; continuing to collect and report data; and engaging new staff and management. Strategies to spread included: being responsive to opportunities; considering local context and readiness; and making it easy to spread. Strategies that supported both sustaining and spreading included: being and staying visible; and maintaining roles and supporting new champions. Conclusions: The More-2-Eat project led to a culture of nutrition care that encouraged lasting positive impact on patient care. Strategies to spread and sustain these improvements are summarized in the Sustain and Spread Framework, which has potential for use in other settings and implementation initiatives.

In communities where country foods (locally harvested foods: land animals, fish, birds, plants) are integrated in the daily diet, as is the case in remote northern regions where food security is a challenge, such foods can potentially be a significant route of contaminant exposure. To assess this issue, a biomonitoring project was implemented among Dene/Mйtis communities of the Dehcho region of the Northwest Territories, Canada. Methods: Participants completed dietary surveys (i.e., a food frequency questionnaire and 24-h recall) to estimate food consumption patterns as well as a Health Messages Survey to evaluate the awareness and perception of contaminants and consumption notices. Biological sampling of hair, urine and blood was conducted. Toxic metals (e.g., mercury, lead, cadmium), essential metals (e.g., copper, nickel, zinc), fatty acids, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were measured in samples. Results: The levels of contaminants in blood, hair and urine for the majority of participants were below the available guidance values for mercury, cadmium, lead and uranium. However, from the 279 participants, approximately 2% were invited to provide follow up samples, mainly for elevated mercury level. Also, at the population level, blood lead (GM: 11 ?g/L) and blood cadmium (GM: 0.53 ?g/L) were slightly above the Canadian Health Measures Survey data. Therefore, although country foods occasionally contain elevated levels of particular contaminants, human exposures to these metals remained similar to those seen in the Canadian general population. In addition, dietary data showed the importance and diversity of country foods across participating communities, with the consumption of an average of 5.1% of total calories from wild-harvested country foods. Conclusion: This project completed in the Mackenzie Valley of the Northwest Territories fills a data gap across other biomonitoring studies in Canada as it integrates community results, will support stakeholders in the development of public health strategies, and will inform environmental health issue prioritization. © 2018 The Author(s).",Biomarker; Biomonitoring; Dene; Exposure; First nations; Metals; North; Risk assessment; Traditional foods,,,BioMed Central Ltd.,7787367,,APHEE,,English,Arch.

The tourism sector has likewise pledged to reduce its GHG emissions (?70% by 2050); however, current emission trends would result in a tripling in the same timeframe. In order to understand how the sector understands the decarbonisation challenge, 17 senior tourism leaders were interviewed with regard to their perspectives on the risks and opportunities associated with climate change impacts and action. Respondents affirmed that the climate is already changing, fuelled by human activities, including tourism, and that its impacts on society and tourism will be largely negative and devastating in some regions. Opinion was divided regarding mitigation timelines, the compatibility of continued tourism growth with Paris Climate Agreement decarbonisation goals, and the role of technology and governance in reducing emissions. The paper examines leaders’ perspectives in terms of “belief systems” that interpret information in decision-making, as well as forms of agnogenesis; this is, the fabrication of uncertainty to justify non-action. Belief systems and agnogenesis are thought to represent important barriers to progress on the decarbonisation of tourism, as they are for the global low-carbon transition. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This article investigates the development of LOS for 32 destinations in developed and emerging economies as well as Small Islands and Developing States (SIDS). The analysis is based on UNWTO data for 478.5 million international tourist arrivals, or about 40% of the global total in 2015, for the years 1995–2015. Results show considerable differences in LOS between destinations, with a global trend of falling LOS, by 14.8% over the study period. However, in individual destination countries, LOS was found to be increasing. Analyses of LOS trends reveal that these can neither be explained by distance–decay relationships nor business to leisure arrival ratios.

The interaction suppresses quantum coherence and forces the system towards a steady state. Such dissipative processes are captured by the paradigmatic spin-boson model, describing a two-state particle, the ""spin"", interacting with an environment formed by harmonic oscillators. A fundamental question to date is to what extent intense coherent driving impacts a strongly dissipative system. Here we investigate experimentally and theoretically a superconducting qubit strongly coupled to an electromagnetic environment and subjected to a coherent drive. This setup realizes the driven Ohmic spin-boson model. We show that the drive reinforces environmental suppression of quantum coherence, and that a coherent-to-incoherent transition can be achieved by tuning the drive amplitude. An out-of-equilibrium detailed balance relation is demonstrated. These results advance fundamental understanding of open quantum systems and bear potential for the design of entangled light-matter states. © 2018 The Author(s).",,amplitude; electromagnetic method; experimental study; numerical model; quantitative analysis; superconductivity; theoretical study; acceleration; Article; boson; comparative study; controlled study; electromagnetism; energy transfer; mathematical parameters; molecular probe; particle size; proton transport; quantum mechanics; steady state; superconductivity,,Nature Publishing Group,20411723,,,29643365,English,Nat.

Novel design and mechanisms to encapsulate lithium polysulfides are greatly desired by high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries towards practical applications. Herein, we report a strategy of utilizing anthraquinone, a natural abundant organic molecule, to suppress dissolution and diffusion of polysulfides species through redox reactions during cycling. The keto groups of anthraquinone play a critical role in forming strong Lewis acid-based chemical bonding. This mechanism leads to a long cycling stability of sulfur-based electrodes. With a high sulfur content of ?73%, a low capacity decay of 0.019% per cycle for 300 cycles and retention of 81.7% over 500 cycles at 0.5 C rate can be achieved.

Notwithstanding these recommendations, the use of RCTs in the evaluation of BSPs has been resisted by (almost) all. Policy makers and managers are correct in their reluctance to undertake RCT-based evaluations for four reasons. First, while RCTs require the random allocation of support, judicious programmes select firms on the basis of potential and amenability to support. Second, while RCTs require treatments that exhibit low variability, the most effective BSPs draw upon substantive knowledge to provide support that is customised. Third, BSPs aim to produce outliers—firms whose performance is exceptional. When outliers are present, very large samples will be required to produce reliable results. Finally, an RCT may not yield a meaningful contribution to knowledge. The strength of an RCT is its ability to estimate the magnitude of the treatment effect under controlled conditions. But where much depends on the nature of participants and circumstances, we seek evidence of what works, for whom, in which circumstances, and why. © 2018, The Author(s).",,,,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,20551045,,,,English,Palgrave Commun.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064908724,

This article presents research that used re/insurance catastrophe models to estimate the influence of climate change on flood-related losses. The geographic focus of the study was the Canadian Maritimes—specifically Halifax, Nova Scotia—and it sought to determine how municipal risks due to rainfall-driven riverine floods could change as a result of climate change. Results: Findings show that annual flood losses could increase by up to 300% under a business-as-usual climate scenario by the end of the century (i.e., no mitigation or adaptation), even without accounting for changes to the built environment that could increase exposure (e.g., no population or economic growth). Conclusions: Increasing flood risk demands an open discussion about how much risk is acceptable to the community and what controls on further growth of exposure are necessary. Moreover, projected increases in flood losses put into question long-term insurability in the Halifax area, and highlight a broader problem facing manyother areas in Canada as well. © 2018, The Author(s).",Catastrophe losses; Climate change; Flood; Insurance; Public policy; Risk management,,,Springer,21978670,,,,English,Geoenvironmental Disasters,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060300944,

While much has been written about historical Confucian ideas about tributary relations, IPE scholars have devoted little attention to another Chinese intellectual tradition that challenged those ideas in the 19th century: Chinese economic nationalism. In the wake of the two Opium Wars, early Chinese economic nationalist thinkers urged Chinese authorities to embrace a new priority of boosting the country's wealth and power (fuqiang) through an outward-oriented, state-led development strategy. Their ideas shared some similarities with Listian economic nationalism that became popular elsewhere in the world at this time, but they were developed without direct engagement with that Westernoriginated thought. The indigenous roots of 19th-century Chinese economic nationalism also gave it characteristics that distinguished it in interesting ways from the Western version of economic nationalism in that era. In addition to widening our understandings of Chinese traditions of IPE thought, this study of the distinct content and origins of early Chinese economic nationalism contributes to: recent efforts to overcome the Western-centric foundations of IPE thought, literature exploring the diversity of economic nationalist thought and its diffusion in the 19th century, and analyses of China's post-1978 foreign economic policy. © The Author(s) 2018.

The low density of magnesium alloys and their high specific strength relative to steel and aluminum alloys make them promising candidates for automotive light-weighting but standard phenomenological plasticity models cannot adequately capture the complex plastic response of these materials. In this study, the constitutive plastic behavior of a rare-earth magnesium alloy sheet, ZEK100 (O-temper), was considered at room temperature, under quasi-static conditions. The CPB06 yield criterion for hcp materials was employed along with a non-associative flow rule in which the yield function and plastic potential were calibrated for a range of plastic deformation levels to account for evolving anisotropy under proportional loading. The non-associative flow rule has not previously been applied to magnesium alloys which require the use of flexible constitutive models to capture the severe anisotropy and its evolution with plastic deformation. The non-associative flow rule can provide the required flexibility by decoupling the yield function and plastic potential. For the associative flow rule, such flexibility can only be achieved by multiple linear transformations of the stress tensor resulting in expensive models for calibration and simulations. The constitutive model was implemented as a user material subroutine (UMAT) within the commercial finite element software, LS-DYNA, for general 3-D stress states along with an interpolation technique to consider the evolution of anisotropy based upon the plastic work. To evaluate the accuracy of the implemented model, predictions of a single-element model were compared with the experimental results in terms of flow stresses and plastic flow directions under various proportional loading conditions and along different test directions. Finally, to assess the predictive capabilities of the model, full-scale simulations of coupon-level formability experiments were performed and compared with experimental results in terms of far-field load-displacement and local strain paths. Using these experiments, the constitutive model was evaluated across the full range of representative stress states for sheet metal forming operations. It was shown that the predictions of the model were in very good agreement with experimental data. © 2018 by the authors.

Models that are built to analyze land-use change can help us understand the causes and effects of change, which can provide support and evidence to land-use planning and land-use policies to eliminate or alleviate potential negative outcomes. A variety of modelling approaches have been developed and implemented to represent land-use change, in which statistical methods are often used in the classification of land use as well as to test hypotheses about the significance of potential drivers of land-use change. The utility of statistical models is found in the ease of their implementation and application as well as their ability to provide a general representation of land-use change given a limited amount of time, resources, and data. Despite the use of many different statistical methods for modelling land-use change, comparison among more than two statistical methods is rare and an evaluation of the performance of a combination of different statistical methods with the same dataset is lacking. The presented research fills this gap in land-use modelling literature using four statistical methods-Markov chain, logistic regression, generalized additive models and survival analysis-to quantify their ability to represent land-use change. The four methods were compared across three dimensions: accuracy (overall and by land-use type), sample size, and spatial independence via conventional and spatial cross-validation. Our results show that the generalized additive model outperformed the other three models in terms of overall accuracy and was the best for modelling most land-use changes with both conventional and spatial cross-validation regardless of sample size. Logistic regression and survival analysis were more accurate for specific land-use types, and Markov chain was able to represent those changes that could not be modeled by other approaches due to sample size restrictions. Spatial cross-validation accuracies were slightly lower than the conventional cross-validation accuracies.

The amino acids investigated were chosen based on their differences in side chain polarity and potential impact on this surface affinity. While calcium pre-saturation of the calcium-deficient ns-nHA was not found to improve attachment of any of the amino acids studied, the polarity and fraction of ionized functional side groups was found to have a significant impact on this attachment. Overall, amino acid attachment to ns-nHA was not solely reliant on carboxyl groups. In fact, it seems that amine groups also notably interacted with the negative ns-nHA surface and increased the degree of surface binding achieved. As a result, glycine and lysine had greater attachment to ns-nHA than aspartic acid under the reaction conditions studied. Lastly, our results suggest that a layer of each amino acid forms at the surface of ns-nHA, with aspartic acid attachment the most stable and its surface coverage the least of the three amino acids studied. © 2018, The Author(s).",,,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,,English,Sci.

Consequently, numerous strains of rhizobia possess the ability to decrease plant ethylene levels by the expression of the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase or via the production of rhizobitoxine, thus, leading to an increased ability to nodulate leguminous plants. Nevertheless, not much is understood about the prevalence of these ethylene modulation genes in different rhizobial groups nor their role in the evolution of the symbiotic process. In this work, we analyze the prevalence and evolution of the enzymes ACC deaminase (AcdS) and dihydrorhizobitoxine desaturase (RtxC) in 395 NodC+ genomes from different rhizobial strains isolated from a wide range of locations and plant hosts, and discuss their importance in the evolution of the symbiotic process. The obtained results show that AcdS and RtxC are differentially prevalent in rhizobial groups, indicating the existence of several selection mechanisms governed by the rhizobial strain itself and its evolutionary origin, the environment, and, importantly, the leguminous plant host (co-evolution). Moreover, it was found that the prevalence of AcdS and RtxC is increased in Bradyrhizobium and Paraburkholderia, and lower in other groups. Data obtained from phylogenetic, evolutionary as well as gene localization analysis support the previous hypotheses regarding the ancient origin of the nodulation abilities in Bradyrhizobium and Paraburkholderia, and brings a new perspective for the importance of ethylene modulation genes in the development of the symbiotic process. The acquisition of AcdS by horizontal gene transfer and a positive selection in other rhizobial groups indicates that this enzyme plays an important role in the nodulation process of many rhizobia. On the other hand, RtxC is negatively selected in most symbioses. Understanding the evolution of ethylene modulation genes in rhizobia may be the key to the development of new strategies aiming for an increased nodulation and nitrogen fixation process. © 2018",Biotechnology; Ecology; Evolution; Microbiology; Plant biology,,,Elsevier Ltd,24058440,,,,English,Heliyon,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058685193,

There are many reasons for this, centered around substantial obstacles in developing clinically useful metabolomic biomarkers. Most significant is the need for interdisciplinary teams with expertise in metabolomics, analysis of complex clinical and metabolomic data, and clinical care. Importantly, the clinical need must precede biomarker discovery, and the experimental design for discovery and validation must reflect the purpose of the biomarker. Standard operating procedures for procuring and handling samples must be developed from the beginning, to ensure experimental integrity. Assay design is another challenge, as there is not much precedent informing this. Another obstacle is that it is not yet clear how to protect any intellectual property related to metabolomic biomarkers. Viewing a metabolomic biomarker as a natural phenomenon would inhibit patent protection and potentially stifle commercial interest. However, demonstrating that a metabolomic biomarker is actually a derivative of a natural phenomenon that requires innovation would enhance investment in this field. Finally, effective knowledge translation strategies must be implemented, which will require engagement with end users (clinicians and lab physicians), patient advocate groups, policy makers, and payer organizations. Addressing each of these issues comprises the framework for introducing a metabolomic biomarker to practice. © 2018 by the authors.",Biomarkers; Knowledge translation; Metabolomics,,,MDPI AG,22181989,,,,English,Metabolites,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054748093,

However, the connection between female politicians and population health warrants more significant attention. This study takes advantage of differences among Canadian provinces to evaluate the effect of women in government on age-standardized all-cause mortality rates, to assess the potential mediating role of government spending, and to determine the role played by political partisanship. Time-series cross-sectional data are retrieved from the Canadian Socio-Economic Information Management System II Tables for 1976–2009 (10 provinces and 34 years = 340 cases). Cumulative women in government is measured as the cumulative seats held by female politicians as a percentage of provincial seats since 1960. Political partisanship is measured as the cumulative seats held by female politicians in left-wing, centre, and right-wing parties as a percentage of provincial seats since 1960. Government spending is measured as the average of standard scores of four provincial expenditures: medical care, preventive care, other social services, and post-secondary education. Health is measured as total, male and female age-standardized mortality rates per 1000 population (all causes of death). Estimation techniques include the Prais-Winsten regressions with panel-corrected SEs, a first-order autocorrelation correction model, and fixed-unit effects, adjusted for alternative factors. We find that as the cumulative average percentage of women in government has historically risen, total, male, and female mortality rates tend to be lower, net of alternative explanations. Government spending partially mediates the effect of women in government on mortality rates. Moreover, increases in female politicians from left-wing, centre, and right-wing parties are all significantly associated with decreases in mortality rates. Women in government can bring about desirable changes in population health. Our work encourages more debate and research about quotas and other measures designed to level the political playing field for women. © 2018 The Authors",,adult; all cause mortality; article; education; female; government; human; information system; major clinical study; male; medical care; mortality rate; population health; public figure; social work; time series analysis; wing,,Elsevier Ltd,23528273,,,,English,SSM Popul.

The pixelated unit cell is basically a dual-band resonator loaded with two resistors which model the input impedance of a power combining circuit in a complete harvesting system. To design the unit cell, a topology optimization approach based on pixelization of the surface of the unit cell and application of a binary optimization algorithm is used. The optimization goal is set to maximize harvesting efficiency at 2.45 GHz and 6 GHz. In our design, full symmetry of the unit cell is considered to achieve insensitivity to the polarization of the incident wave. Once, the unit cell is designed, as a proof of the concept, a metasurface harvester composed of 9 Ч 9 pixelated cells is designed. The full-wave electromagnetic simulation results demonstrate that the proposed metasurface absorbs the incident electromagnetic wave energy with nearly unity efficiency at both frequencies of interest and irrespective the polarization of the incident field while simultaneously delivering the absorbed power to the loads. To validate the simulations, the metasurface harvester is fabricated and tested in an anechoic chamber.

Huntington disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. A spectrum of PTMs have been shown to modify the normal functions of HTT, including proteolysis, phosphorylation and lipidation, but the full contribution of these PTMs to the molecular pathogenesis of HD remains unclear. In this study, we examine all commonly occurring missense mutations in HTT to identify potential human modifiers of HTT PTMs relevant to HD biology. We reveal a SNP that modifies post-Translational myristoylation of HTT, resulting in downstream alterations to toxic HTT proteolysis in human cells. This is the first SNP shown to functionally modify a PTM in HD and the first validated genetic modifier of post-Translational myristoylation.

Briefly, mixed mode SPME fibers were inserted into the muscle for 20 min extraction, and then the fibers were desorbed in an optimal mixture of solvents. The obtained lipid profile was then compared and contrasted to that obtained with employment of ex vivo SPME and solid-liquid extraction (SLE) from fish muscle tissue belonging to the same group of fish, following a one-year storage period. Ex vivo SPME analysis of stored muscle samples revealed 10-fold decrease in the number of detected molecular features in comparison to in vivo study. Moreover, in vivo microsampling enabled the identification of different classes of bioactive lipids, including fatty acyls, not present in the lipid profile obtained through ex vivo SPME and SLE, suggesting the alterations occurring in the unbound lipid fraction of the system under study during the storage and also indicating the advantage of the in vivo extraction approach. © 2018 The Author(s).",,,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,,English,Sci.

A subset of HIV surveillance data in Canada with detailed and compatible variables is pooled for statistical analysis. The study population is Men having Sex with Men (MSM) in Canada from the pooled data. Estimated parameters regarding the HIV epidemic in the study population show that, across age strata, the number of new infections is distributed differently from the number of people living with HIV. A nonlinear programming algorithm is developed regarding which strata should be considered for repeated testing. Among strata in which repeated testing is considered, the optimal frequency of testing is calculated by stratum to minimize the expected number of tests per year. Scenarios and options that all fulfil the UNAIDS vision are presented. In addition to minimizing the expected number of tests per year, other considerations are also examined such as annual testing in selected strata and the tolerance to imperfect implementation of the testing program with low coverage or uptake rates. © 2018",,,,Elsevier B.V.,22116923,,,,English,Oper.

Many different applications exist for displaying a given electronic document, and users rightfully assume that documents will be rendered similarly independently of the application used. However, this is not always the case, and these inconsistencies, regardless of their causes—bugs in the application or the file itself—can become critical sources of miscommunication. In this paper, we present a study on the correctness of PDF documents and readers. We start by manually investigating a large number of real-world PDF documents to understand the frequency and characteristics of cross-reader inconsistencies, and find that such inconsistencies are common—13.5% PDF files are inconsistently rendered by at least one popular reader. We then propose an approach to detect and localize the source of such inconsistencies automatically. We evaluate our automatic approach on a large corpus of over 230 K documents using 11 popular readers and our experiments have detected 30 unique bugs in these readers and files. We also reported 33 bugs, some of which have already been confirmed or fixed by developers. © 2018, The Author(s).",Cross-software inconsistencies; Document correctness; Error-message clustering; Image comparison,Rendering (computer graphics); Automatic approaches; Bank statements; Cross-software inconsistencies; Document correctness; Electronic document; Error messages; Image comparison; Large corpora; Program debugging,,Springer New York LLC,13823256,,ESENF,,English,Empir Software Eng,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043364555,

For instance, over-fishing of parrotfish - an important grazer of macroalgae that can prevent destructive overgrowth of macroalgae - has threatened reef ecosystems in recent decades and stimulated conservation efforts such as the formation of marine protected areas. Here we develop a mathematical model of coupled socio-ecological interactions between reef dynamics and conservation opinion dynamics to better understand how natural and human factors interact individually and in combination to determine coral reef cover. We find that the coupling opinion and reef systems generates complex dynamics that are difficult to anticipate without use of a model. For instance, instead of converging to a stable state of constant coral cover and conservationist opinion, the system can oscillate between low and high live coral cover as human opinion oscillates in a boom-bust cycle between complacency and concern. Out of various possible parameter manipulations, we also find that raising awareness of coral reef endangerment best avoids counter-productive nonlinear feedbacks and always increases and stabilizes live coral reef cover. In conclusion, an improved understanding of coupled opinion-reef dynamics under anthrogenic stressors is possible using coupled socio-ecological models, and such models should be further researched. © 2018 The Author(s).",,article; awareness; Caribbean; coral reef; human,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,29416056,English,Sci.

A mosaic ecosystem is one consisting of adjacent, coexisting patches of highly distinct naturally occurring land states (in this case, shola forest and natural grassland). Changes in the landscape since the nineteenth century have severely impacted the shola-grassland mosaic and challenged the traditional lifestyles of the indigenous Toda people. However, the responses of traditional Toda socio-ecological perspectives and landscape management to these changes have not been explored through population surveys. Here, using a survey method, the article explores traditional Toda perspectives of ecosystem value and landmanagement practices. The survey consists of interviews of 50 respondents belonging to 24 munds (villages), covering ten clans, neighbouring mosaic lands, plantations and agricultural areas. The findings show that traditional socio-ecological landscape management is robust and has persisted despite marked ecological and socio-economic changes during the nineteenth and twenty-first centuries, and despite frequent gathering of land management advice from non-Toda. Elements of traditional socio-ecological knowledge that have persisted include prevalent collective traditional decision-making and long-held preferences for a landscape composition with a strong mosaic component. The highly robust nature of Toda socio-ecological culture and land management suggests that the Todas have a valuable role to play in supporting the long-term persistence of the shola-grassland mosaic. Increasing their stewardship role would help conserve this endangered and highly biodiverse ecosystem, while at the same time preserving a unique indigenous culture. © 2018, The Author(s).",,,,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,20551045,,,,English,Palgrave Commun.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065039931,

This multi-stressor landscape for amphibian species at risk led to a collaborative stakeholder approach for habitat restoration and species recovery. The main project goal was to increase the quantity and quality of lowland wetland habitat by reconnecting known amphibian-breeding sites with constructed and/or enhanced small ponds. Long-term amphibian monitoring data were used to determine strategic locations for wetland construction and/or enhancement. Habitat enhancement outcomes (N total = 21 sites) since 2006 include 10 newly constructed ponds, enhancement of eight re-contoured ponds after historic infilling, and invasive predatory species removal at three sites. Project ponds were monitored annually (2007 to 2014) for calling frogs, the presence of eggs, and metamorphic emergence. Early signs of colonization and metamorphic success for Great Basin Spadefoot (Spea intermontana) (N = 13 sites) and Pacific treefrog (Pseudacris regilla) (N = 7 sites) populations have been observed, however no records of Blotched tiger salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium) colonization has been detected. Wetland habitat construction and enhancement have doubled the number of available fishless ponds to support breeding within the study area and engaged landowners through voluntary stewardship. Whether constructed or enhanced ponds have aided species recovery is unclear, though the colonization and successful metamorphosis of some species provides early supporting evidence that it will. © 2018 by the authors.",Agroecosystems; Amphibian; Ecological planning; Terrestrial habitat; Wetland restoration,agricultural ecosystem; amphibian; environmental restoration; monitoring; pond; terrestrial environment; wetland; British Columbia; Canada; Okanagan Valley; Ambystoma; Ambystoma tigrinum melanostictum; Amphibia; Anura; Pseudacris regilla; Spea intermontana,,MDPI AG,14242818,,,,English,Diversity,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062340207,

Safety is achieved by adding to the theory gauged vectorlike fermions and by employing recently developed large number-of-flavor techniques and results. We show that the gauge, scalar quartic and Yukawa couplings achieve an interacting ultraviolet fixed point below the Planck scale. The minimal model is a relevant example of a standard model extension in which unification of all type of couplings occurs because of a dynamical principle, i.e., the presence of an ultraviolet fixed point. This extension differs from the usual grand unified theories scenario in which only gauge couplings unify and become free with the remaining couplings left unsafe.

In this study, the impacts of charging infrastructure on the effectiveness of different EV operational modes were simulated using a multi-component modelling approach, which accounts for both stochastic EV fleet charging behaviors as well as optimal energy vector dispatch operation. Moreover, a campus microgrid case study was presented to demonstrate the various design factors and impacts of charging infrastructure implementation affecting EV fleet adoption and operation. Based on results from the study, it was shown that charging infrastructure should be adopted in excess of the minimum required to satisfy EV charging for driving needs. In addressing uncontrolled charging behaviors, additional charging infrastructure improves EV owner convenience and reduces queuing duration. Meanwhile, controlled charging strategies benefit from increased resilience against uncertain charging behavior and operate more optimally in systems subject to time-of-use (TOU) electricity pricing. Lastly, it was demonstrated that successful vehicle-to-grid (V2G) implementation requires charging infrastructure to emulate the availability and fast response characteristics of stationary energy storage systems, which translates to excess charging port availability, long EV plug-in durations, and bi-directional power flow capabilities well beyond the level 2 charging standard. © 2018 by the authors.",Controlled charging; Electric vehicle; Optimization; Smart grid; Vehicle-to-grid,Charging (batteries); Electric energy storage; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Bi-directional power flows; Charging infrastructures; Controlled charging; Electricity pricing; Smart grid; Stationary energy storages; Uncontrolled charging; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Vehicle-to-grid,,MDPI AG,19961073,,,,English,Energies,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059310581,

Here we investigate the activity of human AMP LL37 against Escherichia coli by integrating quantitative, population and single-cell level experiments with theoretical modeling. We observe an unexpected, rapid absorption and retention of a large number of LL37 peptides by E. coli cells upon the inhibition of their growth, which increases population survivability. This transition occurs more likely in the late stage of cell division cycles. Cultures with high cell density exhibit two distinct subpopulations: a non-growing population that absorb peptides and a growing population that survive owing to the sequestration of the AMPs by others. A mathematical model based on this binary picture reproduces the rather surprising observations, including the increase of the minimum inhibitory concentration with cell density (even in dilute cultures) and the extensive lag in growth introduced by sub-lethal dosages of LL37 peptides. © Snoussi et al.",,"cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL 37; antiinfective agent; antimicrobial cationic peptide; CAP18 lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; protein binding; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; calibration; cell counting; cell culture; cell cycle; cell density; cell division; cell growth; cell interaction; cell size; cell subpopulation; cell survival; colorimetry; Escherichia coli; growth inhibition; human; live cell imaging; mathematical model; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; phase contrast microscopy; drug effect; Escherichia coli; growth, development and aging; kinetics; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; microbial viability; theoretical model; Anti-Infective Agents; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Escherichia coli; Humans; Kinetics; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Microbial Viability; Models, Theoretical; Protein Binding",,eLife Sciences Publications Ltd,2050084X,,,30560784,English,eLife,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058724393,

Identifying individual and environmental needs and barriers at local levels is important to inform community-based interventions. This qualitative study used interviews based on constructs from social cognitive theory. 101 adolescent mothers, family members, health-related personnel and community workers in Budondo sub-county (Jinja district), eastern Uganda were interviewed. Young mothers had needs, related to going back to school, home-based small businesses; social needs, care support and belonging to their families, employment, shelter, clothing, personal land and animals, medical care and delivery materials. Barriers to meeting their needs included: lack of skills in income generation and food preparation, harsh treatment, pregnancy and childcare costs, lack of academic qualifications, lack of adequate shelter and land, lack of foods to make complementary feeds for infants, insufficient access to medicines, tailored health care and appropriate communications. Using the social cognitive framework, this study identified myriad needs of young mothers and barriers to improving maternal/child nutrition and health. Adolescent-mother-and-child-friendly environments are needed at local levels while continuing to reduce broader socio-cultural and economic barriers to health equity. Findings may help direct future interventions for improved adolescent maternal/child nutrition and health. © 2018 by the authors.

Here, we present the use of supervised machine learning to treat differential mobility spectrometry – mass spectrometry data for ten topological classes of drug candidates. We demonstrate that the gas-phase clustering behavior probed in our experiments can be used to predict the candidates’ condensed phase molecular properties, such as cell permeability, solubility, polar surface area, and water/octanol distribution coefficient. All of these measurements are performed in minutes and require mere nanograms of each drug examined. Moreover, by tuning gas temperature within the differential mobility spectrometer, one can fine tune the extent of ion-solvent clustering to separate subtly different molecular geometries and to discriminate molecules of very similar physicochemical properties. © 2018, The Author(s).",,octanol; bioassay; drug; experimental study; machine learning; mass spectrometry; molecular analysis; physicochemical property; research work; spectrometry; Article; cell membrane permeability; controlled study; geometry; hydrogen bond; machine learning; mass spectrometry; molecular size; physical chemistry; protonation; spectroscopy; supervised machine learning; surface area,,Nature Publishing Group,20411723,,,30504922,English,Nat.

Health authorities require information about current associations between health outcomes and weather or climate, vulnerable populations, projections of future risks and adaptation opportunities in order to reduce exposures, empower individuals to take needed protective actions and build climate-resilient health systems. An increasing number of health authorities from local to national levels seek this information by conducting climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments. While assessments can provide valuable information to plan for climate change impacts, the results of many studies are not helping to build the global evidence-base of knowledge in this area. They are also often not integrated into adaptation decision making, sometimes because the health sector is not involved in climate change policy making processes at the national level. Significant barriers related to data accessibility, a limited number of climate and health models, uncertainty in climate projections, and a lack of funding and expertise, particularly in developing countries, challenge health authority efforts to conduct rigorous assessments and apply the findings. This paper examines the evolution of climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments, including guidance developed for such projects, the number of assessments that have been conducted globally and implementation of the findings to support health adaptation action. Greater capacity building that facilitates assessments from local to national scales will support collaborative efforts to protect health from current climate hazards and future climate change. Health sector officials will benefit from additional resources and partnership opportunities to ensure that evidence about climate change impacts on health is effectively translated into needed actions to build health resilience. © 2018 by the authors.

Here we investigated the extent with which assumed light from above preferences are affected by body orientation and the orientation of the retina relative to gravity. We tested the ability to extract shape-from-shading with seven human male observers positioned in multiple orientations relative to gravity using a modified KUKA anthropomorphic robot arm. Observers made convex-concave judgments of a central monocularly viewed stimulus with orientations of a shading gradient consistent with being lit from one of 24 simulated illumination directions. By positioning observers in different roll-tilt orientations relative to gravity and when supine, we were able to monitor change in the light-from-above prior (the orientation at which a shaded disk appears maximally convex). The results confirm previous findings that the light-from-above prior changes with body orientation relative to gravity. Interestingly, the results varied also with retinal orientation as well as an additional component that was approximately twice the frequency of retinal orientation. We use a modelling approach to show that the data are well predicted by summing retinal orientation with cross-multiplied utricle and saccule signals of the vestibular system, yielding gravity-dependent biases in the ability to extract shape-from-shading. We conclude that priors such as light coming from above appear to be constantly updated by neural processes that monitor self-orientation to achieve optimal object recognition over moderate deviations from upright posture at the cost of poor recognition when extremely tilted relative to gravity. © 2018, The Author(s).",,adult; article; body position; decision making; gravity; human; illumination; male; recognition; retina; robotics; saccule; simulation; stimulus; utricle,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,30310139,English,Sci.

A reliable identification of lattice symmetry is a crucial first step for materials characterization and analytics. Current methods require a user-specified threshold, and are unable to detect average symmetries for defective structures. Here, we propose a machine learning-based approach to automatically classify structures by crystal symmetry. First, we represent crystals by calculating a diffraction image, then construct a deep learning neural network model for classification. Our approach is able to correctly classify a dataset comprising more than 100,000 simulated crystal structures, including heavily defective ones. The internal operations of the neural network are unraveled through attentive response maps, demonstrating that it uses the same landmarks a materials scientist would use, although never explicitly instructed to do so.

The IOP of male Sprague-Dawley rats was raised in one eye to ~35 mmHg for 1 hour/day on 6 days each week using vascular loops. Single-flash ERG traces and volumetric UHR-OCT images of the ONH were acquired from both eyes before, during and after IOP elevations at weeks 1, 5 and 9 of the study. The UHR-OCT images showed depression of the posterior eye around the ONH during the IOP elevations, the magnitude of which increased significantly from week 1 to week 9 (p = 0.01). The ERG a-wave and b-wave amplitudes increased temporarily during IOP elevations and returned to normal ~30 minutes after loop removal. Recurrent intermittent IOP spikes caused > 30% decrease in the ERG a-wave and b-wave amplitudes measured during the IOP elevations over the course of 2 months. This study suggests that recurrent, relatively short-duration IOP spikes for extended period of time are associated with peri-ONH tissue hypercompliance and reduced retinal functional response to visual stimulation during acute IOP elevation. © 2018 The Author(s).",,adult; animal experiment; article; controlled study; intraocular pressure; male; nonhuman; optic disk; optical coherence tomography; rat; retina; spike; Sprague Dawley rat; visual stimulation,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,,English,Sci.

Traditional research methods are poorly suited to operationalize the agile, iterative trials required to evidence and optimize these digitally mediated interventions. Objective: We sought to contribute a resource to support the quantification, analysis, and visualization of analytic indicators of effective engagement with mHealth apps for chronic conditions. Methods: We applied user-centered design methods to design and develop an Analytics Platform to Evaluate Effective Engagement (APEEE) with consumer mHealth apps for chronic conditions and implemented the platform to analyze both retrospective and prospective data generated from a smartphone-based pain self-management app called iCanCope for young people with chronic pain. Results: Through APEEE, we were able to automate the process of defining, operationalizing, and evaluating effective engagement with iCanCope. Configuring the platform to integrate with the app was feasible and provided investigators with a resource to consolidate, analyze, and visualize engagement data generated by participants in real time. Preliminary efforts to evaluate APEEE showed that investigators perceived the platform to be an acceptable evaluative resource and were satisfied with its design, functionality, and performance. Investigators saw potential in APEEE to accelerate and augment evidence generation and expressed enthusiasm for adopting the platform to support their evaluative practice once fully implemented.

So far, a comprehensive understanding of the magnetic excitations in such 2D magnets remains missing. Here we report polarized micro-Raman spectroscopy studies on a 2D honeycomb ferromagnet CrI 3 . We show the definitive evidence of two sets of zero-momentum spin waves at frequencies of 2.28 terahertz (THz) and 3.75 THz, respectively, that are three orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional ferromagnets. By tracking the thickness dependence of both spin waves, we reveal that both are surface spin waves with lifetimes an order of magnitude longer than their temporal periods. Our results of two branches of high-frequency, long-lived surface spin waves in 2D CrI 3 demonstrate intriguing spin dynamics and intricate interplay with fluctuations in the 2D limit, thus opening up opportunities for ultrafast spintronics incorporating 2D magnets. © 2018, The Author(s).",,frequency analysis; magnetic method; Raman spectroscopy; two-dimensional modeling; Article; crystal; dispersion; magnetism; molecular dynamics; Raman spectrometry; surface property; temperature dependence; thickness,,Nature Publishing Group,20411723,,,30504853,English,Nat.

This model is incorrect for basin-filling cirque glaciers, as we have demonstrated at West Washmawapta Glacier, a small glacier in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Here we report observations at the same glacier that assess whether complex temporal variations of flow also occur. For parts of three summers, we measured daily displacements of the glacier surface. In one year, four short-duration speed-up events were recorded. Three of the events occurred during the intervals of warmest weather, when melt was most rapid; the fourth event occurred immediately following heavy rain. We interpret the speed-up events as manifestations of enhanced water inputs to the glacier bed and associated slip lubrication by increased water volumes and pressures. No further speed-ups occurred in the final month of the melt season, despite warm temperatures and several rainstorms; the dominant subglacial water system likely transformed from one of poorly connected cavities to one with an efficient channel network. The seasonal evolution of hydrology and flow resembles behaviors documented at other, larger temperate glaciers and indicates that analyses of cirque erosion cannot rely on simple assumptions about ice dynamics. © The Author(s) 2018 This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",glacial geomorphology; ice velocity; mountain glaciers; subglacial processes,alpine environment; cirque; flow velocity; geomorphology; glacier flow; mountain region; spatial variation; subglacial deposit; valley glacier; British Columbia; Canada; Canada; Norway; Rocky Mountains; West Washmawapta Glacier,,Cambridge University Press,221430,,,,English,J.

Using the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), we identified initiators (365-day washout period) of DPP4 inhibitors and relevant comparators including initiators of sulfonylureas, metformin, thiazolidinediones, and insulin between January 2007 and January 2016 to quantify the association between DPP4 inhibitors and three acute health events – acute kidney injury, respiratory tract infections, and acute pancreatitis. The associations between drug and study outcomes were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for deciles of high-dimensional propensity scores and number of additional glucose lowering agents. After controlling for potential confounders, the risk was not significantly increased or decreased for initiators of DPP4 inhibitors compared to sulfonylureas (hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for acute kidney injury: 0.81 [0.56–1.18]; HR for respiratory tract infections: 0.93 [0.84–1.04]; HR for acute pancreatitis 1.03 [0.42–2.52], metformin (HR for respiratory tract infection 0.91 [0.65–1.27]), thiazolidinediones (HR for acute kidney injury: 1.12 [0.60–2.10]; HR for respiratory tract infections: 1.02 [0.86–1.21]; HR for acute pancreatitis: 1.21 [0.25–5.72]), or insulin (HR for acute kidney injury: 1.40 [0.77–2.55]; HR for respiratory tract infections: 0.74 [0.60–0.92]; HR for acute pancreatitis: 1.01 [0.24–4.19]). Initiators of DPP4 inhibitors were associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury when compared to metformin initiators (HR [95% CI] for acute kidney injury: 1.85 [1.10–3.12], although this association was attenuated when DPP4 inhibitor monotherapy was compared to metformin monotherapy exposure as a time-dependent variable (HR 1.39 [0.91–2.11]). Initiation of a DPP4 inhibitor was not associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury, respiratory tract infections, or acute pancreatitis compared to sulfonylureas or other glucose-lowering therapies. © 2018, The Author(s).",,,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,30310100,English,Sci.

This effect was observed in semiconductors like GaAs which has a direct bandgap of very low effective mass and an indirect subband of high effective mass which lies ~300 meV above the former. In contrast to GaAs, bulk silicon has a very high energy spacing (~1 eV) which renders the initiation of transfer-induced NDR unobservable. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT), semi-empirical 10 orbital (sp3d5s?) Tight Binding and Ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) methods we show for the first time that (a) Gunn Effect can be induced in silicon nanowires (SiNW) with diameters of 3.1 nm under +3% strain and an electric field of 5000 V/cm, (b) the onset of NDR in the I-V characteristics is reversibly adjustable by strain and (c) strain modulates the resistivity by a factor 2.3 for SiNWs of normal I-V characteristics i.e. those without NDR. These observations are promising for applications of SiNWs in electromechanical sensors and adjustable microwave oscillators. It is noteworthy that the observed NDC is different in principle from Esaki-Diode and Resonant Tunneling Diodes (RTD) in which NDR originates from tunneling effect. © 2018 The Author(s).",,,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,,English,Sci.

Some of the challenges facing researchers include the limited volume of biofluids, rapid and high-throughput sampling requirements, and the lack of reliable methods. Coupled to the above, growing interest in the monitoring of kinetics and dynamics of miniaturized biosystems has spurred the demand for development of novel and revolutionary methodologies for analysis of biofluids. The applicability of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is investigated as a potential technology to fulfill the aforementioned requirements. As analytes with sufficient diversity in their physicochemical features, nicotine, N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide, and diclofenac were selected as test compounds for the study. The objective was to develop methodologies that would allow repeated non-depletive sampling from 96-well plates, using 100 ?L of sample. Initially, thin film-SPME was investigated. Results revealed substantial depletion and consequent disruption in the system. Therefore, new ultra-thin coated fibers were developed. The applicability of this device to the described sampling scenario was tested by determining the protein binding of the analytes. Results showed good agreement with rapid equilibrium dialysis. The presented method allows high-throughput analysis using small volumes, enabling fast reliable free and total concentration determinations without disruption of system equilibrium. © 2018 The Author(s).",,,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,29348436,English,Sci.

Egypt has been employing waterpipe tobacco labelling for a decade, however, their effectiveness is unknown. Our overall aim was to measure the effectiveness of pictorial health warnings (PHWs) on waterpipe tobacco packs (WTPs) through participant memory recall and to investigate whether they induced behavioural responses in waterpipe smokers and deterred uptake of WTS in non-smokers, examining the differentials of effectiveness among socio-demographic subgroups. Subjects and methods We conducted two surveys including 1490 adult current waterpipe smokers, 73 former waterpipe smokers, and 451 non-smokers in Cairo and a rural village in Egypt between 2015–2017. Participants who noticed PHWs on WTPs were asked questions about salience, communication of health risks, public support, cognitive processing, and self-reported behavioural responses (current waterpipe smokers: reduce consumption, forgo a smoke, quit attempts; former waterpipe smokers: quit; non-smokers: deter WTS initiation). Univariate and multivariable statistical analyses were performed. Results Participants’ mean age was 35 years, mostly males (90.4%), waterpipe smokers (74.0%) and rural residents (59.3%). Approximately two-thirds of participants noticed PHWs on WTPs. Salience was significantly less among females, urban residents and participants with high literacy. More than three-quarters of participants reported that WTS health risks were communicated through the warnings. At least half of participants cognitively processed the warnings: 56.3% thought of the warnings when WTPs were out of sight; non-smokers understood the warnings (83.2%) and discussed them with others (90.3%) significantly more than current (76.0% and 72.5%, respectively) and former waterpipe smokers (81.0% and 61.9%, respectively). Participants reported that PHWs on WTPs motivated 58.5% of waterpipe smokers to think about quitting; 64.5% to reduce their consumption; 42.2% to forgo a smoke; 24.5% to attempt to quit; 57.1% of former waterpipe smokers to successfully quit; and 59.3% of non-smokers to remain smoke-free. Conclusions Findings suggest that inserting PHWs on WTPs is an effective waterpipe tobacco labelling policy. Countries with similarly high rates of WTS should consider adopting WTP PHWs within a comprehensive regulatory framework. © 2018 Mostafa et al.

We extremize various cubic and quartic couplings in the two-to-two scattering amplitudes of vector particles. Saturating these bounds, we encounter known integrable models with O(N) symmetry such as the O(N) Gross-Neveu and non-linear sigma models and the scattering of kinks in the sine-Gordon model. We also considered more general mass spectra for which we move away from the integrable realm. In this regime we find (numerically, through a large N analysis and sometimes even analytically) that the S-matrices saturating the various coupling bounds have an extremely rich structure exhibiting infinite resonances and virtual states in the various kinematical sheets. They are rather exotic in that they admit no particle production yet they do not obey Yang-Baxter equations. We discuss their physical (ir)relevance and speculate, based on some preliminary numerics, that they might be close to more realistic theories with particle production. © 2018, The Author(s).",Field Theories in Lower Dimensions; Integrable Field Theories; Nonperturbative Effects; Scattering Amplitudes,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

These MNPs were subjected to self-assembly with a poly(acrylic acid)-block-poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) double-hydrophilic block copolymer (DHBC), PAA-b-PHEA, to form water-dispersible magnetic polyion complex (MPIC) micelles. Large Fe 3 O 4 crystallites were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and magnetic suspensions of MPIC micelles exhibited improved colloidal stability in aqueous environments over a wide pH and ionic strength range. Biological cells incubated for 48 h with MPIC micelles at the highest concentration (1250 µg of Fe 3 O 4 per mL) had a cell viability of 91%, as compared with 51% when incubated with bare (unprotected) MNPs. Cell internalization, visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and TEM, exhibited strong dependence on the MPIC micelle concentration and incubation time, as also evidenced by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The usefulness of MPIC micelles for cellular radiofrequency magnetic field hyperthermia (MFH) was also confirmed, as the MPIC micelles showed a dual dose-dependent effect (concentration and duration of magnetic field exposure) on the viability of L929 mouse fibroblasts and U87 human glioblastoma epithelial cells. © 2018 by the authors.

We report the findings from a content analysis of audio-recorded discussions of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and benzodiazepine deprescribing in primary care. Methods: Participants were healthcare providers (n = 13) from primary care practices (n = 3) and patients aged ?65 (n = 24) who were chronic users of PPIs or benzodiazepines. The EMPOWER educational brochures were distributed prior to (n = 15) or after (n = 9) the patient’s usual healthcare provider appointment. Conversations were audio-recorded and coded using MEDICODE to analyze who initiated different themes, whether they followed a monologue or dialogue style, and to what extent the thematic content addressed issues pertaining to: ‘dosage/instructions,’ ‘medication action and efficacy,’ ‘risk/adverse effects,’ ‘attitudes/emotions,’ ‘adherence’ and ‘follow up.’ Descriptive analysis of the conversations was performed with comparison between patients who received the EMPOWER brochure before or after their appointments. Results: Patients were mostly women (67%) with a mean age of 74 ± 6?years. For PPI users, prior education resulted in a greater proportion of themes initiated by patients (44% versus 17%) and maintaining dialogue-style conversations (48% versus 28%). Among benzodiazepine users, conversation initiation (52% versus 47%) and conversation style was similar between both groups. The content of deprescribing conversations for PPIs revealed that patients and their healthcare providers focused less on ‘dosage/instructions,’ and more on the ‘medication action and efficacy’ and the necessity for ‘follow up.’ Conversations about stopping benzodiazepines were more likely to stagnate on the ‘if’ rather than the ‘how.’ Conclusion: The initiation, style and content of the conversations varied between PPI and benzodiazepine users, suggesting that healthcare providers will need to tailor deprescribing conversations accordingly. © The Author(s), 2018.",aged; decision-making; deprescribing; education; potentially inappropriate medication; primary health care; public health professional; shared,benzodiazepine; proton pump inhibitor; aged; Article; audio recording; clinical article; clinical practice; content analysis; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; female; follow up; health care personnel; health education; human; interpersonal communication; male; medication compliance; prescription; primary medical care; priority journal; risk factor,,SAGE Publications Ltd,20420986,,,,English,Ther.

Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors in particular lack inversion symmetry, yielding an antisymmetric form of spin-orbit coupling that admits both spin-singlet and spin-triplet components of the superconducting wavefunction. Here, we present an experimental and theoretical study of two intrinsic TMD superconductors with large spin-orbit coupling in the atomic layer limit, metallic 2H-TaS 2 and 2H-NbSe 2 . We investigate the superconducting properties as the material is reduced to monolayer thickness and show that high-field measurements point to the largest upper critical field thus reported for an intrinsic TMD superconductor. In few-layer samples, we find the enhancement of the upper critical field is sustained by the dominance of spin-orbit coupling over weak interlayer coupling, providing additional candidate systems for supporting unconventional superconducting states in two dimensions. © 2018 The Author(s).",,chalcogen; transition element; electron; experimental study; measurement method; superconductivity; theoretical study; topology; transition element; two-dimensional modeling; anisotropy; Article; comparative study; controlled study; crystal; encapsulation; qualitative analysis; superconductivity; surface property; temperature sensitivity; theoretical study; thickness,,Nature Publishing Group,20411723,,,29650994,English,Nat.

Aims/objectives: Our aim was to assess the effect of portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter air cleaner use during pregnancy on fetal growth. Methods: The Ulaanbaatar Gestation and Air Pollution Research (UGAAR) study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial conducted in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Non-smoking pregnant women recruited at ?18 weeks gestation were randomized to an intervention (1–2 air cleaners in homes from early pregnancy until childbirth) or control (no air cleaners) group. Participants were not blinded to their intervention status. Demographic, health, and birth outcome data were obtained via questionnaires and clinic records. We used unadjusted linear and logistic regression and time-to-event analysis to evaluate the intervention. Our primary outcome was birth weight. Secondary outcomes were gestational age-adjusted birth weight, birth length, head circumference, gestational age at birth, and small for gestational age. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01741051). Results: We recruited 540 participants (272 control and 268 intervention) from January 9, 2014 to May 1, 2015. There were 465 live births and 28 losses to follow up. We previously reported a 29% (95% CI: 21, 37%) reduction in indoor PM 2.5 concentrations with portable HEPA filter air cleaner use. The median (25th, 75th percentile) birth weights for control and intervention participants were 3450 g (3150, 3800 g) and 3550 g (3200, 3800 g), respectively (p = 0.34). The intervention was not associated with birth weight (18 g; 95% CI: ?84, 120 g), but in a pre-specified subgroup analysis of 429 term births the intervention was associated with an 85 g (95% CI: 3, 167 g) increase in mean birth weight.

We examined changes in cigarette consumption patterns over a four-year period and determined which factors were associated with smoking transitions. Methods: We used data from a cohort of smokers from the 2008–2012 ITC Mexico Survey administrations to investigate transitions from non-daily (ND; n = 669), daily light (DL; ?5 cigarettes per day (cpd); n = 643), and daily heavy (DH; >5 cpd; n = 761) smoking patterns. To identify which factors (i.e., sociodemographic measures, perceived addiction, quit behavior, social norms) were associated with smoking transitions, we stratified on smoking status at time t (ND, DL, DH) and used multinomial (ND, DL) and binomial (DH) logistic regression to examine transitions (quitting/reducing or increasing versus same level for ND and DL, quitting/reducing versus same level for DH). Results: ND smokers were more likely to quit at follow-up than DL or DH smokers. DH smokers who reduced their consumption to ND were more likely to quit eventually compared to those who continued as DH. Smokers who perceived themselves as addicted had lower odds of quitting/reducing smoking consumption at follow-up compared to smokers who did not, regardless of smoking status at the prior survey. Quit attempts and quit intentions were also associated with quitting/reducing consumption. Conclusions: Reducing consumption may eventually lead to cessation, even for heavier smokers. The findings that perceived addiction and quit behavior were important predictors of changing consumption for all groups may offer insights into potential interventions. © 2018 The Authors",Cessation; Mexico; Perceived addiction; Smoking intensity; Smoking transitions,cigarette smoke; adult; Article; controlled study; demography; female; follow up; human; longitudinal study; male; Mexican; Mexico; outcome assessment; priority journal; smoking; smoking cessation; social norm; tobacco consumption; young adult,,Elsevier Ltd,23528532,,,,English,Addict.

A recent study of the phenomenon using the signal detection theory (SDT) model called into question all theoretical accounts of belief bias by demonstrating that belief-based differences in the ability to discriminate between valid and invalid syllogisms may be an artifact stemming from the use of inappropriate linear measurement models such as analysis of variance (Dube et al., Psychological Review, 117(3), 831–863, 2010). The discrepancy between Dube et al.’s, Psychological Review, 117(3), 831–863 (2010) results and the previous three decades of work, together with former’s methodological criticisms suggests the need to revisit earlier results, this time collecting confidence-rating responses. Using a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis, we reanalyzed a corpus of 22 confidence-rating studies (N = 993). The results indicated that extensive replications using confidence-rating data are unnecessary as the observed receiver operating characteristic functions are not systematically asymmetric. These results were subsequently corroborated by a novel experimental design based on SDT’s generalized area theorem. Although the meta-analysis confirms that believability does not influence discriminability unconditionally, it also confirmed previous results that factors such as individual differences mediate the effect. The main point is that data from previous and future studies can be safely analyzed using appropriate hierarchical methods that do not require confidence ratings. More generally, our results set a new standard for analyzing data and evaluating theories in reasoning. Important methodological and theoretical considerations for future work on belief bias and related domains are discussed. © 2018, The Author(s).",Belief bias; Deductive reasoning; Hierarchical Bayesian; Meta-analysis; Signal detection theory; Syllogisms,Bayes theorem; human; logic; meta analysis; receiver operating characteristic; thinking; Bayes Theorem; Humans; Logic; ROC Curve; Thinking,,Springer New York LLC,10699384,,,29943172,English,Psychonom.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of several abiotic and biotic drivers of early tree seedling recruitment across an alpine treeline ecotone. In two consecutive years, we sowed seeds of low- and high-elevation provenances of Larix decidua (European larch) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) below, at, and above the current treeline into intact vegetation and into open microsites with artificially removed surface vegetation, as well as into plots protected from seed predators and herbivores. Seedling emergence and early establishment in treatment and in control plots were monitored over two years. Tree seedling emergence occurred at and several hundred metres above the current treeline when viable seeds and suitable microsites for germination were available. However, dense vegetation cover at lower elevations and winter mortality at higher elevations particularly limited early recruitment. Post-dispersal predation, species, and provenance also affected emergence and early establishment. This study demonstrates the importance of understanding multiple abiotic and biotic drivers of early seedling recruitment that should be incorporated into predictions of treeline dynamics under climate change. © 2018 The Author(s).",,article; case report; climate change; clinical article; decidua; driver; ecotone; germination; granivore; human; Larix; mortality; nonhuman; Norway spruce; predation; prediction; seedling emergence; vegetation; winter,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,,English,Sci.

An example of such a topographical substrate is periodic gratings, where the dimensions of the periodic gratings influence cell morphology and directs cell differentiation. We first develop a novel sample preparation technique using Spurr's resin to allow for cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy imaging of cells on grating grooves, and observed that the plasma membrane on the basal surface of these cells can deform and bend into grooves between the gratings. We postulate that such membrane bending is an important first step in eliciting downstream effects. Thus, we use a combination of image analysis and mathematical modeling to explain the extent of bending of basal membrane into grooves. We show that the extent to which the basal membrane bends into grooves depends on both groove width and angle of the grating ridge. Our model predicts that the basal membrane will bend into grooves when they are wider than 1.9 ?m in width. The existence of such a threshold may provide an explanation for how the width of periodic gratings may bring about cellular downstream effects, such as cell proliferation or differentiation. © 2018 The Author(s).",,,,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,,English,Sci.

Pluripotent stem cells have great potential in the study for this late-onset disease, but acquirement of cells that are robust in quantity and quality is still technically demanding. Biophysical cues have been shown to direct stem cell fate, but the effect of different topographies in the lineage commitment and subsequent maturation stages of cells have been less examined. Using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we applied topographical patterns sequentially during differentiation stages and examined their ability to influence derivation yield and functionality of regionalized subtype-specific DA neurons. Gratings showed higher yield of DA neurons and may be beneficial for initial lineage commitment. Cells derived on pillars in the terminal differentiation stage have increased neuronal complexity, and were more capable of firing repetitive action potentials, showing that pillars yielded better network formation and functionality. Our topography platform can be applied to patient-derived iPSCs as well, and that cells harbouring LRRK2 mutation were more functionally mature when optimal topographies were applied sequentially.

While much of the efforts have traditionally been directed at geometrically frustrated antiferromagnets, recent studies reveal that systems featuring competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions are also promising candidate materials. We find that this competition leads to the notion of special temperatures, analogous to those of gases, at which the competing interactions balance, and the system is quasi-ideal. Although induced by weak perturbing interactions, these special temperatures are surprisingly high and constitute an accessible experimental diagnostic of eventual order or spin-liquid properties. The well characterised Hamiltonian and extended low-temperature susceptibility measurement of the canonical frustrated ferromagnet Dy2Ti2O7 enables us to formulate both a phenomenological and microscopic theory of special temperatures for magnets. Other members of this class of magnets include kapellasite Cu3Zn(OH)6Cl2 and the spinel GeCo2O4. © 2018 The Author(s).",,detection method; experimental study; liquid; physics; temperature; Article; chemical structure; gas; high temperature; low temperature; magnetism; molecular interaction; Monte Carlo method; physical phenomena; physics; thermodynamics,,Nature Publishing Group,20411723,,,29784922,English,Nat.

This warming deepened the soil active layer and triggered large mass losses from the watershed's glaciers, resulting in a ~10 times increase in delivery of glacial meltwaters, sediment, organic carbon and legacy contaminants to Lake Hazen, a >70% decrease in lake water residence time, and near certainty of summer ice-free conditions. Concomitantly, the community assemblage of diatom primary producers in the lake shifted dramatically with declining ice cover, from shoreline benthic to open-water planktonic species, and the physiological condition of the only fish species in the lake, Arctic Char, declined significantly. Collectively, these changes place Lake Hazen in a biogeochemical, limnological and ecological regime unprecedented within the past ~300 years. © 2018 The Author(s).",,lake water; organic carbon; active layer; community structure; data set; diatom; glacier mass balance; lake water; physiology; salmonid; temperature effect; warming; air temperature; Arctic; Article; climate change; deglaciation; diatom; fish; ice cover; lake; nonhuman; plankton; sediment; soil; summer; warming; water contamination; watershed; Canada; Lake Hazen; Nunavut; Bacillariophyta; Salvelinus alpinus,,Nature Publishing Group,20411723,,,29599477,English,Nat.

Owing to the lack of an overarching theory, however, a variety of model approximations exist to represent the subglacial drainage system. The Subglacial Hydrology Model Intercomparison Project (SHMIP) provides a set of synthetic experiments to compare existing and future models. We present the results from 13 participating models with a focus on effective pressure and discharge. For many applications (e.g. steady states and annual variations, low input scenarios) a simple model, such as an inefficient-system-only model, a flowline or lumped model, or a porous-layer model provides results comparable to those of more complex models. However, when studying short term (e.g. diurnal) variations of the water pressure, the use of a two-dimensional model incorporating physical representations of both efficient and inefficient drainage systems yields results that are significantly different from those of simpler models and should be preferentially applied. The results also emphasise the role of water storage in the response of water pressure to transient recharge. Finally, we find that the localisation of moulins has a limited impact except in regions of sparse moulin density. © The Author(s) 2018 This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",glacier hydrology; glacier modelling; glaciological model experiments; ice-sheet modelling; subglacial processes,glacial hydrology; hydrological modeling; ice mechanics; ice sheet; recharge; subglacial deposit; two-dimensional modeling; water storage,,Cambridge University Press,221430,,,,English,J.

While transfer function training sets are typically of local-to regional-scale in extent, combining those data to cover broad ecohydrological gradients, from the regional-to continental- and hemispheric-scales, is useful to assess if ecological optima of species vary geographically and therefore may have also varied over time. Continental-scale transfer functions can also maximise modern analogue quality without losing reconstructive skill, providing the opportunity to contextualise understanding of purely statistical outputs with greater insight into the biogeography of organisms. Here, we compiled, at moderate taxonomic resolution, a dataset of nearly 2000 modern surface peatland testate amoeba samples from 137 peatlands throughout North America. We developed transfer functions using four model types, tested them statistically and applied them to independent palaeoenvironmental data. By subdividing the dataset into eco-regions, we examined biogeographical patterns of hydrological optima and species distribution across North America. We combined our new dataset with data from Europe to create a combined transfer function. The performance of our North-American transfer function was equivalent to published models and reconstructions were comparable to those developed using regional training sets. The new model can therefore be used as an effective tool to reconstruct peatland palaeohydrology throughout the North American continent. Some eco-regions exhibited lower taxonomic diversity and some key indicator taxa had restricted ranges. However, these patterns occurred against a background of general cosmopolitanism, at the moderate taxonomic resolution used. Likely biogeographical patterns at higher taxonomic resolution therefore do not affect transfer function performance. Output from the combined North American and European model suggested that any geographical limit of scale beyond which further compilation of peatland testate amoeba data would not be valid has not yet been reached, therefore advocating the potential for a Holarctic synthesis of peatland testate amoeba data. Extending data synthesis to the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere would be more challenging due to higher regional endemism in those areas. © 2018 The Authors",Biogeography; Cosmopolitanism; Ecology; North America; Peatland; Testate amoebae; Transfer function; Water table,Ecology; Groundwater; Protozoa; Wetlands; Biogeography; Cosmopolitanism; North America; Peatland; Testate amoebae; Water tables; Transfer functions; biogeography; comparative study; ecohydrology; endemism; fossil assemblage; Holarctic Region; paleoenvironment; paleohydrology; peatland; protist; reconstruction; Southern Hemisphere; taxonomy; transfer function; water table; Europe; North America,,Elsevier Ltd,2773791,,QSRED,,English,Quat.

This dataset can be used to address theoretical questions about plant strategy and trade-offs, trait–environment relationships and environmental filtering, and trait variation across spatial scales, to validate satellite data, and to inform Earth system model parameters. Main types of variable contained: The database contains 91,970 measurements of 18 plant traits. The most frequently measured traits (> 1,000 observations each) include plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf fresh and dry mass, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus content, leaf C:N and N:P, seed mass, and stem specific density. Spatial location and grain: Measurements were collected in tundra habitats in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, including Arctic sites in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia and Siberia, alpine sites in the European Alps, Colorado Rockies, Caucasus, Ural Mountains, Pyrenees, Australian Alps, and Central Otago Mountains (New Zealand), and sub-Antarctic Marion Island. More than 99% of observations are georeferenced. Time period and grain: All data were collected between 1964 and 2018. A small number of sites have repeated trait measurements at two or more time periods. Major taxa and level of measurement: Trait measurements were made on 978 terrestrial vascular plant species growing in tundra habitats. Most observations are on individuals (86%), while the remainder represent plot or site means or maximums per species.

The Br-terminated Br-PEO-Br with the molecular weights of 20k and 100k were used as macroinitiators. ARGET ATRP was performed with ppm level amount CuBr2 as the catalyst and ascorbic acid as the reducing agent to overcome the sensitivity to oxygen in a traditional ATRP. The molecular weight of the PMMA block was manipulated by changing the molar ratio of monomers to the Br-PEO-Br macroinitiators. The synthesis of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA and its structure was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and 1H NMR, and the molecular weight of the PMMA block was determined by 1H NMR. Aqueous solutions of PMMA-b-PEO-b-PMMA were prepared by solvent-exchange, and their microstructures were examined by tensiometry, static light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. The effects of molecular weight of the PMMA and PEO blocks on the microstructure were elucidated.

The amyloid beta (A?) peptide has been implicated in the cause of AD, where the peptides undergo a conformational change and form neurotoxic amyloid oligomers which cause neuronal cell death. While AD has no cure, preventative measures are being designed to either slow down or stop the progression of this neurodegenerative disease. One of these measures involves dietary supplements with polyunsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). This omega-3 fatty acid is a key component of brain development and has been suggested to reduce the progression of cognitive decline. However, different studies have yielded different results as to whether DHA has positive, negative, or no effects on A? fibril formation. We believe that these discrepancies can be explained with varying concentrations of DHA. Here, we test the inhibitory effect of different concentrations of DHA on amyloid fibril formation using atomic force microscopy. Our results show that DHA has a strong inhibitory effect on A?1–42 fibril formation at lower concentrations (50% reduction in fibril length) than higher concentrations above its critical micelle concentration (70% increase in fibril length and three times the length of those at lower concentrations). We provide evidence that various concentrations of DHA can play a role in the inhibitory effects of amyloid fibril formation in vitro and help explain the discrepancies observed in previous studies. © 2018 by the authors.",Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid; Amyloid fibrils; Amyloid-beta A?; Atomic force microscopy; Docosahexaenoic acid; Omega-3; Polyunsaturated fatty acid,"amyloid; amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta-protein (1-42); docosahexaenoic acid; peptide fragment; protein aggregate; atomic force microscopy; chemistry; dose response; human; ultrastructure; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Peptide Fragments; Protein Aggregates",,MDPI AG,14203049,,MOLEF,30486385,English,Molecules,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057502810,

The main objective was to examine how beverage availability in school vending machines changes over three school years across schools in distinct school nutrition policy contexts. Secondary objectives were to examine how students' weekday SSB intake varies with time and identify longitudinal associations between beverage availability and SSB intake. Methods: This longitudinal study used data from the COMPASS study (2013/14-2015/16), representing 7679 students from 78 Canadian secondary schools and three provincial school nutrition policy contexts (Alberta - voluntary guidelines, Ontario public - mandatory guidelines, and Ontario private schools - no guidelines). We assessed availability of 10 beverage categories in schools' vending machines via the COMPASS School Environment Application and participants' intake of three SSB varieties (soft drinks, sweetened coffees/teas, and energy drinks) via a questionnaire. Hierarchical regression models were used to examine whether: i) progression of time and policy group were associated with beverage availability; and, ii) beverage availability was associated with students' SSB intake. Results: Ontario public schools were significantly less likely than the other policy groups to serve SSBs in their vending machines, with the exception of flavoured milks. Vending machine beverage availability was consistent over time. Participants' overall SSB intake remained relatively stable; reductions in soft drink intake were partially offset by increased sweetened coffee/tea consumption. Relative to Ontario public schools, attending school in Alberta was associated with more frequent energy drink intake and overall SSB intake whereas attending an Ontario private school was associated with less frequent soft drink intake, with no differences in overall SSB intake. Few beverage availability variables were significantly associated with participants' SSB intake. Conclusions: Mandatory provincial school nutrition policies were predictive of more limited SSB availability in school vending machines. SSB intake was significantly lower in Ontario public and private schools, although we did not detect a direct association between SSB consumption and availability. The findings provide support for mandatory school nutrition policies, as well as the need for comprehensive school- and broader population-level efforts to reduce SSB intake. © 2018 The Author(s).",Adolescents; Canada; Dietary assessment; Longitudinal study; School nutrition policy; Schools; Sugar-sweetened beverages; Vending machines,"adolescent; Alberta; article; Canadian; coffee; energy drink; female; high school; human; human experiment; longitudinal study; machine; major clinical study; male; milk; nutrition policy; nutritional assessment; Ontario; practice guideline; questionnaire; soft drink; student; sugar-sweetened beverage; tea; administration and dosage; Alberta; beverage; carbonated beverage; catering service; diet; evaluation study; feeding behavior; food handling; nutritional status; protocol compliance; school; sugar intake; carbohydrate; sweetening agent; Adolescent; Alberta; Beverages; Carbohydrates; Carbonated Beverages; Diet; Dietary Sugars; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food Dispensers, Automatic; Food Supply; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Nutrition Policy; Nutritional Status; Ontario; Schools; Students; Sugars; Sweetening Agents",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14795868,,,30482211,English,Int.

For urban populations, access to nutritionally inadequate poor-quality food has dire developmental consequences. The long-wave impacts of malnutrition at gestational and early childhood stages are negative and can be non-reversible. Moreover, those who survive into adulthood may face a lifetime of sub-optimal physical and mental development that undermines the second and third UN Sustainable Development Goals-to end hunger and to ensure healthy lives. This paper assesses the long-term health vulnerability of children with limited access to adequate and nutritious food in rapidly urbanizing cities. The analysis focuses on the African Urban Food Security Network (AFSUN) data drawn from 6453 household surveys in 11 cities and nine countries in Southern Africa. The results indicate that children in these households are consuming a limited diversity of food, have limited access to resources and have greater odds of experiencing both short-term and long-term food and nutrition insecurity. These findings demonstrate an underlying vulnerability to long-term health impacts stemming from nutritionally inadequate diets, with potentially significant costs to human capital. © 2018 by the authors.",Children; Food deserts; Food security; Malnutrition; Southern Africa; Urbanization,accessibility; child health; food availability; food quality; food security; household survey; malnutrition; nutrition; sustainable development; United Nations; urban area; urban population; urbanization; vulnerability; Southern Africa,,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057218549,

Despite its importance in the real-world, touch is often ignored in virtual environments. However, accurately simulating the sense of touch is difficult, requiring the use of high-fidelity haptic devices that are cost-prohibitive. Lower fidelity consumer-level haptic devices are becoming more widespread, yet are generally limited in perceived fidelity and the range of motion (degrees of freedom) required to realistically simulate many tasks. Studies into sound and vision suggest that the presence or absence of sound can influence task performance. Here, we explore whether the presence or absence of contextually relevant sound cues influences the performance of a simple haptic drilling task. Although the results of this study do not show any statistically significant difference in task performance with general (task-irrelevant) sound, we discuss how this is a necessary step in understanding the role of sound on haptic perception. © 2018 by the authors.",Haptics; Multimodal interactions; Sound; Task performance; Virtual environment; Virtual simulation,,,MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,22279709,,,,English,Informatics,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061230022,

However, this model does not simulate physiologically relevant tear volume and natural tear flow, air exposure, and mechanical rubbing. These factors can significantly impact release kinetics. We have developed an in vitro eye model (OcuFlow) that simulates these parameters. The aim of the study was to measure the release of PEG (polyethylene glycol), and HPMC (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) from a daily disposable hydrogel contact lens material (nelfilcon A; Dailies AquaComfort PLUS; DACP;) over 24 hrs using the OcuFlow platform. The elution of PEG and HPMC from DACP lenses was analyzed using LCMS (liquid chromatography mass spectrometry). The release of all wetting agents from the lenses followed a burst release pattern, which occurred within the first 1.5 hrs (P < 0.05). The release of PEG was greater than that of HPMC (P < 0.05). The amount of PEG and HPMC released at any given time was less than 1% of the amount in the blister pack solution. Our results suggest that HPMC and PEG are rapidly released from the CL. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

An aligned pattern cluster (APC) can reflect the conserved functionality. Discovering aligned residue associations (ARAs) in APCs can reveal subtle inner working characteristics of conserved regions of protein families. However, ARAs corresponding to different functionalities/subgroups/classes could be entangled because of subtle multiple entwined factors. METHODS: To discover and disentangle patterns from mixed-mode datasets, such as APCs when the residues are replaced by their fundamental biochemical properties list, this paper presents a novel method, Extended Aligned Residual Association Discovery and Disentanglement (E-ARADD). E-ARADD discretizes the numerical dataset to transform the mixed-mode dataset into an event-value dataset, constructs an ARA Frequency Matrix and then converts it into an adjusted Statistical Residual (SR) Vector Space (SRV) capturing statistical deviation from randomness. By applying Principal Component (PC) Decomposition on SRV, PCs ranked by their variance are obtained. Finally, the disentangled ARAs are discovered when the projections on a PC is re-projected to a vector space with the same basis vectors of SRV. RESULTS: Experiments on synthetic, cytochrome c and class A scavenger data have shown that E-ARADD can a) disentangle the entwined ARAs in APCs (with residues or biochemical properties), b) reveal subtle AR clusters relating to classes, subtle subgroups or specific functionalities. CONCLUSIONS: E-ARADD can discover and disentangle ARs and ARAs entangled in functionality and location of protein families to reveal functional subgroups and subgroup characteristics of biological conserved regions. Experimental results on synthetic data provides the proof-of-concept validation on the successful disentanglement that reveals class-associated ARAs with or without class labels as input. Experiments on cytochrome c data proved the efficacy of E-ARADD in handing both types of residue data. Our novel methodology is not only able to discover and disentangle ARs and ARAs in specific statistical/functional (PCs and RSRVs) spaces, but also their locations in the protein family functional domains. The success of E-ARADD shows its great potential to proteomic research, drug discovery and precision and personalized genetic medicine.",Aligned pattern clusters; Aligned residue associations; Disentanglement; Pattern discovery; Subgroup characteristics,,,NLM (Medline),17558794,,,30453949,English,BMC Med Genomics,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056715362,

However, Y values are rarely measured under the low energy delivery conditions that often prevail in the subsurface, and existing predictive methods for calculating Y values when the catabolic energy supply rate is limited remain poorly tested. Here, we derive and validate a new semi-theoretical method for calculating Y values: the Gibbs Energy Dynamic Yield Method (GEDYM). Method validation relies on a compilation of 132 geochemically relevant literature Y values comprising predominantly (60%) low energy (&lt; ?25 kJ (mol e?)?1) metabolisms. GEDYM is based on estimating the Gibbs energy change of the metabolic reaction (?Gmet), which links the Gibbs energy changes of the catabolic (?Gcat) and anabolic (?Gan) reactions of a microorganism through its growth yield. Given that the values of ?Gmet,?Gcat and ?Gan all depend on their respective reaction quotients, the resulting Y values account for changes in the chemical environment surrounding the cells. GEDYM incorporates an empirical relationship that accurately estimates the extent to which ?Gmet deviates from its standard state value from the relative difference between ?Gcat and its corresponding standard state value. GEDYM yields Y values with lower relative errors and statistical bias than the existing Gibbs energy dissipation method (GEDM). Using dissimilatory iron reduction, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis as examples, we illustrate the importance of considering variations in ?Gcat and ?Gan when predicting Y values for individual metabolisms. Because of its ability to dynamically adjust the values of ?Gmet and Y to variable geochemical conditions, GEDYM yields a more realistic representation of geomicrobial activity in predictive reactive transport models. © 2018 The Author(s)",,biogeochemistry; catabolism; geomicrobiology; Gibbs free energy; growth response; laboratory method; microbial activity; prediction; reactive transport; thermodynamics,,Elsevier Ltd,167037,,,,English,Geochim.

We examine how characteristics of adult tobacco users in the U.S. relate to transitions in tobacco product use. Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study data were analyzed from 12,862 adult current tobacco users who participated in Wave 1 (W1, 2013–2014) and Wave 2 (W2, 2014–2015). Three types of transitions were examined—(1) adding tobacco product(s); (2) switching to non-cigarette tobacco product(s); and (3) discontinuing all tobacco use—among those currently using: (1) any tobacco product; (2) cigarettes only (i.e., exclusive cigarette); and (3) cigarettes plus another tobacco product(s) (i.e., poly-cigarette). Multinomial logistic regression analyses determined relative risk of type of transition versus no transition as a function of demographic and tobacco use characteristics. Transitions in tobacco product use among adult tobacco users were common overall, but varied among different demographic groups, including by age, sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and poverty level. Further, cigarette smokers with higher dependence scores were more likely to add product(s) and less likely to discontinue tobacco use compared to those with low dependence scores. That high nicotine dependence is a barrier to discontinuing tobacco use adds evidence to support policy to lower nicotine content of cigarettes and to evaluate new products for their potential to reduce cigarette use. © 2018, MDPI AG.

To gain fundamental insights into the mechanism of their toxicity, the interactions of phosphocholine (PC) liposomes as model membranes were studied with three types of PFCs, including perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctane sulfonate, and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid potassium salt, together with three common surfactants: sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and sodium 1-heptanesulfonate (SHS). The interactions were systematically characterized by zeta potential measurement, dynamic light scattering, negative-stain transmission electron microscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Unmodified liposomes, calcein-loaded liposomes, and Laurdan dye-embedded liposomes were all tested. By gradually increasing the temperature, the three PFCs and SHS decreased the leakage of calcein-loaded 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine liposomes, whereas SDS and CTAB increased the leakage. The PFCs that affected the lipid membranes stronger than SHS were attributable to their perfluoroalkyl carbon chains. Packing of the lipids was further studied using Laurdan dye as a probe. Calcein leakage tests also indicated that PFCs inhibited lipid membrane leakage induced by inorganic nanoparticles such as silica and gold nanoparticles. This study confirmed the similar effect of the PFCs as cholesterol in affecting membrane properties and would be helpful for understanding the interaction mechanism of PFCs and cell membranes. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,,,American Chemical Society,24701343,,,,English,ACS Omega,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056572371,

CHOICE (which stands for Connecting, Honouring dignity, Offering support, supporting Identity, Creating opportunities, and Enjoyment) is a multi-component intervention to improve relationship-centred care (RCC) and overall mealtime experience for residents. The objective of this developmental evaluation was to determine: a) if the dining experience (e.g. physical, social and RCC practices) could be modified with the CHOICE Program, and b) how program components needed to be adapted and/or if new components were required. Methods: A mixed methods study conducted between April-November 2016 included two home areas (64 residents; 25 care staff/home management) within a single LTC home in Ontario. Mealtime Scan (MTS), which measures mealtime experience at the level of the dining room, was used to evaluate the effectiveness of CHOICE implementation at four time points. Change in physical, social, RCC dining environment ratings and overall quality of the mealtime experience over time was determined with linear mixed-effects analyses (i.e., repeated measures). Semi-structured interviews (n = 9) were conducted with home staff to identify what components of the intervention worked well and what improvements could be made. Results: Physical and overall mealtime environment ratings showed improvement over time in both areas; one home area also improved social ratings (p < 0.05). Interviews revealed in-depth insights into the program and implementation process: i) Knowing the context and culture to meet staff and resident needs; ii) Getting everyone on board, including management; iii) Keeping communication lines open throughout the process; iv) Sharing responsibility and accountability for mealtime goals and challenges; v) Empowering and supporting staff's creative mealtime initiatives. Conclusions: This developmental evaluation demonstrated the potential value of CHOICE. Findings suggest a need to: extend the time to tailor program components; empower home staff in change management; and provide increased coaching. © 2018 The Author(s).",Complex intervention implementation; Dining; Evaluation; Implementation science; Long-term care; Mealtimes; Personal support workers; Program development; Relationship-centred care; Residential care,adult; article; change management; clinical article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; female; human; long term care; male; Ontario; program development; resident; residential care; responsibility; semi structured interview; social interaction; staff; worker,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712318,,,30424725,English,BMC Geriatr.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056552489,

Its cleavage activity selectively requires Ag+ ions, and thus it has been used as a sensor for Ag+ detection. However, the previous selection yielded very limited information regarding its sequence requirement, since only ?0.1% of the population in the final library were related to Ag10c and most other sequences were inactive. In this work, we performed a reselection by randomizing the 19 important nucleotides in Ag10c in such a way that a purine has an equal chance of being A or G, whereas a pyrimidine has an equal chance of being T or C. The round 3 library of the reselection was carefully analyzed and a statistic understanding of the relative importance of each nucleotide was obtained. At the same time, a more active mutant was identified, containing two mutated nucleotides. Further analysis indicated new base pairs leading to an enzyme with smaller catalytic loops but with ?200% activity of the original Ag10c, and also excellent selectivity for Ag+. Therefore, a more active mutant of Ag10c was obtained and further truncations were successfully performed, which might be better candidates for developing new biosensors for silver. A deeper biochemical understanding was also obtained using this reselection method. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,,,American Chemical Society,24701343,,,,English,ACS Omega,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056434802,

We describe overall change in prevalence of tobacco product use and within-person transitions in tobacco product use in the U.S. between 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 for young adults (18–24 years) and older adults (25+ years). Data from Wave 1 (W1, 2013–2014) and Wave 2 (W2, 2014–2015) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study were analyzed (N = 34,235). Tobacco product types were categorized into: (1) combustible (cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah), (2) noncombustible (smokeless tobacco, snus pouches, dissolvable tobacco), and (3) electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Transitions for individual combustible-product types, and for single-and multiple-product use, were also considered. Overall prevalence of current tobacco use decreased from 27.6% to 26.3%. Among W1 non-tobacco users, 88.7% of young adults and 95.8% of older adults were non-tobacco users at W2. Among W1 tobacco users, 71.7% of young adults transitioned, with 20.7% discontinuing use completely, and 45.9% of older adults transitioned, with 12.5% discontinuing use completely. Continuing with/transitioning toward combustible product(s), particularly cigarettes, was more common than continuing with/transitioning toward ENDS. Tobacco use behaviors were less stable among young adults than older adults, likely reflecting greater product experimentation among young adults. Relative stability of cigarette use compared to other tobacco products (except older adult noncombustible use) demonstrates high abuse liability for cigarettes. © 2018 by the authors.

This study aimed to identify the differences of health states of rural residents in a lower middle income setting in China and its associated factors. Methods: A descriptive study of a stratified random sample of 3870 individuals was conducted in rural Anhui during 2015. We investigated the influence of five independent variables: individual demographic characteristics, family factors, social capital traits, physical health conditions and healthy lifestyle habits of participants who self-related their health as good. A chi-square test and ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to identify the relationship of these variables and self-rated health. Results: The study found that respondents who negatively rated their health often were female, elderly, poor, lived alone, had low levels of education, inadequate social support, poor physical health, used healthcare services and lived in the lower economic regions. We found no significant correlations between self-rated health and employment, marital status, medical insurance, or exercise frequency. Surprisingly, smoking and drinking also seemed to be unrelated to poor self-reported health. Conclusion: Health differences based on region were apparent in rural China. We highlighted the possible impacts of income, age, physical health, education, advanced age, and social support on health.

Unlike the existing techniques, in this paper, we propose a very lightweight single-time user identification technique that can ensure a unique authentication by presenting a system near-to-impossible to breach for intruders. Here, we have conducted a thorough study over single-time usage data collected from 33 users. The study reveals several new findings, which in turn, leads us to a novel solution exploiting a new machine learning technique. Our evaluation confirms that the proposed solution operates with only 5% False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and only 6% False Rejection Rate (FRR) over the data collected from 33 users. We further evaluate the performance through comparing its performance with some existing machine learning techniques. Finally, we perform a real implementation of our proposed solution as a mobile application to conduct a rigorous user evaluation over 27 participants using three different devices in order to show how the solution works in practical situations. Outcomes of the user evaluation demonstrate as low as 0% FAR after letting intruders to mimic the actual user, which ensures extremely low probability of being breached. Moreover, we let 2 users to continuously use our application over 25 days in different states during their operation. Outcomes of this evaluation demonstrate as low as 1% FRR confirming the usability of our technique in long-term usage. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Behavioral biometrics; Mean-SD clustering; Security; Smartphone,Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Ubiquitous computing; Behavioral biometrics; False acceptance rate; False rejection rate; Machine learning techniques; Mean-SD clustering; Security; Sensitive informations; Smart mobile devices; Mobile security,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Part of this disconnect is attributed to the exclusion of knowledge users at the outset of a study, which often results in the generation of knowledge that is not usable at the point of care. Integrated knowledge translation blended with qualitative methodologies has the potential to address this issue by working alongside knowledge users throughout the research process. Nevertheless, there is currently a paucity of literature about how integrated knowledge translation can be integrated into qualitative methodology; herein, we begin to address this gap in methodology discourse. The purpose of this paper is to describe our experience of conducting a focused ethnography with a collaborative integrated knowledge translation approach, including the synergies and potential sources of discord between integrated knowledge translation and focused ethnography. Methods: We describe the specific characteristics and synergies that exist when using an integrated knowledge translation approach with focused ethnography, using a research exemplar about the experiences of frail, older adults undergoing a transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Results: Embedding integrated knowledge translation within focused ethnography resulted in (1) an increased focus on the culture and values of the context under study, (2) a higher level of engagement among researchers, study participants and knowledge users, and (3) a commitment to partnership between researchers and knowledge users as part of a larger programme of research, resulting in a (4) greater emphasis on the importance of reciprocity and trustworthiness in the research process. Conclusions: Engaging in integrated knowledge translation from the outset of a study ensures that research findings are relevant for application at the point of care. The integration of integrated knowledge translation within focused ethnography allows for real-time uptake of meaningful and emerging findings, the strengthening of collaborative research teams, and opportunities for sustained programmes of research and relationships in the field of health services research. Further exploration of the integration of knowledge translation approaches with qualitative methodologies is recommended. © 2018 The Author(s).",focused ethnography; health services; integrated knowledge translation; knowledge user; patient experience; qualitative methodology; transcatheter aortic valve implantation,"aged; article; embedding; ethnography; health science; health services research; human; public health; scientist; transcatheter aortic valve implantation; caregiver; cooperation; cultural anthropology; family; health care delivery; health service; health services research; knowledge; methodology; patient participation; stakeholder engagement; translational research; Aged; Anthropology, Cultural; Caregivers; Cooperative Behavior; Delivery of Health Care; Family; Health Services; Health Services Research; Humans; Knowledge; Patient Participation; Research Design; Stakeholder Participation; Translational Medical Research",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14784505,,,30390696,English,Health Res.

Adults from Canada, the US, Australia, and the UK completed an online survey (n = 11,617). Respondents were randomized to view cereal boxes displaying one of 11 FOP label conditions for ‘high’ levels of sugar and saturated fat: control (no FOP symbol), red circle, red ‘stop sign’, magnifying glass, magnifying glass + exclamation mark, and ‘caution’ triangle + exclamation mark, plus each of these five conditions accompanied by a ‘high in’ text descriptor. Participants identified the amount of saturated fat and sugar in the product (‘low’/’moderate’/’high’). Participants were more likely to correctly identify the product as ‘high’ in saturated fat or sugar when shown the stop sign, triangle + exclamation mark, red circle, or magnifying glass + exclamation mark symbols incorporating ‘high in’ text (p < 0.01). The magnifying glass was the least effective symbol. The stop sign (37.7%) and triangle + exclamation mark (22.0%) were most frequently selected as the best symbol for indicating high nutrient amounts. Overall, FOP labels with ‘high in’ descriptions, red color and intuitive ‘warning’ symbols (e.g., stop signs, exclamation marks, ‘caution’ triangles) were more effective at communicating high levels of nutrients of public health concern in a time-limited environment. © 2018 by the authors.

This paper presents the design, integration, and testing of a simple, self-contained, low-power, non-invasive system at low cost applicable for such purpose. The system is powered by piezoelectric energy harvesters (EHs) based on PZT and includes a microcontroller unit (MCU) and a central hub. Real-time information regarding the electricity consumption is measured and communicated by the system, which ultimately offers a dependable and promising solution as a wireless sensor node. The dynamic power management ensures the system to work with different types of PZT EHs at a wide range of input power. Thus, the system is robust against fluctuation of the current in the electricity grid and requires minimum adjustment if EH unit requires exchange or upgrade. Experimental results demonstrate that this unit is in a position to read and transmit 60 Hz alternating current (AC) sensor signals with a high accuracy no less than 91.4%. The system is able to achieve an operation duty cycle from <1 min up to 18 min when the current in an electric wire varies from 7.6 A to 30 A, depending on the characteristics of different EHs and intensity of current being monitored. © 2018 by the authors.

In particular, the classification of infections among the subtypes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a routine component of clinical management, and there are now many classification algorithms available for this purpose. Although several of these algorithms are similar in accuracy and speed, the majority are proprietary and require laboratories to transmit HIV-1 sequence data over the network to remote servers. This potentially exposes sensitive patient data to unauthorized access, and makes it impossible to determine how classifications are made and to maintain the data provenance of clinical bioinformatic workflows. We propose an open-source supervised and alignment-free subtyping method (KAMERIS) that operates on k-mer frequencies in HIV-1 sequences. We performed a detailed study of the accuracy and performance of subtype classification in comparison to four state-of-the-art programs. Based on our testing data set of manually curated real-world HIV-1 sequences (n = 2, 784), KAMERIS obtained an overall accuracy of 97%, which matches or exceeds all other tested software, with a processing rate of over 1, 500 sequences per second. Furthermore, our fully standalone general-purpose software provides key advantages in terms of data security and privacy, transparency and reproducibility. Finally, we show that our method is readily adaptable to subtype classification of other viruses including dengue, influenza A, and hepatitis B and C virus. © 2018 Solis-Reyes et al.

Many researchers have postulated that human motor control can be mathematically represented using optimal control theories, whereby some cost function is effectively maximized or minimized. However, such abilities are compromised in stroke patients. In this study, to promote rehabilitation of the stroke patient, a rehabilitation robot has been developed using optimal control theory. Despite numerous studies of control strategies for rehabilitation, there is a limited number of rehabilitation robots using optimal control theory. The main idea of this work is to show that impedance control gains cannot be kept constant for optimal performance of the robot using a feedback linearization approach. Hence, a general method for the real-time and optimal impedance control of an end-effector-based rehabilitation robot is proposed. The controller is developed for a 2 degree-of-freedom upper extremity stroke rehabilitation robot, and compared to a feedback linearization approach that uses the standard optimal impedance derived from covariance propagation equations. The new method will assign optimal impedance gains at each configuration of the robot while performing a rehabilitation task. The proposed controller is a linear quadratic regulator mapped from the operational space to the joint space. Parameters of the two controllers have been tuned using a unified biomechatronic model of the human and robot. The performances of the controllers were compared while operating the robot under four conditions of human movements (impaired, healthy, delayed, and time-advanced) along a reference trajectory, both in simulations and experiments. Despite the idealized and approximate nature of the human-robot model, the proposed controller worked well in experiments. Simulation and experimental results with the two controllers showed that, compared to the standard optimal controller, the rehabilitation system with the proposed optimal controller is assisting more in the active-assist therapy while resisting in active-constrained case. Furthermore, in passive therapy, the proposed optimal controller maintains the position error and interaction forces in safer regions. This is the result of updating the impedance in the operational space using a linear time-variant impedance model. © 2018 Ghannadi, Sharif Razavian and McPhee.",Human robot interaction; Linear quadratic regulator; Operational space; Optimal impedance control; Rehabilitation manipulandum; Stroke rehabilitation,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,22969144,,,,English,Front.

Accounting for the vast interindividual variability in cybersickness forms a pivotal step in solving the issue. Most studies of cybersickness focus on a single factor (e.g., balance, sex, or vection), while other contributors are overlooked. Here, we characterize the complex relationship between cybersickness and several measures of sensorimotor processing. In a single session, we conducted a battery of tests of balance control, vection responses, and vestibular sensitivity to self-motion. Following this, we measured cybersickness after VR exposure. We constructed a principal components regression model using the measures of sensorimotor processing. The model significantly predicted 37% of the variability in cybersickness measures, with 16% of this variance being accounted for by a principal component that represented balance control measures. The strongest predictor was participants’ sway path length during vection, which was inversely related to cybersickness [r(28) =-0.53, P = 0.002] and uniquely accounted for 7.5% of the variance in cybersickness scores across participants. Vection strength reports and measures of vestibular sensitivity were not significant predictors of cybersickness. We discuss the possible role of sensory reweighting in cybersickness that is suggested by these results, and we identify other factors that may account for the remaining variance in cybersickness. The results reiterate that the relationship between balance control and cybersickness is anything but straightforward. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The advent of consumer virtual reality provides a pressing need for interventions that combat sickness in simulated environments (cybersickness). This research builds on multiple theories of cybersickness etiology to develop a predictive model that distinguishes between individuals who are/are not likely to experience cybersickness. In the future this approach can be adapted to provide virtual reality users with curated content recommendations based on more efficient measurements of sensorimotor processing. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

This problem relates to the inherent maximal error-detecting capability of the language in question. We present two efficient algorithms for solving this problem, both of which execute in time O(r2n2d), where r is the cardinality of the alphabet involved, n is the number of transitions in the given NFA, and d is the computed edit distance. We have implemented one of the two algorithms and present here a set of performance tests. The correctness of the algorithms is based on the connection between word distances and error detection and the fact that nondeterministic transducers can be used to represent the errors (resp., edit operations) involved in error-detection (resp., in word distances). © 2018 by the authors.",Algorithms; Automata; Complexity; Edit distance; Implementation; Regular language; Transducers,Algorithms; Finite automata; Formal languages; Pipeline processing systems; Problem solving; Transducers; Automata; Complexity; Data-communication; Edit distance; Implementation; Nondeterministic finite automaton; Performance tests; Synchronization error; Error detection,,MDPI AG,19994893,,,,English,Algorithms,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056848528,

The qubit is described by an Unruh-DeWitt detector model coupled quadratically to a scalar field and alternately to a fermion field. In the cycle, the qubit undergoes two stages of differing constant acceleration corresponding to thermal contact with a hot and cold reservoir. Explicit conditions are derived on the accelerations required for this cycle to have positive work output. By analytically calculating the detector response functions, we show that the dimensionality of the quadratic and fermionic coupling constants introduces qualitatively different behaviour of the work output from this cycle as compared to the case in which the qubit linearly couples to a scalar field. © 2018, The Author(s).",Black Holes; Thermal Field Theory,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

The Laurentian Great Lakes are the world's largest supply of freshwater and their ice cover has a major impact on regional weather and climate, ship navigation, and public safety. Ice experts at the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) have been manually producing operational Great Lakes image analysis charts based on visual interpretation of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In that regard, we have investigated the performance of the semi-automated segmentation algorithm ""glocal"" Iterative Region Growing with Semantics (IRGS) for lake ice classification using dual polarized RADARSAT-2 imagery acquired over Lake Erie. Analysis of various case studies indicated that the ""glocal"" IRGS algorithm could provide a reliable ice-water classification using dual polarized images with a high overall accuracy of 90.4%. However, lake ice types that are based on stage of development were not effectively identified due to the ambiguous relation between backscatter and ice types. The slight improvement of using dual-pol as opposed to single-pol images for ice-water discrimination was also demonstrated. © 2018 by the authors.",Classification; Lake ice; RADARSAT-2; Synthetic aperture radar,Automation; Classification (of information); Image analysis; Image classification; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Lakes; Semantics; Synthetic aperture radar; Analysis of various; Canadian Ice Services; High-latitude regions; Laurentian Great Lakes; Radarsat-2; Semi-automated segmentation; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Visual interpretation; Ice,,MDPI AG,20724292,,,,English,Remote Sens.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057086302,

Starting from what Svein Jentoft has had to say about the topic, we explore the idea that viable fishing communities require viable fish stocks, and viable fish stocks require viable fishing communities. To elaborate and expand on Jentoft’s arguments, first, we discuss values as a key attribute of communities that confer the ability to manage coastal resources. Turning to power, next we explore why fishing communities need to be empowered by having the opportunity to self-manage or co-manage resources. Third, regarding community viability, we make the argument that (1) rebuilding or maintaining viable fishing communities and fish stocks cannot succeed without first dealing with vulnerabilities, and that (2) the dimensions of vulnerability involve increase/decrease in well-being, better/poorer access to capitals, and building/losing resilience. The idea that healthy fishing communities and healthy fish stocks require one another implies a viable system that contains both, a social-ecological system view. The values embedded in communities enable them to manage resources. Thus, managers and policy makers need to imagine healthy fishing communities who take care of resources, and this positive image of communities is more likely than present policies to lead to viable fishing communities as well as viable fish stocks. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Community; Images; Power; Resilience; Small-scale fisheries; Social-ecological systems; Values; Vulnerability,ecosystem resilience; fishery management; fishing community; marine resource; resource management; small scale industry; valuation; vulnerability,,Springer Verlag,18727859,,,,English,Marit.

NetF, related to the ?-sheet pore-forming Leukocidin/Hemolysin superfamily, is considered a major virulence factor for this disease. The main purpose of this work is to demonstrate the pore-forming activity of NetF and characterize the chemical nature of its binding site. Electron microscopy using recombinant NetF (rNetF) confirmed that NetF is able to oligomerize and form large pores in equine ovarian (EO) cell membranes and sheep red blood cells. These oligomeric pores appear to be about 4-6 nm in diameter, and the number of oligomer subunits to vary from 6 to 9. Sodium periodate treatment rendered EO cells non-susceptible to NetF, suggesting that NetF binding requires cell surface carbohydrates. NetF cytotoxicity was also inhibited by a lectin that binds sialic acid, by sialidase, and by free sialic acid in excess, all of which clearly implicate sialic acid-containing membrane carbohydrates in NetF binding and/or toxicity for EO cells. Binding of NetF to sheep red blood cells was not inhibited by the gangliosides GM1, GM2 and GM3, nor did the latter promote membrane permeabilization in liposomes, suggesting that they do not constitute the cellular receptors. In contrast, treatment of EO cells with different proteases reduced their susceptibility to NetF, suggesting that the NetF receptor is a sialic acid-containing glycoprotein. © 2018 Mehdizadeh Gohari et al.

We investigate this transition for a general spherically-symmetric metric outside the shell and find that it occurs generically. Once the shell is null its persistence on a null trajectory can be ensured by several mechanisms that we describe. Using the outgoing Vaidya metric as an example we show that if a dust shell acquires surface pressure on its transition to a null trajectory it can evade the Schwarzschild radius through its collapse. Alternatively, the pressureless collapse may continue if the exterior geometry acquires a more general form. © 2018 The Author(s)",,,,Elsevier B.V.,5503213,,NUPBB,,English,Nucl. Phys.

Suppression in amblyopia may be an unequal form of normal interocular suppression or a distinct pathophysiology. To explore this issue, we examined the orientation tuning and contrast dependence of continuous flash suppression (CFS) in adults with amblyopia and visually normal controls. METHODS. Nine patients (mean age, 26.9 ± SD 4.7 years) and 11 controls (mean age, 24.8 ± SD 5.3 years) participated. In the CFS paradigm, spatially one-dimensional noise refreshing at 10 Hz was displayed in one eye to induce suppression of the other eye, and suppression strength was measured by using a grating contrast increment detection task. In experiment 1, noise contrast was fixed and the orientation difference between the noise and the grating was varied. In experiment 2, noise and grating orientations were identical and noise contrast was varied. RESULTS. Suppression patterns varied in both groups. In experiment 1, controls showed consistently orientation-tuned CFS (mean half-height bandwidth, 35.88 ± SD 21.58) with near-equal strength between eyes. Five of nine patients with amblyopia exhibited orientation-independent CFS. Eight patients had markedly unequal suppression between eyes. Experiment 2 found that increasing the noise contrast to the amblyopic eye may produce suppression of the fellow eye, but suppression remained unequal between eyes. CONCLUSIONS. Our data revealed that orientation specificity in CFS was very broad or absent in some patients with amblyopia, which could not be predicted by clinical measures. Suppression was unbalanced across the entire contrast range for most patients. This suggests that abnormal early visual experience disrupts the development of interocular suppression mechanisms. © 2018 The Authors.",Amblyopia; Continuous flash suppression; Interocular suppression; Psychophysics,"adult; amblyopia; analysis of variance; Article; binocular vision; blood patch; clinical article; contrast enhancement; controlled study; disease severity assessment; eye refraction; female; human; interocular transfer; male; middle aged; molecular pathology; performance; priority journal; psychophysics; refraction error; retinoscopy; spatiotemporal analysis; task performance; tuning curve; vision; visual acuity; visual orientation; young adult; amblyopia; contrast sensitivity; eye dominance; orientation; pathophysiology; perceptive threshold; photostimulation; physiology; strabismus; Adult; Amblyopia; Contrast Sensitivity; Dominance, Ocular; Female; Humans; Male; Orientation; Photic Stimulation; Sensory Thresholds; Strabismus; Vision, Binocular; Young Adult",,Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.,1460404,,IOVSD,30452600,English,Invest.

METHODS: In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, 15 primary care practices were randomly assigned to 1 of the following active-treatment conditions: OMSC or OMSC plus performance coaching (OMSC+). All practices received support to implement the OMSC. In addition, clinicians in the OMSC+ group participated in a 1.5-hour skills-based coaching session and received an individualized performance report. All clinicians and a cross-sectional sample of their patients were surveyed before and 4 months after introduction of the interventions. The primary outcome measure was rates of tobacco-dependence treatment strategy (Ask, Advise, Assist, Arrange) delivery. Secondary outcomes were patient quit attempts and smoking abstinence measured at 6 months' follow-up. RESULTS: Primary care clinicians (166) and patients (1,990) were enrolled in the trial. Clinicians in the OMSC+ group had statistically greater rates of delivery for Ask (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.69; 95% CI, 1.05-2.72), Assist (AOR = 1.64; 95% CI, 1.08-2.49), and Arrange (AOR = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.22-3.31). Sensitivity analysis found that the rate of delivery for Advise was greater only among those clinicians who attended the coaching session (AOR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.10-2.49; P = .02). No differences were documented between groups for cessation outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Performance coaching significantly increased rates of tobacco-dependence treatment by primary care clinicians when delivered as part of a multicomponent intervention. © 2018 Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.",audit and feedback; coaching; knowledge translation; Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation; primary care; quality improvement; randomized controlled trial; smoking cessation,,,NLM (Medline),15441717,,,30420364,English,Ann Fam Med,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056328826,

Objective This meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effect of HP intakes on kidney function in healthy adults. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials comparing HP (?1.5 g/kg body weight or ?20% energy intake or ?100 g protein/d) with normal- or lower-protein (NLP; ?5% less energy intake from protein/d compared with HP group) intakes on kidney function. Medline and EMBASE databases were searched. Randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of HP with NLP (>4 d duration) intakes on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in adults without kidney disease were included. Results A total of 2144 abstracts were reviewed, with 40 articles selected for full-text review; 28 of these were analyzed and included data from 1358 participants. Data were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis (RevMan 5; The Cochrane Collaboration), meta-regression (STATA; StataCorp), and dose-response analysis (Prism; GraphPad). Analyses were conducted using postintervention (post) GFR and the change in GFR from preintervention to post. The post-only comparison showed a trivial effect for GFR to be higher after HP intakes [standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.19; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.31; P = 0.002]. The change in GFR did not differ between interventions (SMD: 0.11; 95% CI: -0.05, 0.27; P = 0.16). There was a linear relation between protein intake and GFR in the post-only comparison (r = 0.332, P = 0.03), but not between protein intake and the change in GFR (r = 0.184, P = 0.33). The main limitation of the current analysis is the unclear risk of selection bias of the included trials. Conclusions Postintervention GFR comparisons indicate that HP diets result in higher GFRs; however, when changes in GFR were compared, dietary protein had no effect. Our analysis indicates that HP intakes do not adversely influence kidney function on GFR in healthy adults. © 2018 American Society for Nutrition.",chronic kidney disease; GFR; glomerular filtration rate; meta-analysis; protein; renal failure,"Article; body weight; caloric intake; carbohydrate intake; diet therapy; Embase; energy balance; fat intake; glomerulus filtration rate; health status; human; kidney function; Medline; protein diet; protein intake; systematic review; administration and dosage; adult; drug effect; meta analysis; protein intake; protein restriction; Adult; Diet, Protein-Restricted; Dietary Proteins; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans",,Oxford University Press,223166,,JONUA,30383278,English,J.

Three facilitators identified were: (i) Training, knowledge and ergonomists’ support; (ii) Communication, participation and support; and (iii) An effective implementation process. The barriers and facilitators identified were similar to those in general OHS processes.

However, these assessments often do not explore the potential health risks of climate change far outside the range of recent experience with extreme weather events and other climate-related hazards. Climate and health stress tests are designed to increase the capacity of health systems and related sectors to manage potentially disruptive climate-related shocks and stresses. Stress tests focus on hypothetical scenarios, during which it would be difficult for the health system to maintain its essential function of providing services to protect population health. The stress test explores approaches to effectively manage acute and chronic climate-related events and conditions that could directly impact health systems, and climate-related events in non-health sectors that can indirectly impact health outcomes and/or health system function. We provide detailed methods and guidance for conducting climate and health stress tests, centering on three primary activities: (1) preparing and scoping the stress test; (2) successfully conducting the stress test; and (3) communicating the results to key stakeholders to facilitate policy and programmatic reforms. © 2018 by the authors.

Objectives: The objectives for this study were to examine the prevalence of polypharmacy for people with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) following injury and to determine risk factors. Setting: Ontario, Canada Methods: We used provincial-level administrative health services data of publicly funded healthcare encounters housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario. We examined prescription medications dispensed over a 1 year period post injury for persons 66+ years with an index traumatic SCI between 2004 and 2014. Polypharmacy was defined as being on 10 or more drug classes. Descriptive and analytical statistics were conducted. Relative risks and 95% confidence limits for factors related to polypharmacy were calculated using a robust Poisson multivariate regression model. Results: We identified 418 cases of persons with traumatic SCI during the observation window. A total of 233 patients (56%) were taking at least 10 drug classes in the year following discharge from care for traumatic SCI. The mean number of drug classes taken post injury was 11 (SD = 6). Continuity of care was significantly associated with polypharmacy, with a higher continuity of care (having at least 75% of visits with the same doctor) reducing the risk of polypharmacy. The most common drugs prescribed were laxatives, opioids and cardiovascular-related drugs. Conclusion: Findings suggest that polypharmacy is extensive among older adults with traumatic SCI.

The Global Matrix 3.0 of Report Card grades on physical activity was developed to achieve a better understanding of the global variation in child and youth physical activity and associated supports. Methods: Work groups from 49 countries followed harmonized procedures to develop their Report Cards by grading 10 common indicators using the best available data. The participating countries were divided into 3 categories using the United Nations' human development index (HDI) classification (low or medium, high, and very high HDI). Results: A total of 490 grades, including 369 letter grades and 121 incomplete grades, were assigned by the 49 work groups. Overall, an average grade of ""C-,"" ""D+,"" and ""C-"" was obtained for the low and medium HDI countries, high HDI countries, and very high HDI countries, respectively. Conclusions: The present study provides rich new evidence showing that the situation regarding the physical activity of children and youth is a concern worldwide. Strategic public investments to implement effective interventions to increase physical activity opportunities are needed. © 2018 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Active transportation; Global comparison; Health promotion; International; Sedentary behavior; Sport,"article; case report; child; clinical article; female; health promotion; human; human development; human experiment; investment; juvenile; male; physical activity; sport; United Nations; adolescent; clinical trial; exercise; health promotion; multicenter study; preschool child; procedures; psychology; research; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Exercise; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Research Report",,Human Kinetics Publishers Inc.,15433080,,,30475137,English,J.

These ZnO@MFCNC hybrid nanostructures were evaluated for their in vitro sun protection factor performance and photocatalytic activity under simulated UV and solar radiation. The photodegradation kinetics of a model pigment (methylene blue) was fitted to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. A 4-fold increase in the photocatalytic activity of ZnO@MFCNCs was observed when compared to pure ZnO. This is associated with (i) increased specific surface area provided by the MFCNC template, (ii) confined surface energy and controlled growth of ZnO nanoparticles, and (iii) entrapment of photoinduced charge carriers in the pores of the core-shell MFCNC rod, followed by fast promotion of interfacial e-charge transfer to the surface of the catalyst. The present study demonstrates how an increase in photocatalytic activity can be engineered without the introduction of structural defects or band gap tailoring of the semiconductor. The aqueous-based ZnO@MFCNC hybrid system displayed attractive UV-absorption and photocatalytic characteristics, offering the conversion of this renewable and sustainable technology into intelligent cosmetic formulations. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.",,,,American Chemical Society,24701343,,,,English,ACS Omega,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054299924,

We also define efficient protocols for controlling and manipulating the lattice characteristics. These protocols are applied in an experimental realization of a lattice of optical spin-orbit beams. The novel passive devices we demonstrate here are also a natural alternative to existing methods for producing single-axis OAM and spin-orbit beams. Our techniques provide new tools for investigations of chiral and topological materials with light and particle beams. © 2018 authors.

Our research proposes that goal regulation in the workplace may have consequences for creativity. While there is an increasing trend for organizations and workers to visualize the structure of their goals (e.g., management hierarchy, concept-map, flowchart), prior research suggests the visualization approaches differ as one of the three types: hierarchical, network, and sequential models. Because a network model (vs. hierarchical and sequential models) highlights multiple connections between goals and reveals unobvious connections between them, we hypothesized that the use of a network goal model might increase people's ability to integrate seemingly unrelated ideas, even on subsequent unrelated tasks, leading to higher (convergent) creative performance. To test the hypothesis, we conducted an experiment in 2017 manipulating participants' goal models (hierarchical, network, sequential; N = 191, median age = 19) and measured their creativity. Results suggest that those in the network model condition performed better in the kind of creativity task that requires meaningful integration of unrelated ideas (i.e., convergent creativity); in contrast, there was no difference between goal model conditions on divergent creative performance.

The effects of tonal and broadband acoustic excitation are considered since such acoustic emissions commonly result from airfoil self-noise and can influence flow development via a feedback loop. This interdependence is decoupled, and the problem is studied in a controlled manner through the use of an external acoustic source. The flow field is assessed using time-resolved, two-component particle image velocimetry, the results of which show that, for equivalent energy input levels, tonal and broadband excitation can produce equivalent changes in the mean separation bubble topology. These changes in topology result from the influence of excitation on transition and the subsequent development of coherent structures in the bubble. Both tonal and broadband excitation lead to earlier shear layer roll-up and thus reduce the bubble size and advance mean reattachment upstream, while the shed vortices tend to persist farther downstream of mean reattachment in the case of tonal excitation. Through a cross-examination of linear stability theory (LST) predictions and measured disturbance characteristics, nonlinear disturbance interactions are shown to play a crucial role in the transition process, leading to significantly different disturbance development for the tonal and broadband excited flows. Specifically, tonal excitation results in transition being dominated by the excited mode, which grows in strong accordance with linear theory and damps the growth of all other disturbances. On the other hand, disturbance amplitudes are more moderate for the natural and broadband excited flows, and so all unstable disturbances initially grow in accordance with LST. For all cases, a rapid redistribution of perturbation energy to a broad range of frequencies follows, with the phenomenon occurring earliest for the broadband excitation case. By taking nonlinear effects into consideration, important ramifications are made clear in regards to comparing LST predictions and experimental or numerical results, thus explaining the trends reported in recent investigations. These findings offer new insights into the influence of tonal and broadband noise emissions, resulting from airfoil self-noise or otherwise, on transition and flow development within a separation bubble. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.",aeroacoustics; boundary layer separation; transition to turbulence,Acoustic emission testing; Acoustic wave transmission; Aeroacoustics; Airfoils; Boundary layers; Topology; Turbulent flow; Velocity measurement; Boundary-layer separation; Broadband excitation; Disturbance amplitudes; Linear stability theory; Measured disturbances; Nonlinear disturbance; Transition to turbulence; Two-component particles; Acoustic noise; acoustic wave; aerodynamics; boundary layer; bubble; separation; transient flow; turbulent flow,,Cambridge University Press,221120,,JFLSA,,English,J.

The study examines the diffusion of RETs during the 2000-2016 period, identifies the systemic and transformational failures responsible for the functional performance of the TISs, and generates insights about factors that have the potential to sustain the development of RET projects. Findings suggest that the TIS-proposed causal mechanisms were present and performed as expected.

Allochthonous OC loads from the landscape, along with autochthonous OC loads from primary production, are mineralized in lakes, buried in lake sediments, and exported via surface or groundwater outflows. Although these processes provide a basis for a conceptual understanding of lake OC budgets, few studies have integrated these fluxes under a dynamic modeling framework to examine their interactions and relative magnitudes. We developed a simple, dynamic mass balance model for OC, and applied the model to a set of five lakes. We examined the relative magnitudes of OC fluxes and found that long-term (>10 year) lake OC dynamics were predominantly driven by allochthonous loads in four of the five lakes, underscoring the importance of terrestrially-derived OC in northern lake ecosystems. Our model highlighted seasonal patterns in lake OC budgets, with increasing water temperatures and lake productivity throughout the growing season corresponding to a transition from burial- to respiration-dominated OC fates. Ratios of respiration to burial, however, were also mediated by the source (autochthonous vs. allochthonous) of total OC loads. Autochthonous OC is more readily respired and may therefore proportionally reduce burial under a warming climate, but allochthonous OC may increase burial due to changes in precipitation. The ratios of autochthonous to allochthonous inputs and respiration to burial demonstrate the importance of dynamic models for examining both the seasonal and inter-annual roles of lakes in landscape and global carbon cycling, particularly in a global change context. Finally, we highlighted critical data needs, which include surface water DOC observations in paired tributary and lake systems, measurements of OC burial rates, groundwater input volume and DOC, and budgets of particulate OC. © 2018 The Authors",Carbon cycle; Dissolved organic carbon; GLEON; LTER; Mass balance; Particulate organic carbon,Budget control; Ecosystems; Groundwater; Organic carbon; Carbon cycles; Dissolved organic carbon; GLEON; LTER; Mass balance; Particulate organic carbon; Lakes; carbon cycle; conceptual framework; dissolved organic matter; global change; growing season; lacustrine environment; lake water; mass balance; particulate organic matter; seasonal variation; surface water,,Elsevier B.V.,3043800,,ECMOD,,English,Ecol.

Yet, there are few reports in the literature that describe how results are summarised, shared and used. This paper aims to inform knowledge translation (KT) for realist reviews by describing the process of developing a KT strategy for a review on pathways for scaling up complex public health interventions. Methods: The participatory approach used for the realist review was also used to develop the KT strategy. The approach included three main steps, namely (1) an international meeting focused on interpreting preliminary findings from the realist review and seeking input on KT activities; (2) a targeted literature review on KT for realist reviews; and (3) consultations with primary knowledge users of the review. Results: The international meeting identified a general preference among knowledge users for findings from the review that are action oriented. A need was also identified for understanding how to tailor findings for specific knowledge user groups in relation to their needs. The literature review identified four papers that included brief descriptions of planned or actual KT activities for specific research studies; however, information was minimal on what KT activities or products work for whom, under what conditions and why. The consultations revealed that KT for realist reviews should consider the following: (1) activities closely aligned with the preferences of specific knowledge user groups; (2) key findings that are sensitive to factors within the knowledge user's context; and (3) actionable statements that can advance KT goals, activities or products. The KT strategy derived from the three activities includes a planning framework and tailored KT activities that address preferences of knowledge users for findings that are action oriented and context relevant. Conclusions: This paper provides an example of a KT strategy for realist reviews that blends theoretical and practical insights. Evaluation of the strategy's implementation will provide useful insights on its effectiveness and potential for broader application. © 2018 The Author(s).",chronic disease prevention; complex interventions; evidence-informed decision-making; knowledge translation; population health; public health; realist reviews; scaling up; system planning,Article; attitude to health; clinical effectiveness; consultation; health care planning; health care system; human; intersectoral collaboration; knowledge translation; medical research; participatory research; peer review; process development; theoretical study; decision making; evidence based medicine; health care delivery; health care planning; knowledge; literature; methodology; population health; problem solving; public health; stakeholder engagement; translational research; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Evidence-Based Medicine; Health Planning; Humans; Knowledge; Population Health; Problem Solving; Public Health; Research Design; Review Literature as Topic; Stakeholder Participation; Translational Medical Research,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14784505,,,30348180,English,Health Res.

As a result, it constitutes a useful platform to benchmark theoretical calculations of exchange interactions in insulating Yb3+ magnets. Here we study Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 at low temperatures in applied magnetic fields as a further probe of the physics of this model system. Experimentally, we consider the behavior of polycrystalline samples of Ba3Yb2Zn5O11 with a combination of inelastic neutron scattering and heat capacity measurements down to 75 mK and up to fields of 10 T. Consistent with previous work, inelastic neutron scattering finds a level crossing near 3 T, but no significant dispersion of the spin excitations is detected up to the highest applied fields. Refinement of the theoretical model previously determined at zero field can reproduce much of the inelastic neutron scattering spectra and specific heat data. A notable exception is a low temperature peak in the specific heat at ?0.1 K. This may indicate the scale of interactions between tetrahedra or may reflect undetected disorder in Ba3Yb2Zn5O11. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.",anisotropic exchange; breathing pyrochlore; inelastic neutron scattering; Pyrochlore,Barium compounds; Crystal lattices; Inelastic neutron scattering; Magnetic fields; Specific heat; Temperature; Zinc compounds; Anisotropic exchange; Applied magnetic fields; Heat capacity measurements; Polycrystalline samples; Pyrochlore compounds; Pyrochlores; Theoretical calculations; Theoretical modeling; Ytterbium compounds,,Institute of Physics Publishing,9538984,,JCOME,30256218,English,J Phys Condens Matter,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055602162,

The strategic assessment is immediately needed to provide project-level guidance for decision makers who will be required under new federal legislation to consider the extent to which each assessed project ""contributes to sustainability"" and ""hinders or contributes to"" meeting Canada's climate commitments. However, Canada, like many other countries, has not yet translated its Paris Agreement climate commitments into an adequate suite of specific policies, pathways, budgets, and other directives for compliance. Consequently, the climate commitments' strategic assessment will need to play a fully strategic role-in policy development as well as policy interpretation and elaboration for assessment purposes. This paper outlines the key considerations and required steps for a strategic assessment that fills the policy gap between Paris and projects, and develops guidance centred on a suite of tests for evaluating proposed major projects that may have important effects on Canada's prospects for meeting its climate commitments. © 2018 by the authors.",Canada; Climate change; Impact assessment; Law; Mitigation; Paris Agreement; Project assessment climate policy; Strategic assessment,,,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055118251,

Participants were asked to complete four 24 h dietary recalls (24HRs) using the Automated Self-Administered 24-h Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24-Canada-2014), two SDQ administrations (prior to recalls one and four), and the System Usability Scale (SUS) for ASA24. For the SDQ administrations, Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ranged from 0.49 to 0.57 for nutrients and 0.35 to 0.72 for food groups. Mean intakes estimated from the SDQ were lower compared than those from the 24HRs. For nutrients, correlation coefficients were highest for fiber, calcium, and vitamin D (45–64 years: 0.59, 0.50, 0.51; >65 years: 0.29, 0.38, 0.49, p < 0.01); Kappas ranged from 0.14 to 0.37 in those 45–64 years and 0.17 to 0.32 in participants >65 years. Among the 70% who completed all recalls independently, the SUS indicated poor usability, though the majority reported feeling confident using ASA24. Overall, the SDQ captures intake with varying test-retest reliability and accuracy by nutrient and age. Further research is needed to inform use of a more comprehensive dietary measure in the CLSA. © 2018 by the authors.

Thraustochytrids are marine heterokonts that exhibit robust growth rates, high PUFA content, and more specifically, a large percentage of omega-3 fatty acids like docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) have been shown to improve the efficiency of organic solvent extraction of oils from wet oleaginous yeast and microalgae under mild conditions. Two ILs, the imidazolium 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate [C2mim][EtSO4] IL and the phosphonium (tetrabutylphosphonium propanoate [P4444][Prop]) IL were assessed for their ability to facilitate extraction of PUFA-containing lipids from a Thraustochytrium sp. (T18) through efficient cell wall disruption. The oil extracted after IL pretreatment was further characterized with respect to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition, while the effects of process parameters, such as the ratio of ionic liquid to co-solvent, the mass ratio of microalgae to the mixture of ionic liquid, and type of co-solvent were also investigated for both ILs. The results indicate that these ILs can disrupt the cells of Thraustochytrium sp. when mixed with a co-solvent (methanol), and facilitated the recovery of oils over a large degree of dewatered Thraustochytrium biomass (0-77.2 wt% water) in a short period of time (60 min) at ambient temperature, hence demonstrating a water compatible, low-energy, lipid recovery method. The lipid recovery was not affected by repeated usage of recycled ILs (tested up to five times). © 2018 by the authors.",Ionic liquids; Microalgae; Omega 3,Algae; Microorganisms; Mixtures; Organic solvents; Polyunsaturated fatty acids; Recovery; Solvent extraction; Docosahexaenoic acid; Fatty acid methyl ester; Ionic liquid (ils); Micro-algae; Omega-3; Omega-3-fatty acids; Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs); Process parameters; Ionic liquids,,MDPI AG,19961944,,,,English,Mater.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054970591,

Existing Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) tools provide modellers with little aid, partly because tool providers have not investigated users' difficulties through empirical investigations such as field studies. This paper presents the results of a two-phase user study to identify the most prominent difficulties that users might face when developing UML Class and State-Machine diagrams using UML modelling tools. In the first phase, we identified the preliminary modelling challenges by analysing 30 Class and State-Machine models that were previously developed by students as a course assignment. The result of the first phase helped us design the second phase of our user study where we empirically investigated different aspects of using modelling tools: the tools' effectiveness, users' efficiency, users' satisfaction, the gap between users' expectation and experience, and users' cognitive difficulties. Our results suggest that users' greatest difficulties are in (1) remembering contextual information and (2) identifying and fixing errors and inconsistencies. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The energy dissipation of the entire joint surface is estimated by energy loss equation of single micro-convex body. According to the tangential force in process of micro-convex and micro-slip, the energy storage of the micro-convex body is replaced by the equivalent, and the energy storage of the composite surface of the rectifier is obtained. On the basis of the unique conversion of energy loss and storage, a model is established. The model avoids the invariance of experimental test and enhances the visualization of theoretical derivation, and can more intuitively understand the properties of damping dissipation factor. The influence law of related parameters is obtained by numerical simulation. We can see that damping loss factor of tangential decreases first and then increases when D increase and the roughness arguments are constant. When D is about 1.25, the D reaches the least value. If the D is less than 1.5, the roughness parameter and directly proportional damping dissipation factor relations, when the fractal dimension is 1.5 exactly, the roughness parameters do not produce effect, when the D is larger than 1.5, the increase of roughness, dissipation factor decreases at the same time. Comparing with the laboratory data, the results obtained by numerical simulation are in accordance with the actual situation is found. Therefore, the model is effective in certain conditions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Digital storage; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Environmental management; Fractal dimension; Numerical models; Damping loss factor; Dissipation factors; Experimental test; Hertz contact theory; Proportional damping; Roughness parameters; Tangential contact; Theoretical derivations; Damping,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17551307,,,,English,IOP Conf.

However, given the limited research pertaining to SCG use, little is currently known about the manner in which adolescents engage with this new gambling medium. The present study aims to identify the factors that characterize adolescent social casino gamers, and to determine whether these factors differ by SCG type. Moreover, the study examines the extent to which social casino gaming is associated with monetary gambling and problem gambling in this cohort. Method: Data were obtained from students in Grades 9 to 12 (n = 10,035) residing in the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Participants completed the Youth Gambling Survey (YGS), which is a supplementary instrument administered alongside the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CSTADS). Logistic regression was used to assess the factors associated with SCG play. Results: Overall, 12.4% of respondents reported having participated in SCGs in the past three months. Compared to adolescents who did not report playing SCGs, SCG players were typically more likely to participate in monetary gambling activities, and were more prevalently classified as problem gamblers of low-to-moderate severity or high severity. Although profiles of SCG players differed across SCG game types, factors significantly associated with the playing of SCGs were gender, weekly spending money, having friends and parents who gamble, and screen time. It was also shown that current smokers were significantly more likely to participate in simulated slots online relative to adolescents who did not play SCGs. Conclusion: Significant associations exist between SCG play, monetary gambling, and problem gambling among adolescents. Gambling intervention efforts directed at this population should aim to identify personal and environmental factors associated with social casino gaming, and should be tailored to different types of SCGs. © 2018 The Author(s).",Adolescent; Facebook; Poker; Simulated gambling; Slots; Social casino games,"adolescent; Canada; epidemiology; family; female; friend; gambling; human; male; psychology; questionnaire; recreational game; risk factor; sex ratio; social behavior; social media; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; student; utilization; young adult; Adolescent; Canada; Family; Female; Friends; Gambling; Games, Recreational; Humans; Male; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Social Behavior; Social Media; Socioeconomic Factors; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712458,,,30305091,English,BMC Public Health,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054773652,

However, generally, initial implementations with practical imperfections might open loopholes, allowing an eavesdropper to compromise the security of a quantum cryptographic system. This has been shown to happen for quantum key distribution (QKD). Here we apply experience from implementation security of QKD to several other quantum cryptographic primitives. We survey quantum digital signatures, quantum secret sharing, source-independent quantum random number generation, quantum secure direct communication, and blind quantum computing. We propose how the eavesdropper could in principle exploit the loopholes to violate assumptions in these protocols, breaking their security properties. Applicable countermeasures are also discussed. It is important to consider potential implementation security issues early in protocol design, to shorten the path to future applications. © 2018 The Author(s).

We describe techniques to prepare and characterize neutron spin-orbit states, and provide a quantitative comparison to known procedures. The proposed detection method directly measures the correlations of spin state and transverse momentum, and overcomes the major challenges associated with neutrons, which are low flux and small spatial coherence length. Our preparation techniques, utilizing special geometries of magnetic fields, are based on coherent averaging and spatial control methods borrowed from nuclear magnetic resonance.

Critically, widespread misconceptions about laboratory-reported microbial non-detects have led to their erroneous description and handling as ""censored"" values. This ultimately compromises their interpretation and undermines efforts to describe and model microbial concentrations accurately. Herein, these misconceptions are dispelled by (1) discussing the critical differences between discrete microbial observations and continuous data acquired using analytical chemistry methodologies and (2) demonstrating the bias introduced by statistical approaches tailored for chemistry data and misapplied to discrete microbial data. Notably, these approaches especially preclude the accurate representation of low concentrations and those estimated using microbial methods with low or variable analytical recovery, which can be expected to result in non-detects. Techniques that account for the probabilistic relationship between observed data and underlying microbial concentrations have been widely demonstrated, and their necessity for handling non-detects (in a way which is consistent with the handling of positive observations) is underscored herein. Habitual reporting of raw microbial observations and sample sizes is proposed to facilitate accurate estimation and analysis of microbial concentrations. © 2018 Chik, Schmidt and Emelko.",Censored data; Detection limit; Microbial risk assessment; Pathogens; Presence-absence; QMRA; Zeros,article; chemistry; infectious agent; learning; limit of detection; nonhuman; public health; risk assessment; sample size,,Frontiers Media S.A.,1664302X,,,,English,Front.

We examined the relationship between staffing characteristics and residents' quality of care indicators at the unit level in LTC homes. Methods: This cross-sectional study collected data from administrative records and resident assessments from July 2014 to June 2015 at 11 LTC homes in Ontario, Canada comprising of 55 units and 32 residents in each unit. The sample included 69 registered nurses, 183 licensed/registered practical nurses, 858 nursing assistants, and 2173 residents. Practice sensitive, risk-adjusted quality indicators were described individually, then combined to create a quality of care composite ranking per unit. A multilevel regression model was used to estimate the association between staffing characteristics and quality of care composite ranking scores. Results: Nursing assistants provided the majority of direct care hours in LTC homes (76.5%). The delivery of nursing assistant care hours per resident per day was significantly associated with higher quality of resident care (p = < 0.01). There were small but significant associations with quality of care for nursing assistants with seven or more years of experience (p = 0.02), nursing assistants late to shift (p = < 0.01) and licensed/registered practical nurses late to shift (p = 0.02). Conclusions: The number of care hours per resident per day delivered by NAs is an important contributor to residents' quality of care in LTC homes. These findings can inform hiring and retention strategies for NAs in LTC, as well as examine opportunities to optimize the NA role in these settings. © 2018 The Author(s).",Health care aides; Long-term care; Nursing assistants; Nursing homes; Quality of care,aged; aggression; clinical trial; cognitive defect; cross-sectional study; daily life activity; dementia; disabled person; female; health care quality; home for the aged; human; long term care; male; measurement accuracy; multicenter study; nursing home; Ontario; personnel management; standards; statistics and numerical data; urine incontinence; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aggression; Cognition Disorders; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Accuracy; Dementia; Disabled Persons; Female; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Long-Term Care; Male; Nursing Assistants; Nursing Homes; Ontario; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Quality of Health Care; Urinary Incontinence; Workforce,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14726963,,,30285716,English,BMC Health Serv.

The purpose of this study was to propose a source pollution control measure based on the spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of the runoff pollutants at urban pavement sites. Therefore, samples from pavement runoff were collected and tested for analyzing the spatial-temporal distribution characteristics. Then, infiltration tests were conducted on selected purification materials to evaluate their purification ability to the simulated pavement runoff. Results indicated that heavy metals Zn and Pb were at high concentrations near the intersection, the reason being the frequent braking of vehicles at this site. The level of suspended solids was far higher than the limitation in the standard near the site where massive human activities occurred. Besides, the cumulative amounts of all kinds of pollutants tended to be stable with the extension of rainfall duration. The logarithmic function was found to fit the experimental data well. Finally, the pavement runoff was categorized into different situations. The combinations of purification materials were recommended and integrated into a source control measure for the treatments of different pollution situations, which made the most use of each purification material and ensured the high elimination efficiency of different pollutants. © 2018 by the authors.",Pavement engineering; Purification materials; Runoff pollutants; Source control measures; Spatial-temporal distribution,,,MDPI AG,20763417,,,,English,Appl.

Physical literacy is an evolving construct representing foundational domains upon which physically active lifestyles are based. Many sectors and organizations in Canada are embracing physical literacy in their programs, practices, policies, and research; however, the use of inconsistent definitions and conceptualizations of physical literacy had been identified by stakeholders as hindering promotion and advancement efforts. Methods: With leadership from ParticipACTION, organizations from the physical activity, public health, sport, physical education, and recreation sectors collaborated to create a physical literacy consensus definition and position statement for use by all Canadian organizations and individuals. The process involved an environmental scan, survey of related evidence, stakeholder consultations, and creation of a Steering Committee. From this background work a consensus statement was drafted, shared with stakeholders, revised, and ratified. Results: Canada's Physical Literacy Consensus Statement was launched in June 2015 at the International Physical Literacy Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. To further promote the Consensus Statement, the Sport for Life Society developed and simultaneously released the ""Vancouver Declaration"", which contained additional guidance on physical literacy. Both the Consensus Statement and the Declaration endorsed the International Physical Literacy Association's definition of physical literacy, namely ""the motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and understanding to value and take responsibility for engagement in physical activities for life"". Conclusions: Sector partners hope that the Consensus Statement, with its standardized definition, brings greater harmony, synergy, and consistency to physical literacy efforts in Canada and internationally. Going forward, the impact of this initiative on the sector, and the more distal goal of increasing habitual physical activity levels, should be assessed. © 2018 The Author(s).",Confidence; Consensus; Definition; Health; Motivation; Physical activity; Physical competence; Physical literacy; Sedentary behaviour,"adolescent; Canada; child; consensus; exercise; female; health literacy; human; male; practice guideline; preschool child; Adolescent; Canada; Child; Child, Preschool; Consensus; Exercise; Female; Guidelines as Topic; Health Literacy; Humans; Male",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712458,,,30285701,English,BMC Public Health,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054317051,

We undertake an intersectional analysis that examines dynamics between groups of fisherwomen in relation to social-ecological change. We focus specifically on (1) fisherwomen’s perspectives about the key drivers of change (e.g., natural disasters and aquaculture) within the social and ecological system of Chilika lagoon; (2) how environmental change is impacting the livelihoods and coping responses of fisherwomen; and (3) how fisherwomen communities are adapting to the ongoing process of change, highlighting in particular the gendered dimensions of out-migration. Our findings demonstrate that fisherwomen’s roles and identities are not static and that the impacts of environmental change vary for different groups of fisherwomen. We find that gender intersects with caste, income, geographic location, age, and household membership to create heterogeneous experiences and knowledge that reflects the complexities associated with gender and environmental change. With specific regard to the increase in fisherwomen out-migrating, we show that responses and adaptations to environmental change have gender-differentiated impacts and challenges. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Chilika lagoon; Environmental change; Out-migration; Small-scale fisheries; Women,,,Springer Verlag,18727859,,,,English,Marit.

The composites’ thermal stability, crystallization behaviour, tensile strength, and electrical property are carefully examined. The thermal stability is significantly enhanced with the incorporation of small-sized GnPs as shown by the 11.2% improvement in T5% (the temperature at which 5 wt% of the mass loss occurs) and 5.1% improvement in Tmax (the temperature at which the maximum loss rate occurs). The thermal stabilizing effect of fillers can be significantly enhanced when they are well distributed with less aggregation as is the case for small-sized GnPs. The GnPs show a considerable nucleating effect on PP by increasing the crystallization temperature (Tc). The greatest improvement in tensile property is achieved with the use of small-sized GnPs. A 33.0% enhancement in tensile strength and 59.1% improvement of tensile modulus are obtained with the use of C300 and M5, respectively. The significantly increased thermal stability and mechanical property with small-sized GnPs are due to the fact that these small-sized fillers achieve a high degree of dispersion with less agglomeration as shown in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. However, the fillers with a large sheet size are still beneficial for purposes concerning electrical conductivity since the lowest percolation is obtained with H100. The greater the size of the GnPs, the smaller the percolation threshold of composites is exhibited. © BME-PT.",Electrical conductivity; Graphene nano-platelets; Polymer composites; Polypropylene; Tensile property,Electric conductivity; Extrusion; Fillers; Graphene; Injection molding; Platelets; Polypropylenes; Scanning electron microscopy; Solvents; Technetium compounds; Tensile properties; Thermodynamic stability; Crystallization behaviours; Crystallization temperature; Electrical conductivity; Nano-platelets; Percolation thresholds; Polymer composite; The scanning electron microscopes (SEM); Thermal stabilizing effects; Tensile strength,,BME-PT and GTE,1788618X,,,,English,Express Polym.

Although academic information retrieval researchers have a long history of building and sharing systems, they are primarily designed to facilitate the publication of research papers. As such, these systems are often incomplete, inflexible, poorly documented, difcult to use, and slow, particularly in the context of modern web-scale collections. Furthermore, the growing complexity of modern software ecosystems and the resource constraints most academic research groups operate under make maintaining open-source systems a constant struggle. However, except for a small number of companies (mostly commercial web search engines) that deploy custom infrastructure, Lucene has become the de facto platform in industry for building search applications. Lucene has an active developer base, a large audience of users, and diverse capabilities to work with heterogeneous collections at scale. However, it lacks systematic support for ad hoc experimentation using standard test collections. We describe Anserini, an information retrieval toolkit built on Lucene that flls this gap. Our goal is to simplify ad hoc experimentation and allow researchers to easily reproduce results with modern bag-of-words ranking models on diverse test collections. With Anserini, we demonstrate that Lucene provides a suitable framework for supporting information retrieval research. Experiments show that our system efciently indexes large web collections, provides modern ranking models that are on par with research implementations in terms of effectiveness, and supports low-latency query evaluation to facilitate rapid experimentation. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Ad hoc retrieval; TREC,Information retrieval; Open source software; Open systems; Ad Hoc retrieval; Heterogeneous collections; Information retrieval research; Open source system; Resource Constraint; Search application; Software ecosystems; TREC; Search engines,,Association for Computing Machinery,19361955,,,,English,J.

Numerical solutions were obtained, as well as asymptotic approximations based on the assumption of perturbations of long wavelength and small variation in the consistency of the fluid with respect to temperature. We investigate the critical conditions for the onset of instability and determine the effect of a non-Newtonian rheology and the dependence of the fluid properties on temperature.

In particular, this method reconstructs the spin network basis and yields a novel dual spin network basis. While the spin network basis allows to interpret states in terms of electric excitations, on top of a vacuum sharply peaked on a vanishing electric field, the dual spin network basis describes magnetic (or curvature) excitations, on top of a vacuum sharply peaked on a vanishing magnetic field (or flat connection). This technique is also applicable for manifolds with boundaries. We distinguish in particular a dual pair of boundary conditions, namely of electric type and of magnetic type. This can be used to consider a generalization of Ocneanu’s tube algebra in order to reveal the algebraic structure of the excitations associated with certain 3d manifolds. © 2018, The Author(s).",Gauge Symmetry; Lattice Quantum Field Theory; Topological States of Matter,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

Aquaria and aquaculture systems therefore use biological filters that promote the growth of nitrifiers to convert ammonia to nitrate. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) have been isolated from aquarium biofilters and are available as commercial supplements, but recent evidence suggests that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are abundant in aquarium biofilters. In this study, we report the cultivation and closed genome sequence of the novel AOA representative ""Candidatus Nitrosotenuis aquarius,"" which was enriched from a freshwater aquarium biofilter. ""Ca. Nitrosotenuis aquarius"" oxidizes ammonia stoichiometrically to nitrite with a concomitant increase in thaumarchaeotal cells and a generation time of 34.9 h. ""Ca. Nitrosotenuis aquarius"" has an optimal growth temperature of 33°C, tolerates up to 3 mM NH 4 Cl, and grows optimally at 0.05% salinity. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that ""Ca. Nitrosotenuis aquarius"" cells are rod shaped, with a diameter of ~0.4 ?m and length ranging from 0.6 to 3.6 ?m. In addition, these cells possess surface layers (S-layers) and multiple proteinaceous appendages. Phylogenetically, ""Ca. Nitrosotenuis aquarius"" belongs to the group I.1a Thaumarchaeota, clustering with environmental sequences from freshwater aquarium biofilters, aquaculture systems, and wastewater treatment plants. The complete 1.70- Mbp genome contains genes involved in ammonia oxidation, bicarbonate assimilation, flagellum synthesis, chemotaxis, S-layer production, defense, and protein glycosylation.

The gradient changes of multiple projections in local windows of gray-level images are encoded to build a histogram that captures spatial projection patterns. Using projections is a conventional technique in both medical imaging and computer vision. Furthermore, powerful dense-sampling methods, such as local binary patterns and the histogram of oriented gradients, are widely used for image classification and recognition. Inspired by many achievements of such existing descriptors, we explore the design of a new class of histogram-based descriptors with particular applications in medical imaging. We experiment with three public datasets (IRMA, Kimia Path24, and CT Emphysema) to comparatively evaluate the performance of ELP histograms. In light of the tremendous success of deep architectures, we also compare the results with deep features generated by pretrained networks. The results are quite encouraging as the ELP descriptor can surpass both conventional and deep descriptors in performance in several experimental settings. © 1964-2012 IEEE.",Deep features; histopathology images; image classification; image retrieval; LBP; medical image retrieval; projections; radon transform,Computerized tomography; Feature extraction; Graphic methods; Mathematical transformations; Radon; Robustness (control systems); Biomedical imaging; Classification and recognition; Conventional techniques; Experimental settings; Histogram of oriented gradients; Histograms; Local binary patterns; Shape; Medical imaging; Article; calculation; classification algorithm; computer assisted tomography; data base; diagnostic imaging; encoded local projection; feature extraction; histogram; image analysis; image retrieval; information processing; intermethod comparison; mathematical analysis; measurement accuracy; measurement error; pattern recognition; support vector machine; task performance; thorax radiography; validation process,,IEEE Computer Society,189294,,IEBEA,29993412,English,IEEE Trans.

This paper provides a research update on the biologically inspired liquid-enabled gating mechanism that acts as a novel filtration and separation approach offering reduction in transmembrane pressure (TMP), improved throughput, and reduced fouling. We study the performance of such Liquid Gated Membranes (LGMs) and present their benefits for filtration in the presence of model inorganic (nanoclay particles) fouling. We show over twofold higher throughput, nearly threefold longer time to foul, more than 60% reduction in irreversible fouling, ability to return to baseline pressures after backwashing along with reduction in use of backwash water, and 10%-15% reduction in TMP for filtration of nanoclay particles. Fouling models exhibit not only delayed onset of fouling for LGMs compared to the control but also different fouling characteristics.

Investigating the thermal behavior of lithium-ion pouch cells and optimizing the cooling performance are required to accomplish better performance, long life, and enhanced safety. In the present study, the cooling performance characteristics of 20 Ah lithium-ion pouch cell with cold plates along both surfaces are investigated by varying the inlet coolant mass flow rates and the inlet coolant temperatures. The inlet coolant mass flow rate is varied from 0.000833 kg/s to 0.003333 kg/s, and the inlet coolant temperature is varied from 5°C to 35°C. In addition, the effects of the cold plate geometry parameter on cooling performance of 20 Ah lithium-ion pouch cell are studied by varying the number of the channels from 4 to 10.

The cooling energy efficiency parameter (?) and the pressure drop for 20 Ah lithium-ion pouch cell with cold plates along both surfaces are also reported.

However, existing methods to assess skeletal muscle from CT are time-consuming, expensive, and require training. Clinic-friendly tools to screen for low skeletal muscle in cancer patients are urgently needed. Methods: We included 807 scans from non-metastatic colorectal cancer patients. With the digital ruler available in most radiological software, we implemented an abbreviated method to assess skeletal muscle area at the third lumbar vertebra (L3), which consisted of assessing the height and width of the psoas and paraspinal muscles and computing their combined ‘linear area’ in centimetres squared (cm2). A subset of CT scans was assessed twice by two analysts to compute intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. We derived cut-points for ‘low’ linear area using optimal stratification and then calculated the sensitivity and specificity of these cut-points relative to standard methods (total L3 cross-sectional area assessed with Slice-O-Matic research software). We further evaluated the association of low linear area with death from any cause after colorectal cancer diagnosis in Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for demographics, smoking, body mass index category, and tumour characteristics. Results: The linear area was highly correlated with total cross-sectional area assessed using standard methods [r = 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91, 0.93] overall and within subgroups defined by age, sex, and body mass index group. Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were equally high (both intra-class correlations = 0.98). Cut-points for low linear area were sensitive (0.75; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.80) and specific (0.77; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.80) for identifying low skeletal muscle relative to the standard of total L3 cross-sectional area. The hazard ratio and 95% CI for death associated with a low linear area were hazard ratio = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.25. Conclusions: Clinic-friendly methods that assess linear area from CT scans are an accurate screening tool to identify low skeletal muscle among non-metastatic colorectal cancer patients. These linear measures are associated with mortality after colorectal cancer, suggesting they could be clinically useful both to improve prognostication and to provide a practical screening tool to identify cancer patients who require nutrition or exercise intervention. © 2018 The Authors.

In primary care, clinician behaviors and attitudes are important precursors to structured data entry, and there is an impact on overall data quality. We hypothesized that persuasive design changes data-entry behaviors in clinicians and thus improves data quality. Objective: The objective of this study was to use persuasive design principles to change clinician data-entry behaviors in a primary care environment and to increase data quality of data held in a family health team’s reporting system. Methods: We used the persuasive systems design framework to describe the persuasion context. Afterward, we designed and implemented new features into a summary screen that leveraged several persuasive design principles. We tested the influence of the new features by measuring its impact on 3 data quality measures (same-day entry, record completeness, and data validity). We also measured the impacts of the new features with a paired pre-post t test and generated XmR charts to contextualize the results. Survey responses were also collected from users. Results: A total of 53 users used the updated system that incorporated the new features over the course of 8 weeks. Based on a pre-post analysis, the new summary screen successfully encouraged users to enter more of their data on the same day as their encounter. On average, the percentage of same-day entries rose by 10.3% for each user (P<.001). During the first month of the postimplementation period, users compensated by sacrificing aspects of data completeness before returning to normal in the second month. Improvements to record validity were marginal over the study period (P=.05). Statistical process control techniques allowed us to study the XmR charts to contextualize our results and understand trends throughout the study period. Conclusions: By conducting a detailed systems analysis and introducing new persuasive design elements into a data-entry system, we demonstrated that it was possible to change data-entry behavior and influence data quality in a reporting system. The results show that using persuasive design concepts May be effective in influencing data-entry behaviors in clinicians. There May be opportunities to continue improving this approach, and further work is required to perfect and test additional designs. Persuasive design is a viable approach to encourage clinician user change and could support better data capture in the field of medical informatics. © Justin St-Maurice, Catherine Burns, Justin Wolting.",Data accuracy; Data collection; Data entry; Health care; Persuasive design; Persuasive systems design framework; User interface,,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,14388871,,,,English,J.

In D = 4, we consider Einsteinian cubic gravity, for which we construct solutions with ? = S2, T2. These represent the first generalizations of the Einstein gravity Taub-NUT/bolt solutions for any higher-curvature theory in four dimensions. In D = 6, we show that no new solutions are allowed for any Generalized quasi-topological gravity at cubic order. They exist however when we consider quartic Quasi-topological and Generalized quasi-topological terms, for which we construct new solutions with ?=??2,S2ЧS2,S2ЧT2,T2ЧT2. In all cases, the solutions are characterized by a single metric function, and they reduce to the corresponding ones in Einstein gravity when the higher-curvature couplings are set to zero. While the explicit profiles must be constructed numerically (except for a few cases), we obtain fully analytic expressions for the thermodynamic properties of all solutions. The new solutions present important differences with respect to Einstein gravity, including regular bolts for arbitrary values of the NUT charge, critical points, and re-entrant phase transitions. © 2018, The Author(s).",AdS-CFT Correspondence; Black Holes; Classical Theories of Gravity,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

Design Population-based cohort study. Setting Patients attending primary care practices registered with the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Participants Using the UK-based CPRD, we identified two incretin-based therapies cohorts: (1) dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i)-cohort, consisting of new users of DPP-4i and SU and (2) glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA)-cohort, consisting of new users of GLP-1RA and SU, between January 2007 and January 2016. Patients with a prior history of depression, self-harm and other serious psychiatric conditions were excluded. Main outcome measures The primary study outcome comprised a composite of new-onset depression or self-harm. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to quantify the association between incretin-based therapies and depression or self-harm. Deciles of High-Dimensional Propensity Scores and concurrent number of glucose-lowering agents were used to adjust for potential confounding. Results We identified new users of 6206 DPP-4i and 22 128 SU in the DPP-4i-cohort, and 501 GLP-1RA and 16 409 SU new users in the GLP-1RA-cohort. The incidence of depression or self-harm was 8.2 vs 11.7 events/1000 person-years in the DPP-4i-cohort and 18.2 vs 13.6 events/1000 person-years in the GLP-1RA-cohort for incretin-based therapies versus SU, respectively. Incretin-based therapies were not associated with an increased or decreased incidence of depression or self-harm compared with SU (DPP-4i-cohort: Unadjusted HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96; adjusted HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.13; GLP-1RA-cohort: Unadjusted HR 1.36, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.58; adjusted HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.50). Consistent results were observed for other glucose-lowering comparators including insulin and thiazolidinediones. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the two incretin-based therapies are not associated with an increased or decreased risk of depression or self-harm. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

Using simplicial arguments, we emphasize how the consistency condition of the unitary map performing a local change of triangulation is equivalent to the coherence relation of the pentagonator 2-morphism of a monoidal 2-category. By weakening some axioms of such 2-category, we obtain a cohomological model whose underlying 1-category is a 2-group. Topological models from 2-groups together with their lattice realization are then studied from a higher gauge theory point of view. Symmetry protected topological phases protected by higher symmetry structures are explicitly constructed, and the gauging procedure which yields the corresponding topological gauge theories is discussed in detail. We finally study the correspondence between symmetry protected topological phases and ’t Hooft anomalies in the context of these higher group symmetries. © 2018, The Author(s).",Gauge Symmetry; Topological Field Theories; Topological States of Matter,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

The complexity of the coherent states have the same UV divergences as the vacuum state complexity and so we consider the finite increase of the complexity of these states over the vacuum state. One observation is that generally, the optimal circuits introduce entanglement between the normal modes at intermediate stages even though our reference state and target states are not entangled in this basis. We also compare our results from Nielsen’s approach with those found using the Fubini-Study method of [2]. For general coherent states, we find that the complexities, as well as the optimal circuits, derived from these two approaches, are different. © 2018, The Author(s).",AdS-CFT Correspondence; Black Holes in String Theory; Effective Field Theories; Lattice Quantum Field Theory,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

We apply this method to various effective field theories with and without color degrees of freedom. In the colored case, we study the U(N) non-linear sigma model of Goldstone bosons (NLSM) in a recent parametrization due to Cheung and Shen, as well as its extension involving a coupling to the bi-adjoint scalar. We propose a Lagrangian and a Cachazo-He-Yuan formula for the latter valid in multi-trace sectors and systematically calculate its amplitudes. Furthermore, we make a similar proposal for a higher-derivative correction to NLSM that agrees with the subleading order of the abelian Z-theory. In the colorless cases, we formulate perturbiner expansions for the special Galileon and Born-Infeld theories.

Generally, scholars propose addressing this problem by increasing agricultural production, investing in technology to boost yields, changing diets, or reducing food waste. In this paper, we explore whether global food production is nutritionally balanced by comparing the diet that nutritionists recommend versus global agricultural production statistics. Results show that the global agricultural system currently overproduces grains, fats, and sugars while production of fruits and vegetables and protein is not sufficient to meet the nutritional needs of the current population. Correcting this imbalance could reduce the amount of arable land used by agriculture by 51 million ha globally but would increase total land used for agriculture by 407 million ha and increase greenhouse gas emissions. For a growing population, our calculations suggest that the only way to eat a nutritionally balanced diet, save land and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to consume and produce more fruits and vegetables as well as transition to diets higher in plant-based protein. Such a move will help protect habitats and help meet the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2018 KC et al.

Part 2 provides a detailed analysis of on-road and off-road information inventory methods, including the detection and extraction of on-road objects (e.g., road surface, road markings, driving lines, and road crack) and off-road objects (e.g., pole-like objects and power lines). Part 3 presents a refined integrated analysis of challenges and future trends. Our review shows that MLS technology is well proven in urban object detection and extraction, since the improvement of hardware and software accelerate the efficiency and accuracy of data collection and processing. When compared to other review papers focusing on MLS applications, we review the state-of-the-art road object detection and extraction methods using MLS data and discuss their performance and applicability. The main contribution of this review demonstrates that the MLS systems are suitable for supporting road asset inventory, ITS-related applications, high-definition maps, and other highly accurate localization services. © 2018 by the authors.",Deep learning; Driving line; Mobile laser scanning (MLS); Point cloud; Power line; Road crack; Road marking; Road surface; Street light; Traffic sign; Tree,Data handling; Deep learning; Extraction; Highway markings; Laser applications; Object detection; Object recognition; Roads and streets; Street lighting; Traffic signs; Driving line; Laser scanning; Point cloud; Power lines; Road cracks; Road marking; Road surfaces; Tree; Road and street markings,,MDPI AG,20724292,,,,English,Remote Sens.,Review,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055455873,

This entity often presents with scrotal mass, inguinal hernia, or cryptorchidism. Herein, we report our experience with a boy who presented with a scrotal enlargement which later turned out to be SGF. Moreover, an accessory spleen was unexpectedly found in the left inguinal canal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of SGF and accessory spleen in the literature. Although rare, SGF should be included in the complete differential diagnosis list of scrotal masses, especially in children. The use of frozen section pathology if available would aid the surgeon in avoiding unnecessary orchiectomy in small testicular masses of benign origin. © 2018 Medknow Publications.

Pediatric clinical pharmacologists may be physicians but are more likely to be pharmacists or PhD scientists, and pediatric clinical pharmacology today is largely a research specialty rather than a subspecialty for direct patient care. Pharmacometrics, including “top-down” population modeling and “bottom-up” physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling, has become an indispensable tool for pharmaceutical industry scientists, government regulators, academic researchers, and even a handful of patient-oriented practitioners. This review summarizes the application of pharmacometrics within each of these domains and predicts future trends of further applications across the spectrum of pediatric clinical pharmacology from drug development to patient care. © 2018, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology",clinical pharmacology; modeling; pediatric; pharmacometrics; simulation; therapeutic drug monitoring,algorithm; allometry; Article; clinical pharmacology; drug industry; food and drug administration; human; minimum inhibitory concentration; molecular dynamics; mycosis; patient care; pharmacist; pharmacodynamic parameters; pharmacokinetic parameters; pharmacologist,,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,912700,,JCPCB,,English,J.

It is conventionally considered to be characterized by a closure temperature range between 375 and 600 °C and hence has been employed to address mid-temperature thermochronology questions relevant to the reconstruction of thermal events in the middle to lower crust. However, questions remain as to whether apatite faithfully records thermally-activated volume diffusion profiles, or rather is influenced by recrystallization and new growth processes. We present a case study of two apatite samples from the Akia Terrane in Greenland that help chart some of the post magmatic history of this region. Apatite in a tonalitic gneiss has distinct U-enriched rims and its U-Pb apparent ages correlate with Mn chemistry, with a high Mn group yielding an age of c. 2813 Ma. The U-Pb and trace element chemistry and morphology support an interpretation in which these apatite crystals are originally igneous and record cooling after metamorphism, with subsequent generation of discrete new rims. Epidote observed in the sample implies a <600 °C fluid infiltration event associated with apatite rims. The second sample, from a granitic leucosome, contains apparently homogeneous apatite, however U-Pb analyses define two distinct discordia arrays with different common Pb components. An older, c. 2490 Ma, component is associated with elevated Sr, whereas a younger, c. 1800 Ma, component has lower Sr concentration. A depth profile reveals an older core with progressively younger ages towards a compositionally discrete late Paleoproterozoic rim. The chemical and age profiles do not directly correspond, implying different diffusion rates between trace elements and U and Pb. The variation in core ages is interpreted to reflect radiogenic-Pb loss from a metamorphic population during new rim growth. The younger, c. 1800 Ma U-Pb age is interpreted to date new apatite growth from a compositionally distinct reservoir driven by tectonothermal and fluid activity, consistent with regional mica Ar-Ar ages. Results from these two samples show that recrystallization, dissolution and regrowth processes likely formed the younger rim overgrowths, and at temperatures below those often considered to be closure temperatures for Pb diffusion in apatite. The results from these samples imply many apatite grains may not record simple thermally activated Pb diffusion profiles and cautions against inversion of apatite U-Pb data to thermal histories without detailed knowledge of the grain growth/alteration processes. © 2018 The Authors",Apatite; Geochronology; Greenland; Metamorphism; Pseudosection; Themochronology; U-Pb,apatite; argon-argon dating; diagram; metamorphism; recrystallization; regrowth; thermochronology; trace element; uranium-lead dating; Arctic; Greenland,,Elsevier B.V.,244937,,,,English,Lithos,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051636362,

Methods: HOA values were obtained from the corneal surface (CS) and whole eye (WE), using a corneal topographer and Shack–Hartmann aberrometer, from both eyes of 50 subjects (25 females, mean age ± sd 32.5 ± 11.0 years, and 25 males, 33.88 ± 11.2 years) for two pupil sizes (3 and 6 mm) in a dark environment. One drop of Blink Contacts™ (Abbott Medical Optics) was instilled into the right eye and HOA measurements repeated after 30 s. After 1 h, the meibomian glands of the left lower eyelid were gently squeezed and HOA measurements repeated after 30 s. Results: There was no significant difference for CS and WE root mean square (RMS) HOAs between right and left eyes before (both pupil sizes) and after TE use or ME (3 mm pupil). For 6 mm pupil, TE use significantly reduced the WE RMS HOA (p &lt; 0.05, mean ± sd) for Z4 0 (0.297 ± 0.136 to 0.053 ± 0.069), and Z5 5 (0.221 ± 0.372 to 0.098 ± 0.121) while ME significantly increased CS RMS HOA (p &lt; 0.05, mean ± sd) for Z3 ?3 (0.799 ± 1.178 to 1.302 ± 1.991) and Z4 4 (0.594 ± 1.184 to 0.988 ± 1.463). In general, the change in HOA was significantly correlated with the initial value before TE use or ME (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: There were no detectable differences between right and left eyes. For the 6 mm pupil, the tear enhancer tended to improve optical performance of the WE and meibomian gland expression tended to reduce the optical performance at the CS. © 2018 Spanish General Council of Optometry",High order aberrations; Meibomian gland expression; Tears; Tears enhancer,hyaluronic acid; viscosupplement; adult; cornea; corneal wavefront aberration; drug effect; female; human; keratometry; male; meibomian gland; metabolism; middle aged; young adult; Adult; Cornea; Corneal Topography; Corneal Wavefront Aberration; Female; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Male; Meibomian Glands; Middle Aged; Viscosupplements; Young Adult,,Spanish Council of Optometry,18884296,,,29699948,English; Spanish,J.

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of an evidence-informed smartphone app for smoking cessation, Crush the Crave (CTC), on reducing smoking prevalence among young adult smokers in comparison with an evidence-informed self-help guide, On the Road to Quitting (OnRQ). Methods: A parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with 2 arms was conducted in Canada to evaluate CTC. In total, 1599 young adult smokers (aged 19 to 29 years) intending to quit smoking in the next 30 days were recruited online and randomized to receive CTC or the control condition OnRQ for a period of 6 months. The primary outcome measure was self-reported continuous abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. Results: Overall follow-up rates were 57.41% (918/1599) and 60.48% (967/1599) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Moreover, 45.34% (725/1599) of participants completed baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis (last observation carried forward) showed that continuous abstinence (N=1599) at 6 months was not significantly different at 7.8% (64/820) for CTC versus 9.2% (72/779) for OnRQ (odds ratio; OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59-1.18). Similarly, 30-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months was not significantly different at 14.4% (118/820) and 16.9% (132/779) for CTC and OnRQ, respectively (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.63-1.08). However, these rates of abstinence were favorable compared with unassisted 30-day quit rates of 11.5% among young adults. Secondary measures of quit attempts and the number of cigarettes smoked per day at 6-month follow-up did not reveal any significant differences between groups. For those who completed the 6-month follow-up, 85.1% (359/422) of young adult smokers downloaded CTC as compared with 81.8% (346/423) of OnRQ, ? 2 1(N=845) =1.6, P=.23. Furthermore, OnRQ participants reported significantly higher levels of overall satisfaction (mean 3.3 [SD 1.1] vs mean 2.6 [SD 1.3]; t 644 =6.87, P&lt;.001), perceived helpfulness (mean 5.8 [SD 2.4] vs mean 4.3 [SD 2.6], t 657 =8.0, P&lt;.001), and frequency of use (mean 3.6 [SD 1.2] vs mean 3.2 [SD 1.1], t 683 =5.7, P&lt;.001) compared with CTC participants. Conclusions: CTC was feasible for delivering cessation support but was not superior to a self-help guide in helping motivated young adults to quit smoking. CTC will benefit from further formative research to address satisfaction and usage. As smartphone apps may not serve as useful alternatives to printed self-help guides, there is a need to conduct further research to understand how digital mobile technology smoking cessation interventions for smoking cessation can be improved. © Neill Bruce Baskerville, Laura Louise Struik, Godefroy Emmanuel Guindon, Cameron D Norman, Robyn Whittaker, Catherine Burns, David Hammond, Darly Dash, K Stephen Brown.",Health behavior; mHealth; Mobile phone; Randomized controlled trial; Smoking cessation; Young adult,,,JMIR Publications,22915222,,,,English,JMIR mHealth uHealth,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060335969,

Egypt has used pictorial health warnings (PHWs) on waterpipe tobacco packs (WTPs) and has rotated these every two years since 2008. We explored in this qualitative study how participants perceived existing PHWs on WTPs, assessed how they interpreted novel plain packaging of WT featuring enhanced PHWs, and probed perceptions of how existing and novel sets would affect uptake or cessation of WTS. Design We conducted ten qualitative focus groups and ten in-depth interviews. We explored participants' views of the four existing PHWs (occupied 50% of the front and back of WTPs, displayed cancers, and featured colourful fruits and flavors) and four novel PHWs (occupied 80% of the front and back of WTPs, displayed different topical content, with plain packaging). Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Setting Rural Menoufia, urban and semi-urban Cairo, Egypt. Participants 90 waterpipe smokers and non-smokers, men and women, aged 18 years or older. Outcomes Perceived potential effect on WTS uptake or cessation, probing factors related to PHW content and WTP design. Results Participants in focus groups and in-depth interviews thought existing WT PHWs elicited affective responses, but found them unclear or unrealistic and thought the colourful packaging detracted from the warnings. In contrast, they thought novel and larger WT PHWs presented in plain packaging might prevent WTS initiation or trigger quit attempts. Participants regarded warnings featuring proximal health risks as most likely to be acceptable. Conclusions Our exploratory study suggests larger WT PHWs featuring proximal risks and presented on plain WTPs could potentially deter experimentation with WT products among non-users and promote cessation among existing users. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

Little is published about monitoring this systemic autoimmune DED. We analyzed the SS related DED tests used in North American optometric practices and compared academic settings to private practice settings. Methods: A retrospective chart review of 123 SS charts from 6 optometric practices in North America was conducted. Testing done during the first examination following a SS diagnosis was recorded on Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. The complete data file was reviewed and testing type and methodology were compared. Results: Symptoms of DED (98.4% of charts),meibomian gland dysfunction (76.4% of charts), corneal staining with fluorescein (75.6% of charts) and anterior blepharitis (73.2% of charts) were the most frequently recorded variables. Clinicians used different methodologies to measure and grade these variables.

In this population, dose selection to achieve safe and effective drug exposure is difficult. We developed a novel and flexible approach that uses physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to translate results from ECMO ex vivo experiments into bedside dosing recommendations. To determine fluconazole dosing in children on ECMO, we developed a PBPK model, which was validated using fluconazole pharmacokinetic (PK) data in adults and critically ill infants. Next, an ECMO compartment was added to the PBPK model and parameterized using data from a previously published ex vivo study. Simulations using the final ECMO PBPK model reasonably characterized observed PK data in infants on ECMO, and the model was used to derive dosing in children on ECMO across the pediatric age spectrum. This approach can be generalized to other forms of extracorporeal life support (ECLS), such as dialysis. © 2018 The Authors CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.",,fluconazole; Article; AUC (0-24 h); candidiasis; child; clearance; clinical trial (topic); dialysis; drug degradation; drug disposition; drug dose regimen; drug exposure; drug interaction; extracorporeal oxygenation; glomerulus filtration rate; human; in vitro study; infant; lipophilicity; long term care; mathematical model; molecular weight; pharmacokinetics; physical chemistry; priority journal; risk factor; treatment failure,,American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics,21638306,,,30033691,English,CPT Pharmacometrics Syst.

Influencing factors include: technological and management changes at farm level and along the value chain resulting in greater production efficiencies and improved life cycle resource efficiency and environmental performance; a changing policy/regulatory environment; and shifts in societal expectations and associated market dynamics, including increased attention to animal welfare outcomes-especially in regard to changes in housing systems for laying hens. In the face of this change, effective decision-making is needed to ensure the sustainability of the Canadian egg industry. Attention both to lessons from the past and to the emerging challenges that will shape its future is required and multi- and interdisciplinary perspectives are needed to understand synergies and potential trade-offs between alternative courses of action across multiple aspects of sustainability. Here, we consider the past, present and potential futures for this industry through the lenses of environmental, institutional (i.e., regulatory), and socio-economic sustainability, with an emphasis on animal welfare as an important emergent social consideration.

Within the centralized approach, a system-wide optimization technique is firstly utilized to estimate the overall optimal net benefits when the water demand management initiatives are implemented. Cooperative game-theoretic methods are used to fairly redistribute the additional net benefits. In terms of the decentralized perspective, an agent-based modelling framework is adopted to permit each user to make independent decisions on whether to conserve water or consume extra water and how much to conserve or consume by solving individual optimization problems. For comparison purposes, both the centralized and decentralized approaches are applied to a case study reflecting an actual situation in the South Saskatchewan River basin in Alberta, Canada. Both methods provide positive incentives to encourage users to conserve water while maintaining at least the same level of economic benefits such that system-wide productivity is improved. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the centralized method produces greater overall net benefits, but the users may be less motivated to participate. © 2018 by the authors.",Agent-based modelling; Bargaining; Centralized and decentralized perspectives; Cooperative game; Net benefits; Optimization; Water demand management,,,MDPI AG,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054052714,

The primary molecular-based approach for solving this problem has been the reaction ensemble Monte Carlo (REMC) algorithm [ Turner et al. Molec. Simulation 2008, 34, (2), 119-146 ], based on classical force-field methodology. In spite of the vast improvements in computer hardware and software since its original development almost 25 years ago, its more widespread application is impeded by its computational inefficiency. A fundamental problem is that its MC basis inhibits the implementation of significant parallelization, and its successful implementation often requires system-specific tailoring and the incorporation of special MC approaches such as replica exchange, expanded ensemble, umbrella sampling, configurational bias, and continuous fractional component methodologies. We describe herein a novel CRE algorithm (reaction ensemble molecular dynamics, ReMD) that exploits modern computer hardware and software capabilities, and which can be straightforwardly implemented for systems of arbitrary size and complexity by exploiting the parallel computing methodology incorporated within many MD software packages (herein, we use GROMACS for illustrative purposes). The ReMD algorithm utilizes these features in the context of a macroscopically inspired and generally applicable free energy minimization approach based on the iterative approximation of the system Gibbs free energy function by a mathematically simple convex ideal solution model using the composition at each iteration as a reference state. Finally, we additionally describe a simple and computationally efficient a posteriori method to estimate the equilibrium concentrations of species present in very small amounts relative to others in the primary calculation. To demonstrate the algorithm, we show its application to two classic example systems considered previously in the literature: the N 2 -O 2 -NO system and the ammonia synthesis system. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,Ammonia; Application programs; Approximation algorithms; Computational efficiency; Computer hardware; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Hardware; Molecular dynamics; Molecular structure; Molecular weight; Problem solving; Reaction kinetics; Ammonia synthesis system; Classical force fields; Computationally efficient; Equilibrium concentration; Free energy minimization; Hardware and software; Iterative approximations; Molecular simulations; Iterative methods,,American Chemical Society,23747943,,,,English,ACS Cent.

Rising sea levels, sinking coasts, and changing precipitation patterns modify hydrodynamic gradients and may enhance sea-land exchange processes in both tidal and non-tidal systems. Furthermore, the removal of flood protection structures as restoration measure contributes locally to the changing coastlines. A detailed understanding of the ecosystem functioning of coastal zones and the interactions between connected terrestrial and marine ecosystems is still lacking. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary approach to the investigation of interactions between land and sea at shallow coasts, and discuss the advantages and the first results provided by this approach as applied by the research training group Baltic TRANSCOAST. A low-lying fen peat site including the offshore shallow sea area on the southern Baltic Sea coast has been chosen as a model system to quantify hydrophysical, biogeochemical, sedimentological, and biological processes across the land-sea interface. Recently introduced rewetting measures might have enhanced submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) as indicated by distinct patterns of salinity gradients in the near shore sediments, making the coastal waters in front of the study site a mixing zone of fresh- and brackish water. High nutrient loadings, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) originating from the degraded peat may affect micro- and macro-phytobenthos, with the impact propagating to higher trophic levels. The terrestrial part of the study site is subject to periodic brackish water intrusion caused by occasional flooding, which has altered the hydraulic and biogeochemical properties of the prevailing peat soils. The stable salinity distribution in the main part of the peatland reveals the legacy of flooding events. Generally, elevated sulfate concentrations are assumed to influence greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, mainly by inhibiting methane production, yet our investigations indicate complex interactions between the different biogeochemical element cycles (e.g., carbon and sulfur) caused by connected hydrological pathways. In conclusion, sea-land interactions are far reaching, occurring on either side of the interface, and can only be understood when both long-term and event-based patterns and different spatial scales are taken into account in interdisciplinary research that involves marine and terrestrial expertise. © 2018 Jurasinski, Janssen, Voss, Bцttcher, Brede, Burchard, Forster, Gosch, Grдwe, Grьndling-Pfaff, Haider, Ibenthal, Karow, Karsten, Kreuzburg, Lange, Leinweber, Massmann, Ptak, Rezanezhad, Rehder, Romoth, Schade, Schubert, Schulz-Vogt, Sokolova, Strehse, Unger, Westphal and Lennartz.",Coastal peatland; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land-sea coupling; Shallow coast; Submarine groundwater discharge,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,22967745,,,,English,Front.

Forming limit experiments using limiting dome height (LDH) specimens were performed under plane-strain loading conditions using a 100 mm hemispherical Nakazima punch. Strains were measured using in situ stereoscopic digital image correlation (DIC). Two forming processing routes were examined: (i) an intermediate quench and form (IQF) processing route in which the LDH coupons were solutionized, quenched to a preset temperature, and isothermally formed and (ii) a die-quench (DQ) process where the LDH coupons were solutionized, and quenched and formed simultaneously with room temperature (RT) tooling under non-isothermal conditions. The DQ processing route was devised to understand the formability of the alloy under practical die-quenching conditions, while the IQF route was meant to understand the influence of temperature on the formability of the material. The DQ processing route exhibited the best formability from a localization standpoint; however, it was found that at deformations in excess of 0.5 major true strain, an orange-peel defect was present. The IQF process with room temperature tooling may be comparable to a W-temper forming operation. For these conditions, significant Portevin-Le-Chatelier (PLC) bands were present and the formability was approximately 75% less than for the DQ process.

Various types of specimen geometries were fabricated in different orientations with respect to the rolling direction of the sheet to reveal the anisotropic fracture response of the alloy under proportional loading conditions. To visualize directional dependency of the fracture response, experimental fracture loci for different orientations were constructed. Furthermore, non-proportional tests were performed by abrupt changes of stress states to study the role of the loading history on fracture behaviour of the alloy. The non-proportional tests entailed pre-straining the material in uniaxial and equi-biaxial tension up to a prescribed deformation level, followed by extreme changes of stress states to plane-strain tension or shear. Based on the results of the proportional and non-proportional tests, the validity of employing ""damage indicator"" approaches commonly utilized in phenomenological modelling of fracture is assessed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Damage detection; Deep drawing; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Magnesium printing plates; Rare earths; Rolling; Strain; Stress analysis; Anisotropic fractures; Fracture behaviour; Fracture characterization; Magnesium alloy sheets; Nonproportional loading; Plane strain tension; Proportional loading; Quasi-static conditions; Magnesium alloys,Butcher C.Worswick M.Bardelcik A.,Institute of Physics Publishing,17578981,,,,English,IOP Conf.

This paper evaluates three such models using austenite phase fractions derived from Vickers hardness measurements made on Al-Si coated 22MnB5 coupons heated within lab-scale muffle furnace and then water-quenched. Overall, predicted trends are in good agreement with the experimental results at different soak temperatures, but experimental trends with increasing soak times are less obvious.

The limited room temperature formability of these alloys can be overcome through elevated temperature forming while controlling heat exposure to prevent changes to the microstructure such as over-aging. The present work details a comprehensive characterization of a developmental alloy, 7xxx-T76, for non-isothermal warm forming of a cylindrical deep drawn cup. Material anisotropy and a non-associated constitutive model were developed with the hardening response as a function of temperature and strain-rate. Friction was characterized at elevated temperature using a Warm Twist Compression Test apparatus developed at the University of Waterloo. Significant material anisotropy was observed in the tensile characterization results and during warm forming with the formation of eight ears in the deep drawn cups for a drawing ratio of 2.25.

Being a relatively new technology, adopting the DQ process into automotive assembly lines involved several challenges. One of these challenges is the constitutive modelling, which is being addressed in literature. Another challenge is determining the proper formability conditions for DQ to work. To this end, the work presented herein investigated different forming parameters required to successfully deep draw AA7075 discs. Two disc sizes were selected: 177.8 and 203.3 mm. Parameters that were investigated were: binder load and lubricant applied. The deep draw experiments were also modelled in the LS-Dyna finite element code, using the constitutive data and a Barlat-2000 yield surface developed in other work by the authors. The predicted deep draw curves were found to match well the experimental data.

Due to the strain-rate sensitivity of magnesium alloys at elevated temperature, it was important to ensure that the strain-rate remained reasonably constant during the bulge test. Various gas pressure versus time profiles were used to achieve strain-rates in the range of 0.01 s-1 to 0.1 s-1. The results from equi-biaxial bulge testing will be detailed in addition to bulge testing performed using elliptical dies with various aspect ratios to generate data under different biaxial stretching conditions. Supplementary characterization was provided using shear specimen data and tension test data from the rolling and transverse directions of the sheet. The biaxial, tensile, and shear data was used to calibrate a linear transformation-based anisotropic yield function at 200 °C. The yield function coefficients were optimized by matching the surface displacement data between experiments and finite element simulations of the bulge test. Agreement of the surface displacement data for a given applied pressure ensured that both the stress and strain in the bulged dome were accurately captured.

Both isothermal and non-isothermal experiments are performed with a draw ratio of 2.25. Warm temperature formability of ZEK100 is investigated through determination of draw depths of cylindrical cups under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. The effect of sheet anisotropy during deep drawing operation is investigated by measuring the earring profiles by means of digital imaging as well as sheet thickness from the center to the outer diameter in the rolling direction.

Temperature process windows are used to present a direct comparison of forming behavior between ZEK100 and AZ31B. The increased forming performance of ZEK100 at elevated temperatures is attributed to the weakened texture resulting from alloying with Zr and Nd, respectively, allowing for elevated slip activity at lower temperatures. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Drawing (forming); Isotherms; Magnesium alloys; Magnesium printing plates; Rare earths; Slip forming; Cylindrical punches; Drawing performance; Elevated temperature; Forming performance; Lower temperatures; Magnesium-rare earths; Non-isothermal condition; Wrought magnesium alloys; Deep drawing,Butcher C.Worswick M.Bardelcik A.,Institute of Physics Publishing,17578981,,,,English,IOP Conf.

A physics based transformation model is implemented into the crystal plasticity framework to fully capture the behavior of TRIP assisted steels.

In this work, numerical simulation is used to investigate the crush response of a Usibor® 1500-AS axial crush rail with tailored properties achieved using in-die heated (IDH) hot stamping. In this case, the targeted properties in the softened zone correspond to a tensile strength of 1000 MPa. A finite element model is utilized to predict the crash performance of the tailored in-die heated 1000 MPa crush tip within a Usibor® 1500-AS rail. A numerical parametric study is presented, comparing the crush response based on fracture loci determined using two different plane-strain strain experiments, one the plane-strain Nakazima dome test and the other the VDA-238 V-bending test. In addition a number of different mesh regularization treatments are considered. The predictions exhibit a strong dependency of the onset of fracture upon the plane strain fracture strain level and degree of mesh regularization. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Deep drawing; Forging machines; Fracture; Mesh generation; Strain; Tensile strength; Axial crushes; Crash performance; Crush response; Different planes; Fracture locus; Front-end structures; Numerical parametric studies; Tailored properties; Stamping,Butcher C.Worswick M.Bardelcik A.,Institute of Physics Publishing,17578981,,,,English,IOP Conf.

To acquire highly efficient and relatively accurate mapping for large-scale GPS/GNSS-denied scene, we present an upgraded backpacked laser scanning system and a car-mounted indoor mobile laser scanning system. The systems provide both 3D laser scanning point cloud and camera images. In this paper, a simultaneous extrinsic calibration approach for multiple multi-beam LIDAR and multiple cameras is also proposed using the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)-based algorithm. The proposed approach uses the SLAM-based algorithm to achieve a large calibration scene using mobile platforms, registers an acquired multi-beam LIDAR point cloud to the terrestrial LIDAR point cloud to acquire denser points for corner feature extraction, and finally achieves simultaneous calibration. With the proposed mapping and calibration algorithms, we can provide centimetre-lever coloured point cloud with relatively high efficiency and accuracy. © Authors 2018.

Our calculation is facilitated by the fact that the null boundaries of the Wheeler-DeWitt patch do not contribute at late times and essential contributions coming from the joints are now understood. The late time growth rate reduces to a difference of internal energies associated with the inner and outer horizons, and in the limit where the mass is much larger than the charge, we reproduce the celebrated result of 2M/? with corrections proportional to the highest Lovelock coupling in even (boundary) dimensions. We find in some cases a minimum mass below which complexity remains effectively constant, even if the black hole contains a nondegenerate horizon. © 2018 authors.

The electrode-tissue contacts remain one of the major obstacles of neural prostheses microstructure. Recently, Microelectrode fabrication techniques have been developed to have a long-term and stable interface with the brain. In this paper, a comparative analysis of finite element models (FEM) for several electrode layouts is conducted. FEM involves parametric and sensitivity analysis to show the effects of the different design parameters on the electrode mechanical performance. These parameters include electrode dimensions, geometry, and materials. The electrodes mechanical performance is evaluated with various analysis techniques including: linear buckling analysis, stationary analysis with axial and shear loading, and failure analysis for brittle and ductile materials. Finally, a novel figure of merit (FOM) is presented and dedicated to the various electrodes prototypes. The proposed designs take into account mechanical performance, fabrication cost, and cross sectional area of the electrode. The FOM provides important design insights to help the electrodes designers to select the best electrode design parameters that meet their design constraints. © 2018 The Author(s).",Buckling analysis; Finite element model; FOM; Microelectrode; Stationary analysis,Microelectrodes; Neural prostheses; Prosthetics; Sensitivity analysis; Surgery; Buckling analysis; Deep brain stimulation; Design and implementations; Figure of merit (FOM); Linear buckling analysis; Mechanical performance; Microelectrode fabrication; Stationary analysis; Finite element method; alloy; copper; nickel; polyamide; silicon; biomechanics; comparative study; cost; cross-sectional area; density; device failure analysis; equipment design; finite element analysis; geometry; linear buckling analysis; measurement; novel figure of merit; parametric test; performance; physical parameters; Poison ratio; priority journal; Review; sensitivity analysis; shear strength; Young modulus; brain depth stimulation; devices; economics; electrode; mechanics; Costs and Cost Analysis; Deep Brain Stimulation; Electrodes; Equipment Design; Mechanical Phenomena; Shear Strength,,BioMed Central Ltd.,1475925X,,BEOIB,30227862,English,Biomed.

Our study develops allometric equations for three dominant genera found in boreal fens: Alnus spp. (alder), Salix spp. (willow) and Betula pumila (bog birch). Two different types of local equations were developed: (1) individual equations based on genus/phylogeny, and (2) a general equation that pooled all individuals regardless of genera. The general equation had a R2 = 0.97 (n = 82), and was not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05) than any of the phylogenetic equations. This indicated that a single generalized equation is sufficient in estimating AGB for all three genera occurring in our study area. A closer look at the performance of the general equation revealed that smaller stems were predicted less accurately than larger stems because of the higher variability of leafy biomass found in small individuals. Previously published equations developed in other ecoregions did not perform as well as our local equations. © 2018 by the authors.",Allometric equations; Allometry; Biomass; Biometry; Carbon; Peatlands; Shrubs; Wetlands,Biology; Biomass; Carbon; Allometric equations; Allometry; Biometry; Peat land; Shrubs; Wetlands; aboveground biomass; allometry; biomass; estimation method; phylogeny; shrub; Biology; Biomass; Biometrics; Carbon; Shrubs; Wetlands; Alnus; Betula pumila; Salix,,MDPI AG,19994907,,,,English,Forests,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053635701,

A class of cationic membrane lytic peptides has shown potential as an anticancer agent by inducing cancer cell death via membrane disruption; meanwhile, their intrinsic selectivity renders them as having low cytotoxicity towards noncancerous cells. Here, we report the use of a cationic peptide amphiphile (PA), named PAH6, to load doxorubicin (Dox) that is intercalated in an ATP-binding aptamer-incorporated DNA scaffold. The PA contains a cationic lytic sequence, (KLAKLAK) 2 , a polyhistidine segment for the “proton sponge” effect, and a hydrophobic alkyl tail to drive the self-assembly. Dox-loaded DNA was found to form a spherical nanocomplex (NC) with PAH6 with particle sizes below 100 nm at various ratios. Since the carrier PAH6 is also a therapeutic agent, the drug loadings of the NC reached up to ~86% within the ratios we tested, and Dox was released from the NC in an ATP-rich environment. In vitro studies indicate that the presence of PAH6 could permeabilize cell membranes and kill cells through fast membrane disruption and depolarization of mitochondrial membranes. The cytotoxicity tests were conducted using A549 nonsmall cell lung cancer cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells. PAH6 showed selectivity towards A549 cells. Significantly, the Dox-DNA/PAH6 NC exhibited a synergistic effect against A549 cells, with the IC50 decreased up to ~90% for Dox and ~69% for PAH6 when compared to the IC50 values of the two components, respectively. Furthermore, the selectivity of PAH6 conferred to the complex an improved therapeutic index between A549 and NIH-3T3 cells. A 3D-cultured A549 spheroid model was adopted to test the capability of Dox-DNA/PAH6 for tumor penetration. The PAH6 or Dox-DNA/PAH6 complex was found to break the spheroids into pieces, while Dox-treated spheroids maintained their shapes. In summary, this work provides a new strategy for constructing nanomedicines using therapeutic agents to meet the features required by anticancer treatment. © 2018 by the authors.

And what underlying factors influence this shift? Insights are identified from a qualitative analysis of a 3-year residential smart grid project in a suburb of Toronto, Canada. Interviews evaluated whether participants experienced changes in their energy culture and identified underlying factors. In particular, the impacts of the project tools on participants' norms (attitudes and awareness towards energy management), material culture (technical changes) and energy practices (conservation/peak shifting actions) were assessed, and motivations and barriers towards energy management were identified. The effectiveness of engagement mechanisms (i.e., web portal, reminder emails, webinars, incentivized control programme, and weekly electricity reports) was also evaluated. By examining detailed qualitative feedback following a multi-year suburban smart grid project in Ontario this study aims to (1) assess the changes in energy culture over the duration of the 3-year project and to (2) assess the underlying factors influencing household energy consumption and asmart residentialenergy culture. Results: Findings from the interview were compared to the results of an initial project survey to identify longer-term influences on energy culture. Increases in self-reported awareness and practices were accounted for, with the web portal and individualized weekly feedback email reported most frequently as causes of change. While increased awareness was obtained, participants needed additional guidance to make substantial changes. Although participants were financially motivated, norms of lifestyle and convenience, as well as competing household values of energy management were the largest barriers to home energy management. Conclusions: This study showcases challenges for engaging homeowners with home energy management technologies due to norms as well as competing household interests. Nuanced findings as an outcome of this study framed around energy cultures can influence future studies on smart grid engagement and consumer behaviour with larger samples sizes. In particular, future studies can further investigate the motivations and barriers surrounding residential energy cultures, how to engage different 'cultures of consumption' within households, and elements to effectively educate consumers beyond disaggregated feedback. © 2018 The Author(s).",Conservation and demand management (CDM); Demand-side management (DSM); Energy cultures; Feedback; Household engagement; Smart grid; Time of use (TOU) pricing,Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electronic mail; Energy management; Energy utilization; Feedback; Housing; Motivation; Portals; Demand Side Management (DSM); Energy cultures; Household engagement; Smart grid; Time-of-use pricing; Smart power grids; alternative energy; consumption behavior; fuel consumption; household energy; household survey; material culture; participatory approach; qualitative analysis; questionnaire survey; residential energy; smart grid; sustainability; technological change; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto,,BioMed Central Ltd.,21920567,,,,English,Energy Sustainability Soc.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053263810,

Our objective was to examine variation in the associations between frailty and select 1-year health outcomes by caregiver distress and client sex among community-residing older care recipients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked population-based clinical and health administrative databases for all long-stay home care clients (n = 234,552) aged 66+ years assessed during April 2010-2013 in Ontario, Canada. Frailty was assessed using a previously validated 72-item frailty index (FI). Presence of caregiver distress was derived from clinical assessment items administered by trained home care assessors. Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to examine variations in the associations between frailty and outcomes of interest (mortality, nursing home [NH] placement, all-cause and prolonged hospitalization) by caregiver distress, with further model stratification by client sex. Results: Frailty prevalence varied little by sex (19.3% women, 19.9% men) despite significant sex-differences in clients' sociodemographic and health characteristics. In both sexes, frailty was significantly associated with all outcomes, particularly NH placement (RR = 3.84, 95%CI 3.75-3.93) and death (RR = 2.32, 95%CI 2.27-2.37), though risk ratios were greater for women. Caregiver distress was more common with increasing frailty and for male clients, and a significant independent predictor of NH placement and prolonged hospitalization in both sexes. The association between frailty and NH placement (but not other outcomes) varied by caregiver distress for both men and women (p < 0.001 interaction terms), showing a greater magnitude of association among clients without (vs. with) a distressed caregiver. Conclusions: As caregiver distress varies by client sex, represents a key driver of NH placement (even among relatively robust clients), and modifies the impact of other risk factors such as frailty, it should be routinely assessed. Further, sex-differences should be considered when developing and evaluating community-based services for older adults and their caregivers. © 2018 The Author(s).",Caregiver distress; Frailty; Gender; Home care; Hospitalization; Mortality; Nursing home; Retrospective cohort; Sex,,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712318,,,30208884,English,BMC Geriatr.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053224003,

Gravitational wave strain waveforms are extracted directly from the data using a filtering method that exploits the observed or expected time-dependent frequency content. Statistical analysis of residual noise, after filtering out spectral peaks (and considering finite bandwidth), shows no evidence of non-Gaussian behaviour. There is also no evidence of anomalous causal correlation between noise signals at the Hanford and Livingston sites. The extracted waveforms are consistent with black hole coalescence template waveforms provided by LIGO. Simulated events, with known signals injected into real noise, are used to determine uncertainties due to residual noise and demonstrate that our results are unbiased. Conceptual and numerical differences between our RMS signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and the published matched-filter detection SNRs are discussed. © 2018 The Authors",Black hole coalescence; Gravitational waves; Signal extraction,,,Elsevier B.V.,3702693,,PYLBA,,English,Phys Lett Sect B Nucl Elem Part High-Energy Phys,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052150142,

Thus, building faзades must be rapidly inspected to prevent potential loss of life and property damage. Harnessing the capacity to use new vision sensors and associated sensing platforms, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would expedite this process and alleviate spatial and temporal limitations typically associated with human-based inspection in high-rise buildings. In this paper, we have developed an approach to perform rapid and accurate visual inspection of building faзades using images collected from UAVs. An orthophoto corresponding to any reasonably flat region on the building (e.g., a faзade or building side) is automatically constructed using a structure-from-motion (SfM) technique, followed by image stitching and blending. Based on the geometric relationship between the collected images and the constructed orthophoto, high-resolution region-of-interest are automatically extracted from the collected images, enabling efficient visual inspection. We successfully demonstrate the capabilities of the technique using an abandoned building of which a faзade has damaged building components (e.g., window panes or external drainage pipes). © 2018 by the authors.

A miniature sized shear specimen was used in this work to perform high strain rate shear testing. Digital image correlation (DIC) techniques were employed to measure the strains in the experiments. At maximum in-plane shear strains greater than 20%, the AA7075-T6 alloy demonstrated a reduced work hardening rate at elevated strain rates. At lower strains, the AA7075-T6 alloy showed mild positive rate sensitivity. The strain to localization (using the Zener-Holloman criterion), measured using the DIC technique, decreased with strain rate in shear loading. The strain at complete failure, however, exhibited an increase at the highest strain rate (500 s-1). The current work also focused on characterization of the thermal conditions occurring during high rate loading in shear with in situ high speed thermal imaging. Experimental results from the highest strain rate (500 s-1) tests showed a notable increase in temperature within the specimen gauge region as a result of the conversion of plastic deformation energy into heat. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,,Cosculluela A.Cadoni E.Buzaud E.Couque H.,EDP Sciences,21016275,9.78276E+12,,,English,EPJ Web Conf.,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053699965,

Their increased strength allows for the reduction of sheet thickness, and thus a reduction in mass, while offering formability and cost advantages when compared to other metal alloys typically considered for lightweight applications. DP980 steels are AHSS being considered for structural energy absorbing components; however, there is a lack of published information on their high rate behaviour. This paper presents the results of an experimental program that characterized three production DP980 steels from three different manufacturers at strain rates of 0.001, 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 s-1. An electro-mechanical frame was used for the quasi-static tests, the 1, 10, and 100 s-1 tests were carried out using a fast hydraulic apparatus and the 1,000 s-1 experiments were carried out using a tensile split Hopkinson bar. The quasi-static hardening response at strains higher than the uniform elongation of about 7% was obtained by using a shear test, thus avoiding the use of inverse modelling techniques. The results indicate that the DP980 steels are moderately rate sensitive, with one of the materials showing higher sensitivity than the others. One of the materials exhibited a yield point phenomenon that appears to affect the behaviour of the material at 100 and 1,000 s-1, however, the reasons for this behaviour remain an open question. The data was fit to modified Johnson-Cook and Cowper-Symonds model to account for rate sensitivity. The results presented in this paper provide a tool for modelling the dynamic behaviour of DP980 steels. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,,Cosculluela A.Cadoni E.Buzaud E.Couque H.,EDP Sciences,21016275,9.78276E+12,,,English,EPJ Web Conf.,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053701347,

Surface rollers are shaped on the flow surface due to submerged hydraulic jump or any obstacles in the forced poolriffle units. Corner rollers are shaped close to the corners near the walls at the pool head. Ramp rollers are formed at the bed of the channel on the ramp into the head of the pool. All kinds of vortices stretch in the streamwise direction as they travel to the downstream, which they are called axial tails. The simulations showed that all four types of vortices interact with each other, combine, amplify or cancel out each other as they travel downstream. The strength of vortices and how they interact result into different types of flow patterns. The surface rollers combine with corner rollers to make a jet like plunging flow near the pool bed. In other cases with lower riffle heights, ramp rollers tend to push the flow up, which in turn leads to higher turbulence near the bed and higher velocity near the flow surface (skimming flow). Moreover, if both surface rollers and ramp rollers have the similar strength (e.g., vorticity) and scale, the streamwise velocity profile has a peak around the middle of the flow, and minimum velocities near the bed and free surface. This flow pattern was named as rifting flow. Based on these findings, a new hypothesis is proposed called 'vortex-resistance,' which states that the turbulent structures, by increasing the eddy viscosity and changing the pressure domain, act as an obstacle that steers the flow. Plunging and skimming flow can thus be understood as the products of different types of turbulent structures. These findings provide new clarifications to long-standing questions related to the hydraulics of pools and riffles. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,,Paquier A.Riviere N.,EDP Sciences,22671242,,,,English,E3S Web Conf.,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053787547,

However, sediment transport rate estimates are heuristic at best to within 1 - 3 orders of magnitude. Mimico Creek is an urban gravel-bed channel in Southern Ontario, Canada that has undergone intensive event-based sediment transport sampling and inter-event bed material particle tracking over a three-year period. A HEC-RAS model was developed of the study reach and calibrated to a series of discharge events where in-situ bedload sampling occurred. Both step-wise discharge and unsteady flow simulations were evaluated to compare sediment transport rates for a range of transport models which included the Meyer-Peter Mьller and the Wilcock-Crowe. Calibration curves were developed to estimate sediment discharge in Mimico Creek. The results of the calibrated model were used to calculate the mean travel distance of bed material using the expression for the volumetric rate of bed material transport. Results from the modelling exercise found mean travel distances were similar and in some cases larger than those observed from field measurements, considering both mobile and immobile particles. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,,Paquier A.Riviere N.,EDP Sciences,22671242,,,,English,E3S Web Conf.,Conference Paper,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053815373,

We are interested in how such a neural network might emerge from a biologically plausible learning rule. Other neural network learning methods either only apply to feedforward networks, or employ assumptions (such as weight copying) that render them unlikely in a real brain. Predictive estimators (PEs) offer a better solution to this bidirectional learning scenario. However, PEs also depend on weight copying. In this paper, we propose the symmetric PE (SPE), an architecture that can learn both feedforward and feedback connection weights individually using only locally available information. We demonstrate that the SPE can learn complicated mappings without the use of weight copying. The SPE networks also show promise in deeper architectures. © 2012 IEEE.",Backpropagation; learning; neural networks; predictive estimator (PE),Backpropagation; Biological systems; Brain models; Feedback; Flow visualization; Network architecture; Neural networks; Neurons; Sensory perception; Biological system modeling; Feed-forward network; Feedback connection; Feedforward systems; learning; Learning scenarios; Neural network learning; predictive estimator (PE); Feedforward neural networks,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,2162237X,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

Pore size and their volume distribution, and surface area were characterized using BET technique to correlate pore effect and surface area on RBd. Bounds for effective thermal conductivity were determined using Lipton-Vernescu model. Variation of thermal conductance with respect to temperature was studied and compared with the results of other materials. According to EMPT, RBd in Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6/SiC composites ranged from 3.84 Ч 10-7 to 5.42 Ч 10-7 m2KW-1 and 3.36 Ч 10-7 to 3.86 Ч 10-7 m2KW-1 for Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6/Al2O3 composites. Kapitza radius (aK) for SiC samples was ranged between 2.01 - 2.84 ?m; for Al2O3 samples it was 1.86 ?m. Hasselman-Johnson model gave RBd values 55%, 51%, and 8% more than what EMPT is predicting, but of the same order and aK values 3.5 ?m, 4 ?m, 3 ?m for SiC samples and 1.2 ?m, 0.6 ?m, 0.55 ?m for Al2O3 samples. Nan-Birringer model yielded large aK of 7.25 ?m and RBd ? 1.4 Ч 10-6 m2KW-1 for Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6/SiC. So obtained parameters are reasonable estimates.

A 3.5 W continuous wave laser was used to ignite the samples in argon at atmospheric pressure, and a high speed camera captured the flame propagation. The high speed images revealed that the fast laser heating creates significant material ablation, followed by heat transfer along the heated surface. The bulk ignition occurs near the edge of the top surface, followed by the self-sustained burning. Lightly pressed powders (90% porosity) ignited in ~0.1 ms and the burning front propagated at around 200 m/s, while the dense pellets (40-60% porosity) ignited in ~1 ms and the burning front propagated at around 10 m/s. These results indicate that the reaction mechanism changes from mass convection to heat diffusion with increasing the packing density. The ignition and burn speeds of these Al/CuO nanothermites at different equivalence ratios (ERs), along with SEM images of pre- and post-combustion, illustrate that the homogeneity of the mixture is a critical parameter for optimizing the performance. The Al rich mixtures show significantly lower ignition delays and higher burn speeds. © 2018 Saceleanu, Idir, Chaumeix and Wen.",Flame propagation; Heterogeneous combustion; Laser ignition; Nanoparticle; Nanothermite reaction,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,22962646,,,,English,Front.

The microbial communities exhibit similar functional potential profiles, including chemoorganoheterotrophy as the dominant metabolism, and the potential to degrade aromatic compounds. From reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), organisms within both environments are predicted to survive in the presence of multiple antibiotics, antiseptics, biocides, and metals. Strong virulence potential coincided with the most diverse multiple resistance profiles in 1 of 5 leachate MAGs and 5 of 33 river MAGs. Unexpectedly, the microbial resistance profiles were more varied and widespread in the river populations, where we had expected the chemical composition of the leachate to select and enrich for resistance characteristics. This study provides valuable insights into the total functional potential of a landfill leachate microbial community and identifies possible human health hazards within the Duhaney River and Riverton City dump, urban environments with the potential to impact human populations. © 2018 Collins-Fairclough et al.",Antibiotic resistance; Biocide resistance; Contamination; Metagenomics; Metal resistance; Microbial diversity; Municipal solid waste; River,"antiinfective agent; disinfectant agent; metal; analysis; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; chemistry; city; classification; environmental monitoring; Jamaica; metagenomics; microbiology; phylogeny; river; waste disposal; water pollutant; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Cities; Disinfectants; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Environmental Monitoring; Jamaica; Metagenomics; Metals; Phylogeny; Refuse Disposal; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,American Society for Microbiology,23795042,,,30258036,English,mSphere,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054384526,

While the RB decay rate is known to enable estimates of the average fidelity of those operations under gate-independent Markovian noise, under gate-dependent noise this rate is more difficult to interpret rigorously. In this paper, we prove that single-qubit RB decay parameter p coincides with the decay parameter of the gate-set circuit fidelity, a novel figure of merit which characterizes the expected average fidelity over arbitrary circuits of operations from the gate-set. We also prove that, in the limit of high-fidelity single-qubit experiments, the possible alarming disconnect between the average gate fidelity and RB experimental results is simply explained by a basis mismatch between the gates and the state-preparation and measurement procedures, that is, to a unitary degree of freedom in labeling the Pauli matrices. Based on numerical evidence and physically motivated arguments, we conjecture that these results also hold for higher dimensions. © 2018 The Author(s).

To assess the effect of cathodic pH on H2O2 yield, the MEC was tested with an anion exchange membrane (AEM) and a cation exchange membrane (CEM), respectively. The maximum current density reached 0.94–0.96 A/m2 in the MEC at applied voltage of 0.35–1.9 V, regardless of membranes. The highest H2O2 conversion efficiency was only 7.2 ± 0.09% for the CEM-MEC. This low conversion would be due to further H2O2 reduction to H2O on the cathode or H2O2 decomposition in bulk liquid.

Local governments are recognizing the opportunity of this paradigm shift to improve services, create more efficient policies, and increase the wellbeing of their citizens. These new tools create the possibility for local governments to respond differently to “wicked problems” facing cities, including increasing chronic disease prevalence. Using lung and skin cancers as case studies, we present smart prevention as a novel approach that uses smart city-enabled built environment monitoring to trigger local cancer-prevention policies. First, we present results of a scoping review we conducted to describe mechanisms by which features in urban built and social environments are hypothesized to contribute to lung cancer and skin cancer. We systematically searched fourteen electronic databases, yielding 47 articles that examined associations between built and social environment features and lung cancer (n = 34), and/or built and social environment features and skin cancer (n = 13). Second, we present a narrative review of smart city theory and governance. Third, we use findings from both reviews to draw conceptual links between cancer prevention and SCC – presenting a hypothetical suite of built environment and policy interventions to prevent lung and skin cancer. © 2018 The Authors",Cancer prevention; Public policy; Scoping review; Smart cities; Urban health; Urban planning,cancer; disease control; disease prevalence; environmental monitoring; governance approach; health care; health policy; local government; smart city; urban planning; urban policy,,Elsevier Ltd,2642751,,,,English,Cities,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042869003,

Eyeblink conditioning is often used experimentally to detect abnormalities in cerebellar-dependent learning and memory that underlies this type of associative learning. While experiments in adults and older children are relatively simple to administer using commercial equipment, eyeblink conditioning in infants is more challenging due to their poor compliance, which makes correct positioning of the equipment difficult. To achieve conditioning in one-year-old infants, a custom-made or an adapted commercial system can be used to deliver the air puff to the infant's cornea. The main challenge lies in successfully detecting and classifying the behavioral responses. We report that automated blink detection methods are unreliable in this population, and that conditioning experiments should be analyzed using frame-by-frame analysis of supplementary video camera recordings. This method can be applied to study developmental changes in eyeblink conditioning and to examine whether this paradigm can detect children with neurological disorders. © 2018, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

While optical coherence tomography angiography provides an en face depiction of the choroidal vasculature, it does not reveal flow dynamics. In this report, we describe the use of plane-wave ultrasound to image and characterize choroidal blood flow. Methods: We scanned both eyes of 12 healthy subjects in a horizontal plane superior to the optic nerve head using an 18-MHz linear array. Plane-wave data were acquired over 10 transmission angles that were coherently compounded to produce 1000 images/sec for 3 seconds. These data were processed to produce a time series of power Doppler images and spectrograms depicting choroidal flow velocity. Analysis of variance was used to characterize peak systolic, and end diastolic velocities and resistive index, and their variability between scans, eyes, and subjects. Results: Power Doppler images showed distinct arterioles within a more diffuse background. Choroidal flow was moderately pulsatile, with peak systolic velocity averaging approximately 10 mm/sec and resistive index of 0.55. There was no significant difference between left and right eyes, but significant variation among subjects. Conclusions: Plane-wave ultrasound visualized individual arterioles and allowed measurement of flow over the cardiac cycle. Characterization of choroidal flow dynamics offers a novel means for assessment of the choroid’s role in ocular disease.

To determine whether attention is biased toward the nonamblyopic eye under binocular viewing conditions in adults with anisometropic or strabismic amblyopia. We first determined whether attention could be allocated preferentially to one eye in visually normal observers performing a dichoptic attentive motion tracking task. We then assessed dichoptic attentive motion tracking in amblyopia. METHODS. Participants performed a multiple-object tracking task under the following three viewing conditions: target dots to the dominant eye and distractor dots to the nondominant eye (DE condition), vice versa (NDE condition), or all dots to both eyes (binocular condition). Interocular attentional asymmetry scores were computed as the difference in accuracy between DE and NDE conditions. An interocular contrast difference favoring the amblyopic eye was used for all conditions to neutralize amblyopic eye suppression. To test for confounding effects of suppression, participants completed a separate dot enumeration task under dichoptic presentation conditions to obtain an interocular enumeration asymmetry score. RESULTS. Participants with normal vision demonstrated similar accuracy between the DE and NDE conditions and exhibited slightly impaired performance under dichoptic compared with binocular viewing conditions. Participants with strabismic/mixed amblyopia had significantly higher interocular attentional asymmetry than participants with normal vision or with anisometropic amblyopia, whereby attention was biased toward the nonamblyopic eye. The latter two groups did not exhibit a bias in interocular attention. No interocular asymmetries for the enumeration task were observed for any group. CONCLUSIONS. A nonamblyopic eye bias in the interocular allocation of attention may contribute to the binocular vision impairments caused by strabismic amblyopia. © 2018 The Authors.",Amblyopia; Binocular vision; Strabismus; Suppression; Visual attention,"accuracy; adult; amblyopia; anisometropia; Article; best corrected visual acuity; binocular vision; controlled study; depth perception; eye tracking; female; human; male; middle aged; optometry; priority journal; refraction error; strabismus; task performance; vision; visual acuity; visual stimulation; aged; amblyopia; attention; eye movement; movement perception; pathophysiology; perceptive threshold; photostimulation; physiology; statistical bias; young adult; Adult; Aged; Amblyopia; Attention; Bias; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motion Perception; Photic Stimulation; Sensory Thresholds; Strabismus; Vision, Binocular; Visual Acuity; Young Adult",,Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.,1460404,,IOVSD,30242356,English,Invest.

The potential to offset the social, economic, and personal burdens associated with such conditions depends on our ability to influence people’s thought processes, decisions, and behaviors, all of which can be understood with reference to the brain itself. Within the health neuroscience framework, the brain can be viewed as a predictor, mediator, moderator, or outcome in relation to health-related phenomena. This review explores examples of each of these, with specific reference to the primary prevention (i.e., prevention of initial onset) of chronic diseases. Within the topic of primary prevention, we touch on several cross-cutting themes (persuasive communications, delay discounting of rewards, and self-control), and place a special focus on obesity as a disorder influenced by both eating behavior and exercise habits. © 2018 New York Academy of Sciences.",Behavior; Brain; Communication; Disease; Neuroscience; Prevention; Prevention neuroscience,"brain; chronic disease; delay discounting; eating; exercise; feeding behavior; food intake; human; neurobiology; neuroimaging; neuromodulation; persuasive communication; physical activity; population health; primary prevention; prophylaxis; Review; reward; self concept; self control; association; chronic disease; forecasting; health behavior; mortality; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; pleasure; primary prevention; agents interacting with transmitter, hormone or drug receptors; Brain; Chronic Disease; Cues; Delay Discounting; Exercise; Feeding Behavior; Forecasting; Health Behavior; Humans; Neuroimaging; Neurotransmitter Agents; Obesity; Persuasive Communication; Pleasure; Primary Prevention; Reward; Self-Control",,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,778923,,ANYAA,29863790,English,Ann.

Yet, whole genome sequencing for detection of mutation clusters is prohibitive with high cost for most organisms and population surveys. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays, like the Mouse Diversity Genotyping Array, offer an alternative low-cost, screening for mutations at hundreds of thousands of loci across the genome using experimental designs that permit capture of de novo mutations in any tissue. Formal statistical tools for genome-wide detection of mutation clusters under a microarray probe sampling system are yet to be established. A challenge in the development of statistical methods is that microarray detection of mutation clusters is constrained to select SNP loci captured by probes on the array. This paper develops a Monte Carlo framework for cluster testing and assesses test statistics for capturing potential deviations from spatial randomness which are motivated by, and incorporate, the array design. While null distributions of the test statistics are established under spatial randomness via the homogeneous Poisson process, power performance of the test statistics is evaluated under postulated types of Neyman-Scott clustering processes through Monte Carlo simulation. A new statistic is developed and recommended as a screening tool for mutation cluster detection. The statistic is demonstrated to be excellent in terms of its robustness and power performance, and useful for cluster analysis in settings of missing data. The test statistic can also be generalized to any one dimensional system where every site is observed, such as DNA sequencing data. The paper illustrates how the informal graphical tools for detecting clusters may be misleading. The statistic is used for finding clusters of putative SNP differences in a mixture of different mouse genetic backgrounds and clusters of de novo SNP differences arising between tissues with development and carcinogenesis. © 2018 Luo et al.

The inversion kernel consists of a two-port transmission line forward model in the frequency domain and a constitutive material equation based on a power law soil mixture rule (Complex Refractive Index Model - CRIM). The spatially-distributed retrieval of broadband dielectric spectra was achieved with a global optimization approach based on a Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) algorithm using the full set of the scattering parameters. For each layer, the broadband dielectric spectra were retrieved with the corresponding parameters thickness, porosity, water saturation and electrical conductivity of the aqueous pore solution. For the validation of the approach, a coaxial transmission line cell measured with a network analyzer was used. The possibilities and limitations of the inverse parameter estimation were numerically analyzed in four scenarios. Expected and retrieved layer thicknesses, soil properties and broadband dielectric spectra in each scenario were in reasonable agreement. Hence, the model is suitable for an estimation of in-homogeneous material parameter distributions. Moreover, the proposed frequency domain approach allows an automatic adaptation of layer number and thickness or regular grids in time and/or space. © 2018 by the authors.

However, monitoring and enforcement problems may be overcome by encouraging resource users to develop, endorse, and subsequently enforce conservation regulations. In this article, we draw upon the literature on common-pool resources and social networks to assess the impacts of participation and network ties on the decisions of fishers to voluntarily report rule violations in two Jamaican marine reserves. Data was collected using questionnaires administered through personal interviews with fishers (n = 277). The results suggest that local fishers are more likely to report illegal fishing if they had participated in conservation planning and if they are directly linked to community-based wardens in information sharing networks. This research extends well-established findings regarding the role and impacts of participation on biodiversity conservation by highlighting the importance of synergies between participation and social networks for voluntary monitoring of conservation regulations. © 2018 The Authors.

However, the effects of inserts with such efficacy messages have not been studied using experimental designs. This study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to assess smokers' responses to efficacy inserts. METHODS In a randomized case-crossover study among smokers from the United States (n=23), participants received a one-week supply of cigarettes with efficacy inserts and a one-week supply without any inserts, and were randomized to use the packs with inserts on either the first or second week of the study. For 14 consecutive days, participants used a smartphone to answer brief surveys on cessation-related variables during smoking sessions and at the beginning of each day. Multilevel mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models compared responses during the insert period to those of the non-insert period. RESULTS The insert period was associated with greater desire to quit (b=0.21, p=0.012), motivation to quit (b=0.18, p=0.001), self-efficacy to cut down (b=0.26, p<0.001) and to quit (b=0.28, p<0.000), and response efficacy/perceived benefits of quitting (b=0.13, p=0.012). Insert exposure was not significantly associated with forgoing cigarettes (OR=1.9, p=0.2). CONCLUSIONS Results from this EMA study suggest that inserts with efficacy messages may promote determinants of smoking cessation. This is consistent with observational research in Canada, which is the only country to use inserts with efficacy messages as well as pictorial warnings about smoking risks on the outside of packs. Future studies should assess the extent to which efficacy inserts can not only be used to communicate health information to smokers but also work in synergy with pictorial warnings. © 2018 Lambert V.",Health communication; Health policy; Smoking cessation; Tobacco control,,,International Society for the Prevention of Tobacco Induced Diseases,16179625,,,,English,Tob.

They are written as integrals over the moduli space of certain rational maps localized on the (n ? 3)! solutions of the scattering equations. Due to the properties of spinor-helicity variables in six dimensions, the even-n and odd-n formulas are quite different and have to be treated separately. We first propose a manifestly supersymmetric expression for the even-n amplitudes of N= (1 1) SYM theory and perform various consistency checks. By considering soft-gluon limits of the even-n amplitudes, we deduce the form of the rational maps and the integrand for n odd. The odd-n formulas obtained in this way have a new redundancy that is intertwined with the usual SL(2, ?) invariance on the Riemann sphere. We also propose an alternative form of the formulas, analogous to the Witten-RSV formulation, and explore its relationship with the symplectic (or Lagrangian) Grassmannian. Since the amplitudes are formulated in a way that manifests double-copy properties, formulas for the six-dimensional N= (2 2) SUGRA amplitudes follow. These six-dimensional results allow us to deduce new formulas for five-dimensional SYM and SUGRA amplitudes, as well as massive amplitudes of four-dimensional N= 4 SYM on the Coulomb branch. © 2018, The Author(s).",Field Theories in Higher Dimensions; Scattering Amplitudes; Supersymmetric Gauge Theory,,,Springer Verlag,11266708,,,,English,J.

However, more limited work has addressed Neoarchean processes elsewhere in West Greenland. In particular, conflicting models have been proposed for the tectonothermal history of the Akia terrane, to the north of the Nuuk region. In this study, the depositional and metamorphic history of supracrustal rocks in the Akia terrane have been investigated using field relationships, petrography, phase equilibria modelling, and zircon and apatite U-Pb geochronology. The Akia terrane is a Palaeo- to Mesoarchean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) gneiss terrane with subordinate supracrustal rocks, mafic to ultramafic intrusions – all metamorphosed at amphibolite to granulite facies – Proterozoic mafic dyke suites, Neoproterozoic and Jurassic kimberlitic rocks, and a Mesoarchean and a Jurassic carbonatite. Some of the supracrustal rocks are known to be Mesoarchean, whilst others lack age constraint. New detrital and metamorphic zircon ages show that the metasedimentary rocks studied – the Kangerluarsuk Supracrustal Belt – were sourced from TTG gneisses within the host Akia terrane and deposited in the period ?2877 Ma to ?2857 Ma; this requires exhumation of the Akia terrane after c. 3010–2970 Ma magmatism and low-pressure granulite facies metamorphism. After exhumation, the Kangerluarsuk Supracrustal Belt was buried and underwent prolonged high-temperature metamorphism, reaching ?820–850 °C and 8–10 kbar during regional ductile deformation in the period 2857–2700 Ma. The same rocks grew metamorphic zircon and neoblastic apatite at c. 2630 Ma and >450 to <850 °C, based on U-Pb geochronology and Pb diffusion modelling respectively. This evidence of Neoarchean metamorphism of the Akia terrane shows that a large part of West Greenland was in tectonic communication and experienced common high temperature conditions in the latest Mesoarchean to early Neoarchean and by c. 2700 Ma. The recognition of prolonged Neoarchean high-temperature metamorphism and partial melting during regional ductile deformation raises questions about the veracity of textural evidence for a giant bolide impact at ?3000 Ma in the same region as such evidence would likely have been obliterated through such pervasive metamorphic and tectonic reworking. © 2018 The Authors",Apatite; Geochronology; Granulite facies; Pseudosections; Zircon,apatite; Archean; deposition; exhumation; geochronology; granulite facies; metamorphism; petrography; phase equilibrium; supracrustal rock; terrane; uranium-lead dating; zircon; Arctic; Greenland; Nuuk; West Greenland,,Elsevier B.V.,3019268,,PCBRB,,English,Precambrian Res.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048249174,

In parts of Cambodia, irrigation with groundwater results in arsenic accumulation in soils and rice, leading to health concerns associated with rice consumption. A high concentration of iron in groundwater can precipitate arsenic and reduce its bioavailability, however high concentrations of arsenic and iron can also reduce rice production. Furthermore, concerns have been raised about chemical contamination from inorganic fertilizers used to grow rice. The relationship between soil geochemistry and arsenic concentrations in rice is not yet fully understood. Objectives. The primary objective of this project was to investigate the relationship between arsenic concentrations in irrigation water, soil and rice collected from different sites in Cambodia. A secondary objective was to explore arsenic and phosphorus levels in fertilizer samples obtained from the study area in Cambodia. Methods. The present study collected 61 well water samples, 105 rice samples, 70 soil samples, 11 inorganic fertilizer samples and conducted interviews with 44 families along the Mekong River in Cambodia. Analyses for metals, total arsenic, and arsenic species in the water and rice were conducted in Canada by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Analyses for metals, total arsenic and phosphorus in soils and inorganic fertilizers were conducted in Cambodia and Singapore by X-ray fluorescence. Results. The concentration of arsenic in rice paddy soils was highly variable and as much as 20 times higher near the irrigation wells than in more distal areas of the paddy. Two farmers in Preak Russey had integrated soil samples with arsenic levels above the concentration associated with toxicity to rice in Taiwan (40 mg/kg) and above the Dutch concentration requiring intervention or remediation (55 mg/kg). The highest total arsenic measured in soil was 95 mg/kg. In Preak Russey, the loading of arsenic from irrigation water was 3710 times greater than the loading of arsenic from inorganic fertilizers. Half of the commercial inorganic fertilizers had less than 50% of the labelled content of phosphorus. Conclusions. Emphasis should be placed on improving the management of irrigation water, not on inactivation of arsenic in soil. The high levels of iron in groundwater mitigate arsenic toxicity, but the accumulation of iron could later result in lower rice productivity. Irrigation of rice with groundwater is not likely sustainable. To improve rice productivity, the content of phosphorus in local inorganic fertilizers must be improved to world standards. X-ray fluorescence analysis can quickly identify poor quality fertilizers. Informed Consent. Obtained Competing Interests.

Arsenic bioaccumulation in rice is a global concern affecting food security and public health. Objective. The present study examined arsenic species in rice in Cambodia to characterize health risks with rice consumption and to clarify uncertainties with Codex guidelines. Methods. The present study collected 61 well water samples, 105 rice samples, 70 soil samples, and conducted interviews with 44 families in Preak Russey near the Bassac River and Kandal Province along the Mekong River in Cambodia. Analyses of metals, total arsenic and arsenic species were conducted in laboratories in Canada, Cambodia and Singapore. Results. Unlike in Bangladesh, rice with the highest total arsenic concentrations in Cambodia contains mostly organic arsenic, dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), which is unregulated and much less toxic than inorganic arsenic. The present study found that storing surface runoff in ditches prior to irrigation can significantly reduce the arsenic concentration in rice. It is possible to remove > 95% of arsenic from groundwater prior to irrigation with natural reactions. Conclusions. The provision of high quality drinking water in 2015 to Preak Russey removed about 95% of the dietary inorganic arsenic exposure. The extremes in arsenic toxicity that are still obvious in these farmers should become less common. Rice from the site with the highest documented levels of arsenic in soils and water in Cambodia passes current Codex guidelines for arsenic. Informed Consent. Obtained Competing Interests.

Considering the growing problem of polypharmacy, increasing attention has been paid to how and when medication-related decisions should be coordinated across multidisciplinary care teams. Improved knowledge on how integrated electronic health records (EHRs) can support interprofessional shared decision-making for medication therapy management is necessary to continue improving patient care. Objective: The objective of our study was to examine how physicians and pharmacists understand and communicate patient-focused medication information with each other and how this knowledge can influence the design of EHRs. Methods: This study is part of a broader cross-Canada study between patients and health care providers around how medication-related decisions are made and communicated. We visited community pharmacies, team-based primary care clinics, and independent-practice family physician clinics throughout Ontario, Nova Scotia, Alberta, and Quebec. Research assistants conducted semistructured interviews with physicians and pharmacists. A modified version of the Multidisciplinary Framework Method was used to analyze the data. Results: We collected data from 19 pharmacies and 9 medical clinics and identified 6 main themes from 34 health care professionals. First, Interprofessional Shared Decision-Making was not occurring and clinicians made decisions based on their understanding of the patient. Physicians and pharmacists reported indirect Communication, incomplete Information specifically missing insight into indication and adherence, and misaligned Processes of Care that were further compounded by EHRs that are not designed to facilitate collaboration. Scope of Practice examined professional and workplace boundaries for pharmacists and physicians that were internally and externally imposed. Physicians decided on the degree of the Physician-Pharmacist Relationship, often predicated by colocation. Conclusions: We observed limited communication and collaboration between primary care providers and pharmacists when managing medications. Pharmacists were missing key information around reason for use, and physicians required accurate information around adherence. EHRs are a potential tool to help clinicians communicate information to resolve this issue. EHRs need to be designed to facilitate interprofessional medication management so that pharmacists and physicians can move beyond task-based work toward a collaborative approach. © Kathryn Mercer, Catherine Burns, Lisa Guirguis, Jessie Chin, Maman Joyce Dogba, Lisa Dolovich, Line Guйnette, Laurie Jenkins, France Lйgarй, Annette McKinnon, Josephine McMurray, Khrystine Waked, Kelly A Grindrod.

We used breeding habitat metrics, landscape attributes, and indices of grouse abundance, to compare fit between structural connectivity and genetic differentiation within five long-established Sage-Grouse Management Zones (MZ) I-V using microsatellite genotypes from 6,844 greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) collected across their 10.7 million-km2 range. We estimated structural connectivity using a circuit theory-based approach where we built resistance surfaces using thresholds dividing the landscape into “habitat” and “nonhabitat” and nodes were clusters of sage-grouse leks (where feather samples were collected using noninvasive techniques). As hypothesized, MZ-specific habitat metrics were the best predictors of differentiation. To our surprise, inclusion of grouse abundance-corrected indices did not greatly improve model fit in most MZs. Functional connectivity of breeding habitat was reduced when probability of lek occurrence dropped below 0.25 (MZs I, IV) and 0.5 (II), thresholds lower than those previously identified as required for the formation of breeding leks, which suggests that individuals are willing to travel through undesirable habitat. The individual MZ landscape results suggested terrain roughness and steepness shaped functional connectivity across all MZs. Across respective MZs, sagebrush availability (&lt;10%–30%; II, IV, V), tree canopy cover (&gt;10%; I, II, IV), and cultivation (&gt;25%; I, II, IV, V) each reduced movement beyond their respective thresholds. Model validations confirmed variation in predictive ability across MZs with top resistance surfaces better predicting gene flow than geographic distance alone, especially in cases of low and high differentiation among lek groups. The resultant resistance maps we produced spatially depict the strength and redundancy of range-wide gene flow and can help direct conservation actions to maintain and restore functional connectivity for sage-grouse. © 2018 The Authors.

Measuring cognitive function by standardized tests, however, is biased toward highly constrained environments (such as hospitals) in selected samples. Patient-powered real-world evidence using information and communication technology devices, including environmental and wearable sensors, may help to overcome these limitations. This position paper describes current and novel information and communication technology devices and algorithms to monitor behavior and function in people with prodromal and manifest stages of dementia continuously, and discusses clinical, technological, ethical, regulatory, and user-centered requirements for collecting real-world evidence in future randomized controlled trials. Challenges of data safety, quality, and privacy and regulatory requirements need to be addressed by future smart sensor technologies. When these requirements are satisfied, these technologies will provide access to truly user relevant outcomes and broader cohorts of participants than currently sampled in clinical trials. © 2018 The Authors",,algorithm; behavior change; clinical assessment; clinical research; clinical trial (topic); cognition; communication skill; computer analysis; dementia; evidence based practice; human; information and communication technology; information technology; measurement accuracy; medical ethics; medical information; outcome assessment; patient monitoring; patient safety; priority journal; privacy; prodromal symptom; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); Short Survey,,Elsevier Inc.,15525260,,,29936147,English,Alzheimer's Dementia,Short Survey,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052867258,

Their applications in biosensor development, drug delivery, and catalysis have been explored. Lanthanides and nucleotides can form interesting CPs, although most previous works have focused on a single type of metal ligand. In this work, we explored mixed nucleotides and studied their DNA adsorption properties using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) formed negatively charged CP nanoparticles with most lanthanides, and thus a salt was required to adsorb negatively charged DNA. DNA adsorption was faster and reached a higher capacity with lighter lanthanides. Desorption of pre-adsorbed DNA by inorganic phosphates, urea, proteins, surfactants, and competing DNA was successively carried out. The results suggested the importance of the DNA phosphate backbone, although hydrogen bonding and DNA bases also contributed to adsorption. The AMP CPs adsorbed DNA more strongly than the GMP ones, and using mixtures of AMP and GMP, continuous tuning of DNA adsorption affinity was achieved. Such CPs were also used as a sensor for DNA detection based on the different affinities of single- and double-stranded DNA, and a detection limit of 0.9 nM target DNA was achieved. Instead of tuning DNA adsorption by varying the length and sequence of DNA, the composition of CPs can also be controlled to achieve this goal. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,,,American Chemical Society,24701343,,,,English,ACS Omega,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051740237,

A high-dose Li-ion implantation induced the formation of electron trap centers inside the diamond grains and amorphous carbon (a-C) phases in grain boundaries for both types of NCD films. Postannealing at 1000 °C healed the defects, eliminated the electron trap centers, and converted the a-C into nanographitic phases.

However, people spend most of their time indoors, particularly in office buildings. Poor employee mental health has become one the most prevalent and costly occupational health issues. The integration of high quality environmental features (e.g., access to sunlight) in green-certified office buildings offers a superior work environment. These nature-based experiences are anticipated to provide beneficial outcomes to wellbeing. This study is the first to empirically investigate these benefits. Participants in a green (LEED gold certified) office building (N = 213) in Canada completed an assessment of environmental features, measures of hedonic, eudaimonic and negative wellbeing (NWB) and assessments of psycho-environmental potential, environmental behaviors and social belonging. Linear regression analyses confirmed the benefits of indoor environmental features for all aspects of wellbeing. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to assess the effect of specific indoor environmental features on wellbeing. We explored physical features (e.g., air quality, light), and social features (e.g., privacy), as well as windows to the outside. Results suggest that physical features are important in promoting hedonic wellbeing, while social features prevent NWB. Both features equally predicted eudaimonic wellbeing (EWB). A view to the outside was positively correlated to wellbeing, although it did not uniquely predict it after accounting for other environmental features. Path analyses revealed the importance of person-environment fit, pro-environmental behavior and social belonging in mediating the association of indoor environmental features with hedonic and EWB. The results suggests that, by fostering person-environment fit, pro-environmental behaviors and feeling of community in a high quality setting, green buildings may lead to benefits on an array of wellbeing dimensions. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. © 2018 Dreyer, Coulombe, Whitney, Riemer and Labbй.",Employee mental health; Green buildings; High-performance green buildings; Indoor environmental features; Nature exposure; Wellbeing,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,16641078,,,,English,Front.

It is present from infancy onward, and plays a role in functions from language learning to selective attention. Despite these observations, there are few data on whether statistical learning capacity changes with age or after brain injury. In order to examine how brain injury affects the ability to learn and update statistical representations, we had young control and healthy elder participants, as well as participants with either left or right brain injury, perform an auditory statistical learning task. Participants listened to two languages with made-up words that were defined by the transition probability between syllables. Following passive listening, learning was assessed with a two-alternative forced choice test for the most familiar word. As in previous studies, we found that young controls have a learning capacity limitation for statistical learning; a second language is less well learned than the first, and this statistical learning capacity limit is attenuated with age. Additionally, we found that brain damaged patients, whether with left or right hemispheric damage, showed impaired statistical learning. This impairment was not explained by aphasia or cognitive deficits. As statistical learning is a critical skill for daily life, a better appreciation of the nature of this impairment will improve our understanding of the cognitive effects of brain injury and could lead to new rehabilitation strategies. © 2018 Shaqiri, Danckert, Burnett and Anderson.",Language; Neglect; Rehabilitation; Statistical learning; Stroke,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,16625161,,,,English,Front.

The proposed filters use slotted patch microstrip resonator based on quasi fractal geometry, simulated by AWR12 software package. Both filters have quasi elliptic frequency responses, designed at centre frequency of 2.437 GHz for bandpass filter and at band frequencies of 2.434, 4.032, 4.976 and 5.638 GHz GHz respectively, for multi band bandstop filter. All filters are employed using RT/Duroid 6010.8 LM substrate of 10.8 dielectric constant and 1.27 mm dielectric thickness. Simulation results show that the designed quasi fractal bandpass filter has very narrow fractional bandwidth of 0.38 % which is very rare in microstrip filter design. On the other hand, the projected bandstop filter offers multi narrow rejection bands that is useful in broadband wireless schemes influencing from fixed interferences. Both filters present satisfactory S11 and S21 responses besides smallness properties that stand for interesting features of the newest wireless applications.

The stable isotopic results show groundwater in the basin originates from precipitation and meltwater in the mountainous areas of the Tibetan Plateau. Modern water was found in the alluvial fan and shallow aquifers of the loess plain. Deep confined groundwater was recharged by paleowater during the late Pleistocene and Holocene under a cold climate. Groundwater in the low-lying depression of the central basin is composed of paleobrines migrated from the western part of the basin due to tectonic uplift in the geological past. Groundwater chemistry is controlled by mineral dissolution (halite, gypsum, anhydrite, mirabilite), silicate weathering, cation exchange, evaporation and mineral precipitation (halite, gypsum, anhydrite, aragonite, calcite, dolomite) and varies from fresh to brine with the water types evolving from HCO3 Cl-Ca M Na to Cl-Na, Cl-K-Na and Cl-Mg type along the flow path. Groundwater flow patterns are closely related to stratigraphic control and lithological distribution. Three hierarchical groundwater flow systems, namely local, intermediate and regional, were identified using numerical modeling. The quantity of water discharge from these three systems accounts for approximately 83 14 and 3 respectively, of the total groundwater quantity of the watershed. This study can enhance the understanding of groundwater origin, circulation and evolution in the Qaidam Basin as well as other arid endorheic watersheds in northwestern China and elsewhere worldwide. © Author(s) 2018.",,Aquifers; Calcite; Chloride minerals; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Gypsum; Hierarchical systems; Hydrogeology; Ion exchange; Isotopes; Lithology; Magnesium compounds; Potassium compounds; Silicates; Sodium chloride; Stratigraphy; Watersheds; Weathering; Geochemical evolution; Groundwater chemistry; Groundwater flow systems; Groundwater origins; Mineral dissolution; Mineral precipitation; Numerical approaches; Silicate weathering; Hydrochemistry; dissolution; evaporation; flow pattern; geochemical survey; groundwater flow; hydrogeochemistry; ion exchange; mineral deposit; numerical model; silicate; water quality; watershed; weathering; China; Golmud River; Qaidam Basin; Qinghai; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau,,Copernicus GmbH,10275606,,,,English,Hydrol.

However, generic wireless sensor units, patient health and state monitoring sensors, and smart phones and watches that contain sensors can be differently oriented on the body. The vast majority of the existing algorithms are not robust against placing the sensor units at variable orientations. We propose a method that transforms the recorded motion sensor sequences invariantly to sensor unit orientation. The method is based on estimating the sensor unit orientation and representing the sensor data with respect to the Earth frame. We also calculate the sensor rotations between consecutive time samples and represent them by quaternions in the Earth frame. We incorporate our method in the pre-processing stage of the standard activity recognition scheme and provide a comparative evaluation with the existing methods based on seven state-of-the-art classifiers and a publicly available dataset. The standard system with fixed sensor unit orientations cannot handle incorrectly oriented sensors, resulting in an average accuracy reduction of 31.8%. Our method results in an accuracy drop of only 4.7% on average compared to the standard system, outperforming the existing approaches that cause an accuracy degradation between 8.4 and 18.8%. We also consider stationary and non-stationary activities separately and evaluate the performance of each method for these two groups of activities. All of the methods perform significantly better in distinguishing non-stationary activities, our method resulting in an accuracy drop of 2.1% in this case. Our method clearly surpasses the remaining methods in classifying stationary activities where some of the methods noticeably fail. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of wearable systems to make them robust against variable sensor unit orientations by transforming the sensor data at the pre-processing stage. © 2018 by the authors.

From the early Li-metal anode iterations to the current commercial Li-ion batteries (LIBs), the story of the Li-based battery is full of breakthroughs and back tracing steps. This review will discuss the main roles of material science in the development of LIBs. As LIB research progresses and the materials of interest change, different emphases on the different subdisciplines of material science are placed. Early works on LIBs focus more on solid state physics whereas near the end of the 20th century, researchers began to focus more on the morphological aspects (surface coating, porosity, size, and shape) of electrode materials. While it is easy to point out which specific cathode and anode materials are currently good candidates for the next-generation of batteries, it is difficult to explain exactly why those are chosen. In this review, for the reader a complete developmental story of LIB should be clearly drawn, along with an explanation of the reasons responsible for the various technological shifts. The review will end with a statement of caution for the current modern battery research along with a brief discussion on beyond lithium-ion battery chemistries. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here we report the development of a mechanism and the first model simulations, which can explain the formation of this MLT N 2 O layer. N 2 O production occurs primarily via a reaction route involving the excitation of N 2 from secondary electrons. Simulations using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, with external forcing from the Global Airglow model, quantitatively reproduce the observed vertical, latitudinal, and seasonal N 2 O variations. Sensitivity results indicate that photoelectrons are far more important than previously predicted, causing approximately two thirds of global N 2 O production in the MLT. Energetic electron precipitation over high latitudes provides the remaining contribution. Solar cycle analysis reveals N 2 O enhancements of up to Ч2 at solar maximum compared to solar minimum. ©2018.

The government of Vietnam has prioritized enhancing depression care through primary healthcare (PHC) and efforts are currently underway to test and scale-up psychosocial interventions throughout the country. With these initiatives in progress, it is important to understand implementation factors that might influence the successful integration of depression services into PHC. As the implementers of these new interventions, primary care providers (PHPs) are well placed to provide important insight into implementation factors affecting the integration of depression services into PHC. This mixed-methods study examines factors at the individual, organizational and structural levels that may act as barriers and facilitators to the integration of depression services into PHC in Vietnam from the perspective of PHPs. Methods: Data collection took place in Hanoi, Vietnam in 2014. We conducted semi-structured interviews with PHPs (n = 30) at commune health centres and outpatient clinics in one rural and one urban district of Hanoi. Theoretical thematic analysis was used to analyse interview data. We administered an online survey to PHPs at n = 150 randomly selected communes across Hanoi. N = 226 PHPs responded to the survey. We used descriptive statistics to describe the study variables acting as barriers and facilitators and used a chi-square test of independence to indicate statistically significant (p <.05) associations between study variables and the profession, location and gender of PHPs. Results: Individual-level barriers include low level of knowledge and familiarity with depression among PHPs. Organizational barriers include low resource availability in PHC and low managerial discretion. Barriers at the structural level include limited mental health training among all PHPs and the existing programmatic structure of PHC in Vietnam, which sets mental health apart from general services. Facilitators at the individual level include positive attitudes among PHPs towards people with depression and interest in undergoing enhanced training in depression service delivery. Conclusions: While facilitating factors at the individual level are encouraging, considerable barriers at the structural level must be addressed to ensure the successful integration of depression services into PHC in Vietnam. © 2018 The Author(s).",Depression; Global mental health; Implementation; Mixed methods; Primary care; Vietnam,"depression; female; human; integrated health care system; interview; male; organization and management; outpatient department; primary health care; qualitative research; questionnaire; rural population; urban population; Viet Nam; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Depressive Disorder; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population; Vietnam",,BioMed Central Ltd.,14726963,,,30115050,English,BMC Health Serv.

A systematic approach to selecting study areas can help ensure that an adequate range of the variables of interest is captured. We present a novel method of selecting study sites representing a larger region, in which the region is divided into subregions, which are characterized with relevant independent variables, and displayed in mathematical variable space. Potential study sites are also displayed this way, and selected to cover the range in variables present in the region. The coverage of sites is assessed with the Quality Index, which compares the range and standard deviation of variables among the sites to that of the larger region, and prioritizes sites that are well-distributed (i.e. not clumped) in variable space. We illustrate the method with a case study examining relationships between agricultural land use, physiography and stream phosphorus (P) export, in which we selected several variables representing agricultural P inputs and landscape susceptibility to P loss. A geographic area of 110,000 km2 was represented with 11 study sites with good coverage of four variables representing agricultural P inputs and transport mechanisms taken from commonly-available geospatial datasets. We use a genetic algorithm to select 11 sites with the highest possible QI and compare these, post-hoc, to our sites. This approach reduces subjectivity in site selection, considers practical constraints and easily allows for site reselection if necessary. This site selection approach can easily be adapted to different landscapes and study goals, as we provide an algorithm and computer code to reproduce our approach elsewhere. © 2018",Field studies; Optimization; Site selection; Study design,Agricultural runoff; Agriculture; Genetic algorithms; Land use; Optimization; Agricultural land use; Environmental studies; Field studies; Independent variables; Several variables; Standard deviation; Study design; Transport mechanism; Site selection; phosphorus; computer simulation; data set; genetic algorithm; numerical model; optimization; phosphorus; qualitative analysis; site selection; spatial data; agricultural land; Article; biogeographic region; case study; environmental parameters; genetic algorithm; land use; priority journal; Quality Index,,Elsevier B.V.,489697,,STEVA,,English,Sci.

A review of systematic reviews was conducted to identify gaps in the evidence on such interventions. Medline, EMBASE CINAHL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched to identify systematic reviews published in English from January 2005 to May 2017 and considering research on interventions to reduce sugar intake. Twelve systematic reviews that considered price changes, interventions to alter the food available within specific environments, and health promotion and education programs were examined. Each of the identified reviews focused on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). The existing literature provides some promising indications in terms of the potential of interventions to reduce SSB consumption among populations. However, a common thread is the limited scope of available evidence, combined with the heterogeneity of methods and measures used in existing studies, which limits conclusions that can be reached regarding the effectiveness of interventions. Reviewed studies typically had limited follow-up periods, making it difficult to assess the sustainability of effects. Further, there is a lack of studies that address the complex context within which interventions are implemented and evaluated, and little is known about the cost-effectiveness of interventions. Identified gaps speak to the need for a more holistic approach to sources of sugars beyond SSBs, consensus on measures and methods, attention to the implementation of interventions in relation to context, and careful monitoring to identify intended and unintended consequences. © 2018 by the authors.

Older adults with chronic conditions receive care from multiple providers, across multiple settings, and this care is often unorganized and confusing. In 2005, Ontario established a model of inter-professional primary care (family health teams) with the aim of providing enhanced interdisciplinary primary care to patients. Primary care requires an in-depth understanding of the operations of primary care teams and their relationships with other community services. The aim of this study was to develop a deeper understanding of the current operations of two family health teams in Ontario, including their current processes for referrals, information sharing, and engagement of patients in decision-making. Methods: Focus group and individual semi-structured interviews with health care providers were conducted. Purposeful sampling was used to ensure information was obtained from different professional perspectives. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Using NVivo 10, data were analyzed using line by line thematic analysis techniques. A cluster technique was then applied to group similar codes into themes. Results: Three focus group interviews (involving 4-6 health care providers/focus group) and six individual interviews were conducted with health care providers from two primary care teams and surrounding community care organizations. Six key themes were identified: 1) challenges engaging older adults in decisions about their care; 2) who is responsible for coordinating the care? 3) fragmented information sharing between health care providers; 4) lack of standardized referral processes and follow-up; 5) identifying services in the community for older adults; and 6) caring for older adults in rural communities. Conclusions: The results of this study provide an in-depth understanding of the current context in which the primary care teams are currently operating. Improved primary care will require stronger processes of coordination, greater knowledge of and connections with other community services, and enhanced patient engagement processes. This information provides a helpful basis for implementing interventions in primary care. © 2018 The Author(s).",Care coordination; Health care providers; Older adults; Primary care; Qualitative methods,aged; article; community care; coordination; family health; follow up; genetic transcription; health care personnel; human; Ontario; organization; patient referral; primary medical care; qualitative analysis; rural population; sampling; semi structured interview; thematic analysis,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14712296,,,30086707,English,BMC Fam.

The key objective is to utilize warm forming to form aggressive geometries and control the springback to improve the part flatness which enables the use of harder temper material with improved strength. Simulations and experiments are performed considering heated dies at several different temperatures up to 350 °C and the blanks are pre-heated in the dies. The geometry under study is referred as a surrogate heat-exchanger component (SHC) and contains complex features found on commercial automotive thermal management systems. An in-depth springback characterization was completed for a wide range of forming process parameters such as: temperature, punch load, sheet direction, and holding time. Numerical simulations were also performed to predict the springback behavior and were compared to the experiments. There were no clear results showing improvement in formability using the warm forming process. However, increased temperatures (above 250 °C) offered significant improvement in springback for the harder H24 material temper. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Although crystal plasticity can provide an accurate description of local deformation behaviour, it is often computationally expensive and usually replaced by flow rule-based phenomenological models that do not capture this phenomenon. This work presents a phenomenological-based texture evolution (PBTE) model that allows for the enhancement of flow rule-based models to capture microstructural spin in a phenomenological manner. A numerical framework is presented for generating and calibrating the microstructural evolution for the PBTE model using crystal plasticity. The PBTE Model is calibrated and employed to predict the macroscopic mechanical response and the generated microstructural spin for single crystal FCC cube during non-proportional strain paths. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

To navigate change, decision-makers can adopt culturally-sensitive interventions to address the needs of diverse stakeholders and rights holders. Calls for Indigenous flows have become important as dam operators seek to renew their legal and social licenses to operate. Knowledge pluralism is needed to enhance decision-making about flows that better address complexity and change to Indigenous livelihoods and cultural practices. However, leveraging diverse knowledge types to inform these interventions is not simply a matter of changing management practice. Power relations can constrain knowledge pluralism. We contribute an empirical example that links power in a decision-making process about a dam in Saskatchewan, Canada, to the losses experienced by downstream Indigenous communities.

The relatively low conductivity of most solid electrolytes and the often sluggish charge transfer kinetics at the interface between solid electrolyte and electrode layers are considered to be amongst the major challenges facing ASSBs. This review presents an overview of the state of the art in solid lithium and sodium ion conductors, with an emphasis on inorganic materials. The correlations between the composition, structure and conductivity of these solid electrolytes are illustrated and strategies to boost ion conductivity are proposed. In particular, the high grain boundary resistance of solid oxide electrolytes is identified as a challenge. Critical issues of solid electrolytes beyond ion conductivity are also discussed with respect to their potential problems for practical applications. The chemical and electrochemical stabilities of solid electrolytes are discussed, as are chemo-mechanical effects which have been overlooked to some extent. Furthermore, strategies to improve the practical performance of ASSBs, including optimizing the interface between solid electrolytes and electrode materials to improve stability and lower charge transfer resistance are also suggested. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Charge transfer; Electrodes; Grain boundaries; Metal ions; Potentiometric sensors; Solid state devices; All-solid state batteries; Charge transfer kinetics; Charge transfer resistance; Chemical and electrochemical stability; Grain boundary resistance; High energy densities; Sodium ion conductors; Solid oxide electrolytes; Solid electrolytes; electrochemical method; electrode; electrolyte; energy storage; grain boundary; instrumentation; ion; optimization; performance assessment,,Royal Society of Chemistry,17545692,,,,English,Energy Environ.

The school environment represents an important domain for advancing health policy among youth populations. This study examines the impact of school-based e-cigarette control policies on student e-cigarette use in the context of a natural experiment. METHODS Using three years of longitudinal student and school level data (2013/2014 to 2015/2016), from a sample of 69 secondary schools in Ontario, Canada, a generalized estimating equation approach examined the impact of school-based e-cigarette control policy changes on the prevalence of youth e-cigarette use. The main outcome of interest was current e-cigarette use, while covariates included age, gender, ethnicity, and amount of spending money in dollars per week the student has. Tests of proportion (t-tests) were used to examine whether there were any significant differences in the changes for each intervention school relative to the sample of schools that report no changes in school-level e-cigarette control policies. RESULTS Estimates from the generalized estimating equation approach suggest that students had lower odds of using e-cigarettes in schools where an e-cigarette control policy was implemented. That is, the e-cigarette control policy decreased the adjusted odds of being an e-cigarette user (OR=0.68; 95% CI: 0.48–0.97). Examining school-specific impact, at four of six schools that had an e-cigarette control policy, the ban on the use of e-cigarettes may have lowered the prevalence of e-cigarette use. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to use longitudinal data to study school-level e-cigarette use and the impact of e-cigarette control policy. These results provide new evidence that school-level policies banning the use of e-cigarettes on school property may be effective in reducing e-cigarette use (or preventing it) in their current form, as seen in this natural experiment. © 2018 Milicic S.",Electronic cigarettes; Interventional evaluation; Natural experiment; School-based policies and programs; Youth,article; controlled study; ethnicity; female; gender; high school; human; juvenile; male; money; Ontario; prevalence; student; vaping,,International Society for the Prevention of Tobacco Induced Diseases,16179625,,,,English,Tob.

We quantify the changes in the global agricultural land footprint if the world were to adhere to the dietary guidelines put forth by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), while accounting for the land use change incurred by import/export required to meet those guidelines. We analyze data at country, continental, and global levels. USDA guidelines are viewed as an improvement on the current land-intensive diet of the average American, but despite this our results show that global adherence to the guidelines would require 1 gigahectare of additional land—roughly the size of Canada–under current agricultural practice. The results also show a strong divide between Eastern and Western hemispheres, with many Western hemisphere countries showing net land sparing under a USDA guideline diet, while many Eastern hemisphere countries show net land use increase under a USDA guideline diet. We conclude that national dietary guidelines should be developed using not just health but also global land use and equity as criteria. Because global lands are a limited resource, national dietary guidelines also need to be coordinated internationally, in much the same way greenhouse gas emissions are increasingly coordinated. © 2018 Rizvi et al.

However, there has been limited research assessing the accuracy of such reports captured using novel dietary assessment tools. The purpose of the current study was to assess the validity of the web-based Automated Self-Administered 24-h Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24-Canada) for capturing dietary intake among children aged two-five years (n = 40), using parental proxy reporting. The study was conducted in a daycare setting, allowing for standardization of foods and drinks offered and direct observation of intake. Parental-reported intake was compared to true intake for lunch and dinner, as well as an afternoon snack, on a single day. Each eating occasion, including plate waste, was unobtrusively documented. Parents were not present for lunch or the afternoon snack, but joined their children at the daycare centre for the dinner meal. The following day, parents reported their children’s intake from the previous 24-h period using ASA24-Canada. For the eating occasions assessed, parents reported exact or close matches for 79.2% (82.3% for lunch, 81.2% for the snack, and 77.4% for dinner) of the foods and beverages truly consumed by children. Estimates of intake for energy and macronutrients examined (carbohydrates, fat, and protein) based on parental reports were higher than those based on true (observed) intake. Our findings suggest that parents are able to report what their preschool children eat and drink relatively accurately. However, the accuracy of portion size estimates is low. Strategies to enhance portion size reporting are needed to improve parental proxy reporting. © 2018 by the authors.

DISB is being developed within the EU Horizon 2020 project “BIOMOre” which targets a calcareous sedimentary copper ore, kupferschiefer, which is a widespread subterranean rock stratum in central and north-western Europe. Laboratory tests on the two main copper-bearing fractions of kupferschiefer, sandstone and black shale, showed that, besides requiring basic minerals to be removed ahead of indirect bioleaching (to avoid the formation of ferric carbonates), both contained significant amounts of chloride minerals (chiefly halite) which could have a major negative impact on DISB. A sequential three-phased protocol was developed, involving (i) leaching with water, which removed most of the chloride, (ii) leaching with sulfuric acid, which removed most of the residual chloride and carbonate minerals, and (iii) indirect bioleaching with an acidic ferric iron lixiviant. The latter was produced in a laboratory-scale ferric iron-generating bioreactor dominated by the iron-oxidizing acidophilic prokaryotes Leptospirillum ferriphilum, Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans and Ferroplasma acidophilum. The iron oxidizing capacity of this bioreactor was not impaired by the concentrations of chloride present during the leaching phase in which it was used. Sequential leaching was applied successfully using a “composite” (sandstone plus black shale) ore column, which mimicked the flow circuit in a DISB, and included a bleed stream where soluble copper was removed from the pregnant leach solutions generated by sulfide precipitation. Water leaching was shown to cause partial disintegration and lowering of the resistance of the sandstone fraction to crushing. © 2018 The Authors",Acid leaching; Bioreactor; Copper ore; Indirect bioleaching; Kupferschiefer; Salt,Bioconversion; Bioleaching; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Chloride minerals; Copper deposits; Copper ore treatment; Environmental impact; Iron; Oil shale; Ores; Salts; Sandstone; Shale; Sodium chloride; Sulfur compounds; Acid leaching; Copper ore; Copper sulfide ores; Kupferschiefer; Leptospirillum ferriphilum; Pregnant leach solutions; Sulfide precipitation; Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans; Copper compounds,,Elsevier B.V.,0304386X,,HYDRD,,English,Hydrometallurgy,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047791108,

This study aimed to evaluate the relative validity of a new online Beverage Frequency Questionnaire (BFQ) among young adults in Canada. Methods: A cross-sectional relative validation study was conducted among young adults aged 16-30 years (n = 50). Participants completed a 17-item BFQ, a 7-day food record (7dFR), and a single-item measure of sugary drink intake. Pearson correlations and paired t-tests were used to evaluate correlation and agreement between the measures for 17 individual beverage categories, total drink consumption, total alcoholic beverage consumption, and two definitions of drinks with excess sugars. Cognitive interviews were conducted to examine participant interpretation and comprehensiveness of the BFQ. Results: Estimates of beverage intake based on the BFQ and the 7dFR were highly correlated, specifically for the total number and volume of beverages consumed, total alcoholic beverage consumption, sugary drink intake, and each of the 17 beverage categories with 3 exceptions: coffee or tea with sugar or cream, specialty coffees, and hard alcohol with caloric mix. Paired t-tests between the BFQ and the 7dFR indicated that the average reported volume was significantly different only for sweetened fruit drinks. The single-item measure of sugary beverage intake was not significantly correlated with the 7dFR. Cognitive interviewing demonstrated high comprehension levels, and confirmed the appropriateness of the BFQ beverage categories and sizes. Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest that the BFQ performed well relative to a 7dFR and had high usability among this study population, indicating its promise for collecting population-level data on beverage intake, including sugar-sweetened beverages, which are known indicators of diet and health. © 2018 The Author(s).",Dietary assessment; Food frequency screener; Relative validity; Sugar sweetened beverages; Sugary drinks,alcohol; drinking water; accuracy; adolescent; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; beer; Beverage Frequency Questionnaire; Canada; cider; coffee; cross-sectional study; energy drink; female; fruit juice; human; interview; male; milk; nutritional assessment; nutritional status; online system; questionnaire; sports drink; sugar-sweetened beverage; tea; validity; vegetable juice; wine; young adult,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14752891,,,30068342,English,Nutr.

The results showed that (1) individual differences in response variability during the vMRT are highly reliable; (2) prior to thought probes, response variability increases with increasing depth of mind wandering; (3) response variability is highly consistent between the vMRT and the original MRT; and (4) both response variability and depth of mind wandering increase with increasing time on task. Our results indicate that the original MRT findings are consistent across the visual and auditory modalities, and that the response variability measured in both tasks indexes a non-modality-specific tendency toward behavioral variability. The vMRT will be useful in the place of the MRT in experimental contexts in which researchers’ designs require a visual-based primary task. © 2018, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",Metronome Response Task; Mind wandering; MRT; Sustained Attention; vMRT,adult; article; attention; DNA probe; female; human; human experiment; male; scientist; stimulus; thinking; validation process; attention; individuality; physiology; reaction time; task performance; validation study; young adult; Adult; Attention; Female; Humans; Individuality; Male; Reaction Time; Task Performance and Analysis; Thinking; Young Adult,,Springer New York LLC,1554351X,,,29435913,English,Behav.

Low-load resistance exercise (LLRE) counters inactivity-induced muscle atrophy in older adults, but changes in muscle fibre morphology are unstudied. We aimed to determine the impact of LLRE during short-term inactivity (step-reduction) on muscle fibre size and capillarity as well as satellite cell (SC) content in older skeletal muscle. Methods: Fourteen older (~71 years) male adults underwent 14 days of step reduction (&lt;1500 steps/day) while performing six sessions of LLRE (~30% maximal strength) with one leg (SR + EX) while the contralateral leg served as an untrained control (SR). Seven healthy ambulatory age-matched male adults (~69 years) served as a comparator group (COM). Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis after 14 days, and immunohistochemical analysis was performed to determine muscle fibre cross-sectional area (CSA), myonuclear content, SC content (PAX7+ cells), and total (C:F) and fibre type-specific (C:Fi) capillary-to-fibre ratios. Results: Type I and II fibre CSA was greater in SR + EX compared with SR. Whereas there were no differences across fibre types between SR + EX and CON, type II fibre CSA was significantly lower in SR compared with COM. Type II myonuclear domain was greater in SR + EX compared with COM and SR. Pax7+ cells associated with type I and II fibres were lower in SR compared with SR + EX. Type II PAX7+ cells were also lower in SR compared with COM with a similar trend for type I fibres. There were trends for a lower C:Fi in SR compared with SR + EX for both fibre types with no differences for each compared with COM. Conclusions: Minimal LLRE during a period of decreased physical activity is associated with greater muscle fibre CSA, SC content, and capillarization. These results support the use of LLRE as an effective countermeasure to inactivity-induced alterations in muscle morphology with age. © 2018 The Authors.

The goal of this expedition was to complete the discovery of a northwest passage by navigating the uncharted area between Barrow Strait and Simpson Strait. Franklin and his crew spent the first winter at Beechey Island, where three crewmen died and were buried. In September 1846, the ships became stranded in ice off the northwest coast of King William Island, where they remained until April 1848. At that time, the crew, reduced to 105, deserted the ships and retreated south along the island’s western and southern shores in a desperate attempt to reach the mainland and via the Back River, to obtain aid at a Hudson’s Bay Company Post. Sadly, not one individual survived. Previous analyses of bone, hair, and soft tissue samples from expedition remains found that crewmembers’ tissues contained elevated lead (Pb) levels, suggesting that Pb poisoning may have contributed to their demise; however, questions remain regarding the timing and degree of exposure and, ultimately, the extent to which the crewmembers may have been impacted. To address this historical question, we investigated three hypotheses. First, if elevated Pb exposure was experienced by the crew during the expedition, we hypothesized that those sailors who survived longer (King William Island vs. Beechey Island) would exhibit more extensive uptake of Pb in their bones and vice versa. Second, we hypothesized that Pb would be elevated in bone microstructural features forming at or near the time of death compared with older tissue. Finally, if Pb exposure played a significant role in the failure of the expedition we hypothesized that bone samples would exhibit evidence of higher and more sustained uptake of Pb than that of a contemporary comparator naval population from the 19 th century. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed bone and dental remains of crew members and compared them against samples derived from the Royal Navy cemetery in Antigua. Synchrotron-based high resolution confocal X-ray fluorescence imaging was employed to visualize Pb distribution within bone and tooth microstructures at the micro scale. The data did not support our first hypothesis as Pb distribution within the samples from the two different sites was similar. Evidence of Pb within skeletal microstructural features formed near the time of death lent support to our second hypothesis but consistent evidence of a marked elevation in Pb levels was lacking. Finally, the comparative analysis with the Antigua samples did not support the hypothesis that the Franklin sailors were exposed to an unusually high level of Pb for the time period. Taken all together our skeletal microstructural results do not support the conclusion that Pb played a pivotal role in the loss of Franklin and his crew. © 2018 Swanston et al.

This paper is drawn from a workshop held at the International Society of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2017 Annual Meeting, and highlights considerations and research priorities relevant to measuring dietary outcomes within intervention studies. Self-reported dietary data are typically relied upon in such studies, and it is recognized that these data are affected by random and systematic error. Additionally, differential error between intervention and comparison groups or pre- and post-intervention can be elicited by the intervention itself, for example, by creating greater awareness of eating or drinking occasions or the desire to appear compliant. Differential reporting can render the results of trials incorrect or inconclusive by leading to biased estimates and reduced statistical power. The development of strategies to address intervention-related biases requires developing a better understanding of the situations and population groups in which interventions are likely to elicit differential reporting and the extent of the bias. Also needed are efforts to expand the feasibility and applications of biomarkers to address intervention-related biases. In the meantime, researchers are encouraged to consider the potential for differential biases in dietary reporting in a given study, to choose tools carefully and take steps to minimize and/or measure factors such as social desirability biases that might contribute to differential reporting, and to consider the implications of differential reporting for study results. © 2018 by the authors.

However, the effectiveness of PES as an instrument to achieve these multiple objectives, in particular in a conservation-development context, is often questioned. This study adds to the very limited empirical evidence base and investigates to what extent Vietnam’s move to PES has helped protect forest ecosystems and improve local livelihoods and income inequality. We zoom in on Lam Dong province, where PES was first introduced in Vietnam in 2009. Changes in forest cover are analysed using satellite images over a period of 15 years (2000–2014). Socio-economic impacts are assessed based on rural household interviews with PES participants and non-participants as a control group over a period of 7 years (2008–2014). Our results show that PES contributes significantly to forest cover, the improvement of local livelihoods, and the reduction of income inequality. © 2018 Phan et al.

Vero cells were used as a model. The nanocomposite materials contained comb structures with equal-width trenches and lines. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy were used to image the alignment and elongation of cells. Cells were sensitive to the trench widths, and their observed behavior could be separated into three different regimes corresponding to different spreading mechanism. Cells on fine structures (trench widths of 0.21 to 0.5 ?m) formed bridges across trench openings. On larger trenches (from 1 to 10 ?m), cells formed a conformal layer matching the surface topographical features. When the trenches were larger than 10 ?m, the majority of cells spread like those on blanket tantalum films; however, a significant proportion adhered to the trench sidewalls or bottom corner junctions. Pseudopodia extending from the bulk of the cell were readily observed in this work and a minimum effective diameter of ~50 nm was determined for stable adhesion to a tantalum surface. This sized structure is consistent with the ability of pseudopodia to accommodate ~4-6 integrin molecules. © 2018 by the authors.",Adhesion; Mammalian cells; Morphology; Nanoscale; Pseudopodia; Tantalum,Adhesion; Cytology; Fluorescence microscopy; Mammals; Morphology; Nanocomposites; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicon compounds; Silicon oxides; Tantalum; Tantalum oxides; Corner junctions; Effective diameter; High-resolution scanning electron microscopies; Mammalian cells; Nano scale; Pseudopodia; Topographical features; Trench sidewalls; Cells,,MDPI AG,19961944,,,,English,Mater.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051127339,

Since the World Health Organisation recommends Civil Society Organisation's (CSO) involvement to support compliance with smoke-free laws, we explored CSOs' perceptions of law implementation in Kampala, Uganda, and the challenges and opportunities for achieving compliance. Since hospitality workers tend to have the greatest level of exposure to second-hand smoke, we focussed on implementation in respect to hospitality venues (bars/pubs and restaurants). Methods: In August 2016, three months after law implementation, we invited key Kampala-based CSOs to participate in face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Interviews probed participants' perceptions about law implementation, barriers impeding compliance, opportunities to enhance compliance, and the role of CSOs in supporting law implementation. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Qualitative content analysis was conducted using the interview transcripts. Results: Fourteen individuals, comprising mainly senior managers from CSOs, participated and reported poor compliance with the smoke-free law in hospitality venues. Respondents noted that contributing factors included low awareness of the law amongst the general public and hospitality staff, limited implementation activities due to scarce resources and lack of coordinated enforcement. Opportunities for improving compliance included capacity building for enforcement agency staff, routine monitoring, rigorous enactment of penalties, and education about the smoke-free law aimed at hospitality venue staff and the general public. Allegations of tobacco industry misinformation were said to have undermined compliance.

Evidence indicates that MI is an effective intervention for improving health behaviors as related to diet, exercise, and diabetes among adolescents. However, there is a lack of understanding about the mechanisms through which MI works and the contextual factors impacting MI effectiveness. The purpose of this review was to understand how, for whom, and under what circumstances MI works for adolescent health behavior change, which will inform future implementation of this intervention. To provide this in-depth understanding, a realist-informed systematic review was conducted in order to synthesize the evidence on the use of MI for health behaviors. Self-determination theory (SDT) was chosen as the candidate theory for testing in the present review. Methods: Databases including PsycINFO, Healthstar, Cochrane, and PubMed were searched for articles published until March 2017. The search strategy included studies that examined or reviewed the effectiveness or efficacy of MI to change health behaviors among adolescent populations. The search identified 185 abstracts, of which 28 were included in the review. The literature was synthesized qualitatively (immersion/crystallization) and tested SDT as the candidate theory. Results: Based on SDT, three mechanisms were found within reviewed studies, including competence, relatedness, and autonomy. The following contexts were found to impact mechanisms: school setting, clinician MI proficiency, parental involvement, and peer involvement. Conclusions: This realist-informed systematic review provides advances in understanding the mechanisms involved in MI for adolescent health behavior change. Additionally, it provides important practical information as to which contexts create the conditions for these mechanisms to occur, leading to health behavior change. The results can inform future MI interventions for adolescent health behavior change. Future research should continue to test this realist theory and also examine mechanism variables not extensively documented in order to improve our understanding of MI in this population. © 2018 The Author(s).",Adolescent; Health behaviors; Motivational interviewing; Realist review,adolescent; adolescent behavior; adolescent health; article; crystallization; drug efficacy; female; health behavior; human; immersion; male; Medline; motivational interviewing; PsycINFO; systematic review; theoretical study; diet; exercise; health promotion; motivational interviewing; procedures; psychology; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Adolescent Health; Diet; Exercise; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Humans; Motivational Interviewing,,BioMed Central Ltd.,20464053,,,30053903,English,Syst.

Understanding their sources is of great importance to developing appropriate river management strategies. In this study, we present an integrated sediment transport model composed of a catchment-scale hydrological model to predict river discharge, a river-hydraulics model to obtain shear stresses in the channel, a sediment-generating model, and a river sediment-transport model. We use this framework to investigate the sediment contributions from catchment and in-stream processes in the Ammer catchment close to Tьbingen in southwestern Germany. The model is calibrated to stream flow and suspended-sediment concentrations. We use the monthly mean suspended-sediment load to analyze seasonal variations of different processes. The contributions of catchment and in-stream processes to the total loads are demonstrated by model simulations under different flow conditions. The evaluation of shear stresses by the river-hydraulics model allows the identification of hotspots and hot moments of bed erosion for the main stem of the Ammer River. The results suggest that the contributions of suspended-sediment loads from urban areas and in-stream processes are higher in the summer months, while deposition has small variations with a slight increase in summer months. The sediment input from agricultural land and urban areas as well as bed and bank erosion increase with an increase in flow rates. Bed and bank erosion are negligible when flow is smaller than the corresponding thresholds of 1.5 and 2.5 times the mean discharge, respectively. The bed-erosion rate is higher during the summer months and varies along the main stem. Over the simulated time period, net sediment trapping is observed in the Ammer River. The present work is the basis to study particle-facilitated transport of pollutants in the system, helping to understand the fate and transport of sediments and sediment-bound pollutants. © 2018 Author(s).",,Catchments; Erosion; Groundwater; Hydraulics; River pollution; Rivers; Runoff; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Shear stress; Stream flow; Water quality; Facilitated transport; Fate and transport; Hydrological modeling; Seasonal variation; Sediment transport model; Stream water quality; Suspended sediment concentrations; Suspended sediment loads; Suspended sediments; agricultural land; bank erosion; catchment; hydrological modeling; river discharge; river water; sediment transport; stream; suspended sediment; Ammer River; Bavaria; Germany,,Copernicus GmbH,10275606,,,,English,Hydrol.

Individuals prone to the experience of boredom demonstrate lower levels of self-control which may be at the heart of their failures to engage in goal-directed, meaningful behaviors. Here we develop the hypothesis that distinct self-regulatory profiles, which in turn differentially influence modes of goal pursuit, are at the heart of boredom proneness. Two specific regulatory modes are addressed: Locomotion, the desire to 'just do it,' an action oriented mode of goal-pursuit, and Assessment, the desire to 'do the right thing,' an evaluative orientation toward goal pursuit. We present data from a series of seven large samples of undergraduates showing that boredom proneness is negatively correlated with Locomotion, as though getting on with things acts as a prophylactic against boredom. This 'failure to launch' that we suggest is prevalent in the highly boredom prone individual, could be due to an inability to appropriately discriminate value (i.e., everything is tarred with the same gray brush), an unwillingness to put in the required effort to engage, or simply a failure to get started. In contrast, boredom proneness was consistently positively correlated with the Assessment mode of self-regulation. We suggest that this association reflects a kind of rumination that hampers satisfying goal pursuit. © 2018 Mugon, Struk and Danckert.",Assessment; Boredom; Goal-pursuit; Locomotion; Self-regulation,,,Frontiers Media S.A.,16641078,,,,English,Front.

For the former, we compute the dependence of the CFT complexity on a boundary temporal parameter and find it to be commensurate with corresponding computations carried out in terms of the rate of change of the bulk action on a Wheeler deWitt (WDW) patch. For the latter, we compare the action/complexity relation for (d+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild AdS black holes to those of their geon counterparts, obtained via topological identification in the bulk spacetime. The complexity/action duality relation holds in both cases, but with the proportionality changed by a factor of 4, indicating sensitivity to spacetime topology. © 2018 authors.

Quantifying the condition of the reinforcing steel can help manage the human and financial risks that arise from unexpected reinforced concrete structure functional failure. Also, a quantitative time history of reinforcing steel condition can be used to make decisions on rehabilitation, decommissioning, or replacement. The self-magnetic behavior of ferromagnetic materials is useful for quantitative condition assessment. In this study, a ferromagnetic rebar with artificial defects was scanned by a three-dimensional (3D) laser scanner. The obtained point cloud was imported as a real geometry to a finite element software platform; its self-magnetic behavior was then simulated under the influence of Earth's magnetic field. The various passive magnetic parameters that can be measured were reviewed for different conditions. Statistical studies showed that 0.76% of the simulation-obtained data of the rebar surface was related to the defect locations. Additionally, acceptable coincidences were confirmed between the magnetic properties from numerical simulation and from experimental outputs, most noticeably at hole locations. © 2018 by the authors.",Defect; Magnetic flux density; Passive Magnetic Inspection (PMI); Probability paper method; Rebar; Reinforce concrete; Self-magnetic behavior,,,MDPI AG,20763417,,,,English,Appl.

The fiber laser can be tuned and switched from single-wavelength to dual-wavelength oscillation by using our recently proposed tunable comb filter. The comb filter consists of a section of multimode fiber (MMF) coiled into a polarization controller and two sections of single mode fibers (SMFs) to form a SMF/MMF/SMF structure, serving as a simple tunable all-fiber Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Due to the insertion of the MMF-based polarization controller (PC), an additional phase shift is introduced from the difference of the birefringence intensity in different dominant modes, which can be used to tune the fiber laser. In the experiment, by properly adjusting the PC, a tuning range of 9.3 nm can be achieved for the single-wavelength operation. Moreover, dual-wavelength operation with different free-spectral-ranges can be obtained.

We conducted a scoping review to characterize the state of the evidence on food insecurity and mental health among women in high-income countries. The research databases PubMed, EMBASE, and psycINFO were searched using keywords capturing food insecurity, mental health, and women. Thirty-nine articles (representing 31 unique studies/surveys) were identified. Three-quarters of the articles drew upon data from a version of the United States Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Survey Module. A range of mental health measures were used, most commonly to measure depression and depressive symptoms, but also anxiety and stress. Most research was cross-sectional and showed associations between depression and food insecurity; longitudinal analyses suggested bidirectional relationships (with food insecurity increasing the risk of depressive symptoms or diagnosis, or depression predicting food insecurity). Several articles focused on vulnerable subgroups, such as pregnant women and mothers, women at risk of homelessness, refugees, and those who had been exposed to violence or substance abuse. Overall, this review supports a link between food insecurity and mental health (and other factors, such as housing circumstances and exposure to violence) among women in high-income countries and underscores the need for comprehensive policies and programs that recognize complex links among public health challenges. © 2018 by the authors.

It has been suggested that PHWs would be more salient if placed on the waterpipe device itself. This qualitative study explored how participants perceived the effects placing PHWs on waterpipe devices would have on warning salience and uptake or quitting of WTS. Methods: We conducted 10 focus groups and 10 in-depth interviews with 90 adult waterpipe smokers and non-smokers, men and women, who lived in rural, semi-urban and urban regions of Egypt. We presented participants with four novel PHWs of different sizes positioned randomly at four locations on a waterpipe device (the glass body, metal holder, mouthpiece or hose), one at a time. At each session, participants viewed a PHW on all four locations. Novel warnings were shown on plain labels with a dark uniform background and featured pictures, text and the quitline number. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants thought placing PHWs on waterpipe devices might increase salience, prevent WTS initiation or trigger quit attempts; they favoured placing PHWs on the glass body, mouthpiece or waterpipe hose. Both waterpipe smoker and non-smoker participants thought these potential effects would affect non-smokers or non-established smokers more than established waterpipe users. Conclusions: Our exploratory study suggests that PHWs featured prominently on waterpipe devices could potentially deter experimentation with waterpipe tobacco products and promote cessation, especially among non-established users. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

The forward problem is considered that when capturing objects using a camera, light reflected off of objects at different depths will result in blurry observations in the acquired image, whereas the inverse problem seeks to estimate the depth from the knowledge of the blurry observations. In the proposed approach, a colored quasi-random point projection pattern is projected onto the scene of interest, and each projection point in the image captured by a cellphone camera is analyzed using an inverse model to estimate the depth at that point. The proposed method has a relatively simple setup, consisting of a camera and a projector, and enables depth inference from a single capture. We conclude with qualitative and quantitative results that highlight the strong potential for enabling active depth sensing in a simple, efficient manner. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Cameras; Differential equations; Image processing; Cell phone camera; Depth from defocus; Depth measurements; Inverse modeling; Inverse modelling; Novel methodology; Point projection; Quantitative result; Inverse problems,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17426588,,,,English,J.

As such, it is now possible to design and build objects or devices with complex internal structures that conform to irregular external envelopes. In applications where fluid distribution or storage is an integral part of a larger system, additive manufacturing technologies allow ""left over space"" in an overall device volume to now be effectively utilized. Herein we describe a general algorithmic framework for the construction of branched networks of tubes which occupy a specified, and possibly quite complicated, region D ? 3 as fully as possible. Such networks can be important in a variety of industrial applications ranging from heat exchangers to storage vessels to fluid distribution networks. Depending on the specific application of interest, such a design problem can be extremely ill-posed: For a given region D, our algorithm can produce an enormous number of networks, which generally requires that a much smaller number of ""best"" networks be isolated by ranking the networks based upon some problem-dependent properties (e.g., heat transfer rate, minimal friction losses, volume fraction, etc.). Some simple examples are presented to illustrate the algorithm and its output with comments added to illustrate its potential utility in industrial applications. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,3D printers; Differential equations; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Additive manufacturing technology; Algorithmic framework; Design constraints; Fluid distribution; Heat transfer rate; Internal structure; Potential utility; Traditional constructions; Inverse problems,,Institute of Physics Publishing,17426588,,,,English,J.

We aimed to determine associations between mental illness, demographic, psychosocial and economic factors with experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) among pregnant women in a low resource setting in Cape Town and to explore the contextual elements pertaining to domestic violence. Methods: We recruited adult women attending antenatal services at a primary-level maternity facility. Demographic, socioeconomic and psychosocial data were collected by questionnaire. The Expanded Mini- International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Version 5.0.0 was used to assess mental health status and the Revised Conflict Tactic Scale (CTS2) used to assess IPV in the six months prior to the study. Non-parametric tests, Wilcoxon sum of rank test, Fisher Exact and two sample T test and multicollinearity tests were performed. Descriptive, bivariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify associations between the outcome of interest and key predictors. A probability value of p ? 0.05 was selected. From counselling case notes, a thematic content analysis was conducted to describe contextual factors pertaining to forms of domestic violence (DV). Results: The prevalence of IPV was 15% of a sample of 376 women. Women who were food insecure, unemployed, in stable but unmarried relationships, had experienced any form of past abuse and were not pleased about the current pregnancy were more likely to experience IPV. MINI-defined mental health problems and a history of mental illness were significantly associated with IPV. Qualitative analysis of 95 counselling case notes revealed that DV within the household was not limited to intimate partners and, DV in this context was often perceived as 'normal' behaviour by the participants. Conclusions: This study contributes towards a greater understanding of the risk profile for IPV amongst pregnant women in low-income settings. Adversity, including food insecurity and mental ill-health are closely associated with IPV during the antenatal period. Advocates against violence against pregnant women are advised to consider that violence in the home may be perpetrated by non-intimate partners and may by enabled by a pervasive belief in the acceptability of the violence. © 2018 The Author(s).",Abuse; Antenatal; Domestic violence; Food insecurity; Intimate partner violence; Low-income setting; Mental disorders; Mixed methods; Pregnancy; South Africa,adult; Article; behavior assessment; child abuse; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; disease association; domestic violence; economic aspect; female; food insecurity; household; human; low income country; major clinical study; maternity ward; mental disease; mental health; mini international neuropsychiatric interview; partner violence; pregnant woman; prenatal care; prevalence; primary medical care; retrospective study; risk factor; single woman; social psychology; South Africa; thematic analysis; unemployment; unwanted pregnancy; domestic violence; epidemiology; human relation; partner violence; poverty; pregnancy; pregnant woman; psychological rating scale; psychology; questionnaire; sexuality; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Domestic Violence; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Intimate Partner Violence; Mental Health; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Prevalence; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Sexual Partners; South Africa; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,,BioMed Central Ltd.,14726874,,BWHMA,29973182,English,BMC Women's Health,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049523570,

Indeed, over 70% of the articles on this topic have been published in the past five years. Through the application of a stakeholder lens, this paper explores how CSR has developed within the extant literature, paying particular attention to current gaps and highlighting the contributions of the research in this special issue. This emerging research on CSR in the context of tourism and hospitality is pushing past the boundaries of early approaches to corporate sustainability by providing empirical evidence to support the importance of integrating a range of stakeholder perspectives and needs throughout the planning, implementation, and evaluation of CSR initiatives. We observe that while there is ample research on certain stakeholder groups such as management, employees, shareholders, and consumers, there is less emphasis on the role of communities and ecosystems as stakeholders and very little related to suppliers, NGOs, and government. Although tourism and hospitality firms may not be subject to the same pressures as other industries, there remain important opportunities to both document and engage these external stakeholders in the journey towards sustainability. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",accountability; corporate social responsibility; hospitality; stakeholders; sustainability; Tourism,,,Routledge,9669582,,,,English,J.

Methods: A research-grade 1060-nm OCT system with 3.5-lm axial resolution in retinal tissue and 92,000 A scan/s image acquisition rate was used in this study. DOCT and OCTA measurements were acquired both from a flow phantom and in vivo from retinal blood vessels in six male Brown Norway rats. The total retinal blood flow (TRBF) was modified from baseline to 70% and 20% of baseline by reducing the ocular perfusion pressure (OPP). The retinal blood vessel caliber (RBVC) was measured from OCTA and DOCT images. The caliber measurements were conducted by two separate graders using a custom MATLAB-based image processing algorithm. Results: The RBVC measured with OCTA and DOCT for normal blood flow rates were not significantly different (56.69 ± 12.17 and 57.17 ± 9.46 lm, P = 0.27, respectively). However, significant differences were detected when TRBF was reduced to 70% (55.69 ± 11.56 vs. 50.62 ± 8.85 lm, P < 0.01) and 20% (50.29 ± 9.29 vs. 44.88 ± 7.13 lm, P < 0.01) of baseline. Conclusions: Reduced TRBF resulted in inaccuracy of the RBVC measurements with DOCT in both the phantom and animal study. This result suggests that OCTA is a more accurate tool for RBVC evaluation when applied to retinal diseases associated with reduced TRBF, such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Translational Relevance: Results from this study are directly applicable to clinical studies of retinal blood flow measured with OCTA and DOCT. © 2018 The Authors.",Doppler optical coherence tomography; Ocular perfusion pressure; Optical coherence tomography angiography; Retinal imaging,animal experiment; Article; blood vessel diameter; comparative study; controlled study; doppler optical coherence tomography; image analysis; image processing; in vivo study; intraocular pressure; male; nonhuman; oculoplethysmography; optical coherence tomography angiography; rat; retina blood vessel,,Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.,21642591,,,,English,Translational Vis.

Methods: A retrospective chart review of all children identified with reading problems and seen by the University of Waterloo, Optometry Clinic, from September 2012 to June 2013. Results: Files of 121 children (mean age 8.6 years, range 6–14 years) were reviewed. No significant refractive error was found in 81% of children. Five and 8 children were identified as strabismic at distance and near respectively. Phoria test revealed 90% and 65% of patients had normal distance and near phoria. Near point of convergencia (NPC) was <5 cm in 68% of children, and 77% had stereoacuity of ?40 seconds of arc. More than 50% of the children had normal fusional vergence ranges except for near positive fusional vergencce (base out) break (46%). Tests for accommodation showed 91% of children were normal for binocular facility, and approximately 70% of children had an expected accuracy of accommodation. Conclusion: Findings indicate that some children with an identified reading problem also present with abnormal binocular test results compared to published normal values. Further investigation should be performed to investigate the relationship between binocular vision function and reading performance. © 2017",Binocular vision; Pediatrics; Reading difficulty; Vision and learning,"accommodation; adolescent; alexia; binocular convergence; binocular vision; child; female; human; male; Ontario; pathophysiology; physiology; prevalence; reading; refraction error; retrospective study; visual acuity; visual disorder; Accommodation, Ocular; Adolescent; Child; Convergence, Ocular; Dyslexia, Acquired; Female; Humans; Male; Ontario; Prevalence; Reading; Refractive Errors; Retrospective Studies; Vision Disorders; Vision, Binocular; Visual Acuity",,Spanish Council of Optometry,18884296,,,29174394,English; Spanish,J.

For the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), floods from the Peace and Athabasca rivers are critical for sustaining abundant shallow water habitat, but their frequency has been in decline for decades over much of its area. Here, we assess current hydrological and limnological status in the PAD by integrating spatial and temporal data. Analysis of water isotope compositions and water chemistry measured at numerous lakes across the delta shows that hydro-limnological effects of the large-scale ice-jam flood event of 2014 failed to persist beyond the early ice-free season of 2015. Isotope-inferred paleohydrological records from five hydrologically representative lakes in the PAD indicate that periodic desiccation during the Little Ice Age occurred at the most elevated basin in response to locally arid climatic conditions, yet other lower elevation sites were influenced by high water level on Lake Athabasca owing to increased snowmelt- and glacier-derived river discharge. In contrast, water isotope data during the past 15 yr at all five lakes consistently document the strong role of evaporation, a trend which began in the early to mid-20 th century according to sediment records and is indicative of widespread aridity unprecedented during the past 400 yr. We suggest that integration of hydrological and limnological approaches over space and time is needed to inform assessment of contemporary lake conditions in large, complex floodplain landscapes. © 2018 The Authors Limnology and Oceanography published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",,aridity; climate conditions; desiccation; flood; flooding; floodplain; habitat type; isotopic composition; limnology; Little Ice Age; paleohydrology; river discharge; shallow water; snowmelt; water chemistry; water level; Alberta; Canada; Peace-Athabasca Delta,,Wiley Blackwell,19395590,,LIOCA,,English,Limnol.

We first review the current status for the renormalization group equations of gauge-fermion theories and extend the results to semisimple groups. In this regime these theories develop an interacting ultraviolet fixed point that for the semisimple case leads to a rich phase diagram. The latter contains a complete asymptotically safe fixed point repulsive in all couplings. We then add two gauged Weyl fermions belonging to arbitrary representations of the semisimple gauge group and a complex, gauged scalar to the original gauge-fermion theory allowing for new Yukawa interactions and quartic scalar self-coupling. Consequently, we determine the first nontrivial order in 1/Nf for the Yukawa and quartic beta functions. Our work elucidates, consolidates, and extends results obtained earlier in the literature. We also acquire relevant knowledge about the dynamics of gauge-Yukawa theories beyond perturbation theory. Our findings are applicable to any extension of the standard model featuring a large number of fermions such as asymptotic safety. © 2018 authors.

The powder metallurgy process facilitates the use of admixed ceramic particles to produce aluminum metal matrix composites. However, fundamental data on the thermal-mechanical response of commercially relevant powder metallurgy alloy systems under varying conditions of temperature and strain rate are lacking. To address this constraint, the current study investigates the thermal-mechanical processing response of a family of metal matrix composite materials that employ a commercially exploited base alloy system coupled with admixed additions of aluminum nitride. Industrially-sintered compacts were tested under hot compression using a Gleeble 3500 thermal-mechanical test system to quantify their flow behavior. The nominal workability was assessed as a function of material formulation, sintered preform condition, and processing parameters (temperature and strain rate). Optical metallography and electron backscatter diffraction were used to observe the grain evolution through deformation. Full densification was achieved for materials with ceramic concentrations of 2% volume or less. Zener-Hollomon constituent analyses were also completed to elucidate a more comprehensive understanding the flow behavior inherent to each material. Flow behavior varied directly with the sintered density, which was influenced by the concentration and nature of ceramic particulate. © 2018 by the authors.

We consider two cases depending on whether the period of time sustained at or above level b is counted either consecutively or accumulatively (referred to as standard or cumulative waiting period). In both cases, we develop a recursive computational procedure to calculate the expected total discounted dividend payments made prior to ruin for a discrete-time Sparre Andersen renewal risk process. By varying the values of b and h, a numerical study of the trade-off effects between finite-time ruin probabilities and expected total discounted dividend payments is investigated under a variety of scenarios. Finally, a generalized threshold-based strategy with a delayed dividend payment rule is studied under the compound binomial model. © 2018 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.",Compound binomial model; Discrete-time Sparre Andersen renewal risk process; Dividend payments; Parisian-type model; Ruin probabilities; Threshold strategy; Waiting period,,,American Institute of Mathematical Sciences,15475816,,,,English,J.

Second, based on this unified probability framework, a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with some new terms was constructed. Third, with this LKF and some inequality technologies, a less conservative criterion was established, which can ensure the stochastic stability of the error system.

Methods Adult smokers from online panels in Canada (n=2357), Australia (n=1671) and Mexico (n=2537) were surveyed every 4 months from 2012 to 2013. Participants were shown PHWs on packs in their respective countries and asked about: (1) noticing PHWs; (2) negative affects towards PHWs; (3) believability of PHWs; (4) PHW-stimulated discussions; and (5) quit motivation due to PHWs. Country-specific generalised estimating equation models regressed these outcomes on time (ie, survey wave), PHW imagery type (ie, symbolic representations of risk, suffering from smoking and graphic depictions of bodily harm) and interactions between them. Results In all countries, PHW responses did not significantly change over time, except for increased noticing PHWs in Canada and Mexico, increased negative affect in Australia and decreased negative affect in Mexico. For all outcomes, symbolic PHWs were rated lower than suffering and graphic PHWs in Canada (the only country with symbolic PHWs). Graphic PHWs were rated higher than suffering PHWs for negative affect (all countries), discussions (Canada) and quit motivation (Australia). Suffering PHWs were rated higher than graphic PHWs for noticing PHWs (Canada), believability (all countries), discussions (AustraliaandMexico) and quit motivation (Mexico). Changes in noticing, believability and discussions varied somewhat by imagery type across countries. Conclusions The different PHW imagery appears to have different pathways of influence on adult smokers. Reactions to specific PHWs are similar over 1-2 years, suggesting that wear-out of PHW effects is due to decreased attention rather than the diminishing effectiveness of content. © 2018 Author(s).",communication; graphic warning; policy; tobacco control,adult; article; attention; Australia; Canada; female; human; imagery; major clinical study; male; Mexico; motivation; risk assessment; smoking,,BMJ Publishing Group,20446055,,,,English,BMJ Open,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050278216,

They have been at the forefront of the development of synthetic aperture, plane wave, shear wave elastography, and vector flow imaging. Such platforms are driven by a need for broad flexibility of parameters that are normally preset or fixed within clinical scanners. OP ultrasound scanners are defined to have three key features including customization of the transmit waveform, access to the prebeamformed receive data, and the ability to implement real-time imaging. In this paper, a formative discussion is given on the development of OPs from both the research community and the commercial sector. Both software- and hardware-based architectures are considered, and their specifications are compared in terms of resources and programmability. Software-based platforms capable of real-time beamforming generally make use of scalable graphics processing unit architectures, whereas a common feature of hardware-based platforms is the use of field-programmable gate array and digital signal processor devices to provide additional on-board processing capacity.

An investigation was conducted to determine whether contrast-balanced binocular treatment – a strategy currently being explored for children with anisometropic and strabismic amblyopia – may be effective in children with deprivation amblyopia. Methods: An unmasked, case-series design intended to assess proof of principle was employed. Eighteen children with deprivation amblyopia due to childhood cataracts (early bilateral n = 7, early unilateral n = 7, developmental n = 4), as well as 10 children with anisometropic (n = 8) or mixed anisometropic and strabismic amblyopia (n = 2) were prescribed one hour a day of treatment over a six-week period. Supervised treatment was available. Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, global motion perception and interocular suppression were measured pre- and post-treatment. Results: Visual acuity improvements occurred in the anisometropic/strabismic group (0.15 ± 0.05 logMAR, p = 0.014), but contrast sensitivity did not change. As a group, children with deprivation amblyopia had a smaller but statistically significant improvement in weaker eye visual acuity (0.09 ± 0.03 logMAR, p = 0.004), as well a significant improvement in weaker eye contrast sensitivity (p = 0.004). Subgroup analysis suggested that the children with early bilateral deprivation had the largest improvements, while children with early unilateral cataract did not improve. Interestingly, binocular contrast sensitivity also improved in children with early bilateral deprivation. Global motion perception improved for both subgroups with early visual deprivation, as well as children with anisometropic or mixed anisometropic/strabismic amblyopia. Interocular suppression improved for all subgroups except children with early unilateral deprivation. Conclusion: These data suggest that supervised contrast-balanced binocular treatment should be further investigated as a treatment option for children with deprivation amblyopia. However, for children with more severe deprivation amblyopia due to early unilateral cataracts, supplementary or alternative options should also be explored. © 2017 Optometry Australia",binocular treatment; deprivation amblyopia; paediatric cataracts,"adolescent; amblyopia; binocular vision; cataract; cataract extraction; child; complication; contrast sensitivity; follow up; human; infant; lens implantation; pathophysiology; physiology; preschool child; prospective study; pseudophakia; sensory deprivation; spectacles; visual acuity; Adolescent; Amblyopia; Cataract; Cataract Extraction; Child; Child, Preschool; Contrast Sensitivity; Eyeglasses; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant; Lens Implantation, Intraocular; Prospective Studies; Pseudophakia; Sensory Deprivation; Vision, Binocular; Visual Acuity",,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,8164622,,CEOPE,29193320,English,Clin.

This study reports on the ability of the Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) questionnaire to detect dry eye (DE) symptoms in contact lens (CL) and non-CL wearers. METHODS. The SPEED questionnaire was administered to all subjects while the Contact Lens Dry Eye Questionnaire-8 (CLDEQ-8) was only administered to CL wearers. Tear meniscus heights (TMH) were measured, and the phenol red thread (PRT) test was conducted. These tests along with self-reported DE were used to identify subjects with dry eye disease (DED). Rasch analysis was performed to evaluate the questionnaires for measurement precision and unidimensionality, and the scores from these Rasch analyses were used to understand their ability to predict measures of DED. RESULTS. We enrolled 284 subjects (150 CL and 134 non-CL wearers). Mean subject age was 39.4 ± 14.2 years. Rasch analysis yielded a multidimensional short form of the SPEED questionnaire (8-items) and a unidimensional short form of the CLDEQ-8 (4-item). Scores from both questionnaires were significantly associated with self-reported DE in CL and non-CL wearers. Scores of the 8-item SPEED questionnaire were associated with DED status in non-CL wearers but not in CL wearers while 4-item CLDEQ scores were associated with DED status in CL wearers. TMH or PRT were not associated with either questionnaire in CL or non-CL wearers. CONCLUSIONS. The 8-item SPEED questionnaire demonstrated adequate measurement precision with evidence of quantifying multiple symptoms categories while the 4-item CLDEQ-8 primarily quantified DE symptoms. Questionnaire scores were associated with self-reported DE, which suggests that they may have utility in both populations analyzed. © 2018 The Authors.",Contact lens dry eye questionnaire-8 (CLDEQ-8); Contact lenses; Dry eye disease; Rasch analysis; Standard patient evaluation of eye dryness (SPEED),adult; Article; Contact Lens Dry Eye Questionnaire 8; cross-sectional study; diagnostic test; dry eye; female; human; ligament rupture; male; measurement accuracy; meibomian gland dysfunction; phenol red thread test; priority journal; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; Rasch analysis; scoring system; Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness Questionnaire; tear meniscus height; visual system parameters; adverse device effect; chemistry; comparative study; contact lens; dry eye; lacrimal fluid; middle aged; psychometry; self report; Sickness Impact Profile; young adult; Adult; Contact Lenses; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dry Eye Syndromes; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Self Report; Sickness Impact Profile; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tears; Young Adult,,Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.,1460404,,IOVSD,30025086,English,Invest.

We aimed to compare the risk of GC among immigrants to Ontario, Canada, to the risk of GC in its general population. Methods: This was a retrospective population-based matched cohort study from 1991 to 2014. We identified immigrants who were first eligible for the Ontario Health Insurance Plan at age 40 years or older, and matched 5 controls by year of birth and sex. We calculated crude rates and relative rates of GC stratified by sex. We modeled GC hazard using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, where a time-varying coefficient was incorporated to examine changes in the association of immigrant status with GC hazard over time. Results: Among females, 415 GC cases were identified among 209,843 immigrants and 1872 among 1,049,215 controls. Among males, 596 GC cases were identified among 191,792 immigrants and 2998 among 958,960 controls. Comparing immigrants from East Asia and Pacific with the controls, the crude relative rate of GC was 1.54 for females and 1.32 for males. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for GC among female immigrants was 1.29 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12, 1.48] within 10 years and 1.19 (1.01, 1.40) beyond 10 years; for males, the HR was 1.17 (1.04, 1.31) within 10 years and 1.00 (0.87, 1.15) beyond 10 years. Conclusion: The risk of GC among immigrants is elevated. Although high-risk immigrant populations in Ontario have been identified, further knowledge is required before a program of GC prevention that is targeted to them can be planned. © 2017, The International Gastric Cancer Association and The Japanese Gastric Cancer Association.",Cox regression model with time-varying coefficient; Gastric cancer; Immigrants; Matched cohort study; Relative rate,adult; age distribution; aged; Article; cancer risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; East Asian; female; hazard ratio; high risk population; human; immigrant; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Ontario; priority journal; retrospective study; stomach cancer; case control study; Far East; migrant; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; stomach tumor; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Emigrants and Immigrants; Far East; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Risk Factors; Stomach Neoplasms,,Springer Tokyo,14363291,,GCANF,29285629,English,Gastric Cancer,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039556730,

Preexisting chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and asthma were thought to predict risk of progression to severe infections. Objective We aimed to quantify the frequency of chronic comorbidities in flavivirus diseases to provide an estimate for their prevalence in severe and non-severe infections and examine whether chronic diseases contribute to the increased risk of severe viral expression. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase and Embase Classic and grey literature databases to identify studies reporting prevalence estimates of comorbidities in flavivirus diseases. Study quality was assessed with the risk of bias tool. Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for severe infection in the presence of chronic comorbidities. Results We identified 65 studies as eligible for inclusion for DENV (47 studies) and WNV (18 studies). Obesity and overweight (i.e., BMI&gt; 25 kg/m2, prevalence: 24.5%, 95% CI: 18.6–31.6%), hypertension (17.1%, 13.3–21.8%) and diabetes (13.3%, 9.3–18.8%) were the most prevalent comorbidities in DENV. However, hypertension (45.0%, 39.1–51.0%), diabetes (24.7%, 20.2–29.8%) and heart diseases (25.6%, 19.5–32.7%) were the most prevalent in WNV. ORs of severe flavivirus diseases were about 2 to 4 in infected patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases. The small number of studies in JEV, YFV and Zika did not permit estimating the prevalence of comorbidities in these infections. Conclusion Higher prevalence of chronic comorbidities was found in severe cases of flavivirus diseases compared to non-severe cases. Findings of the present study may guide public health practitioners and clinicians to evaluate infection severity based on the presence of comorbidity, a critical public health measure that may avert severe disease outcome given the current dearth of clear prevention practices for some flavivirus diseases. © 2018 Badawi et al.

Elevated levels of vaginal inflammation has been associated with the increased risk of HIV infection as it brings highly activated HIV target cells (CCR5+CD4+ T cells; CCR5+CD4+CD161+ Th17 T cells) to the female genital tract (FGT) where they interact with HIV. Decreased HIV risk has been associated with a phenotype of decreased immune activation, called immune quiescence, described among Kenyan female sex workers who were intensely exposed to HIV yet remain uninfected. Current prevention approaches focus on limiting viral access. We took the novel HIV prevention approach of trying to limit the number of HIV target cells in the genital tract by reducing inflammation using safe, affordable and globally accessible anti-inflammatory drugs. Methods: We hypothesized that the daily administration of low doses of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA 81 mg) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ 200 mg) would reduce inflammation thereby decreasing HIV target cells at the FGT. Low-risk HIV seronegative women from Nairobi, Kenya were randomized for six weeks therapy of ASA (n = 37) or HCQ (n = 39) and tested to determine the impact on their systemic and mucosal immune environment. Results: The results showed that HCQ use was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of systemic T cells that were CCR5+CD4+ (p = 0.01) and Th17 (p = 0.01). In the ASA arm, there was a 35% and 28% decrease in the proportion of genital T cells that were CD4+CCR5+ (p = 0.017) and Th17 (p = 0.04) respectively. Proteomic analyses of the cervical lavage showed ASA use was associated with significantly reduced amount of proteins involved in the inflammatory response and cell recruitment at the mucosa, although none of the individual proteins passed multiple comparison correction. These changes were more apparent in women with Lactobacillus dominant microbiomes. Conclusion: Together, these data indicate that taking low-dose ASA daily was associated with significant reduction in HIV target cells at the FGT. This study provides proof-of-concept for a novel HIV-prevention approach that reducing inflammation using safe, affordable and globally accessible non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents is associated with significant reduction in the proportion of HIV-target cells at the FGT. © 2018 The Authors.

Elevated concentrations of nitrite have been observed in the Seine River, raising questions about its sources and fate. Here, we assess the role of bottom sediments as potential sources or sinks of nitrite along the river continuum. Sediment cores were collected from two depocenters, one located upstream, the other downstream, from the largest wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) servicing the conurbation of Paris. Pore water profiles of oxygen, nitrate, nitrite and ammonium were measured. Ammonium, nitrate and nitrite fluxes across the sediment-water interface (SWI) were determined in separate core incubation experiments. The data were interpreted with a one-dimensional, multi-component reactive transport model, which accounts for the production and consumption of nitrite through nitrification, denitrification, anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). In all core incubation experiments, nitrate uptake by the sediments was observed, indicative of high rates of denitrification. In contrast, for both sampling locations, the sediments in cores collected in August 2012 acted as sinks for nitrite, but those collected in October 2013 released nitrite to the overlying water. The model results suggest that the first step of nitrification generated most pore water nitrite at the two locations. While nitrification was also the main pathway consuming nitrite in the sediments upstream of the WWTP, anammox dominated nitrite removal at the downstream site. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the magnitude and direction of the benthic nitrite fluxes most strongly depend on bottom water oxygenation and the deposition flux of labile organic matter. © 2018 The Authors",Anammox; Benthic exchanges; Denitrification; DNRA; Nitrification; Nitrite; Reactive transport modeling; River sediments; Seine,Denitrification; Nitrates; Nitrification; Nitrogen removal; Sediments; Sensitivity analysis; Wastewater treatment; Water; ANAMMOX; DNRA; Nitrite; Reactive transport modeling; River sediments; Seine; Rivers; ammonia; nitrate; nitrite; oxygen; water; ammonium; benthos; denitrification; depocenter; diagenesis; fluvial deposit; nitrification; nitrite; nitrogen cycle; numerical model; oxygenation; reactive transport; sediment chemistry; sediment core; sediment-water interface; wastewater treatment plant; Article; benthos; chemical model; chemical sink; concentration (parameters); denitrification; diagenesis; France; mathematical model; nitrate uptake; nitrification; priority journal; river ecosystem; sediment; source sink relationship; waste water treatment plant; France; Ile de France; Paris; Seine River [France]; Ville de Paris,,Elsevier B.V.,489697,,STEVA,,English,Sci.

PROTECT Network Investigators","Worldwide, more than 230 million adults have major noncardiac surgery each year. Although surgery can improve quality and duration of life, it can also precipitate major complications. Moreover, a substantial proportion of deaths occur after discharge. Current systems for monitoring patients postoperatively, on surgical wards and after transition to home, are inadequate. On the surgical ward, vital signs evaluation usually occurs only every 4-8 hours. Reduced in-hospital ward monitoring, followed by no vital signs monitoring at home, leads to thousands of cases of undetected/delayed detection of hemodynamic compromise. In this article we review work to date on postoperative remote automated monitoring on surgical wards and strategy for advancing this field. Key considerations for overcoming current barriers to implementing remote automated monitoring in Canada are also presented. © 2018 The Authors",,"amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; ambulatory care; automation; breathing rate; Canada; core temperature; cost effectiveness analysis; economic evaluation; electrocardiogram; electronic patient record; health care cost; health care policy; heart rate; heart rate variability; home monitoring; hospital discharge; hospital information system; hospital readmission; human; hypotension; intensive care unit; Internet; machine learning; medical technology; non invasive procedure; oxygen saturation; patient monitoring; patient transport; postoperative care; postoperative complication; postoperative remote automated monitoring; program effectiveness; pulse oximetry; randomized controlled trial (topic); remote sensing; Review; risk assessment; science; skin temperature; surgical mortality; surgical patient; surgical ward; telemedicine; telemonitoring; vital sign; physiologic monitoring; physiology; postoperative care; procedures; surgery; Humans; Monitoring, Physiologic; Postoperative Care; Surgical Procedures, Operative; Telemedicine; Vital Signs",,Elsevier Inc.,0828282X,,CJCAE,29960614,English,Can.

Benefits have been identified for recreational gamblers (those experiencing no gambling-related problems), but there are many social, financial, and health harms affecting quality of life related to gambling across the spectrum of risk levels. Because of their greater numbers, low and moderate risk (LMR) older adult gamblers are responsible for higher levels of population harm. Therefore, this study examines outcomes experienced by older adults who participate in gambling at recreational and LMR levels to better understand protective factors that contribute to quality of life. Guided by activity theory and a modified self-complexity model, we explore how leisure complexity and employment buffer the relationship between gambler type and factors associated with well-being, namely social support (both perceived and received) and stress. A sub-sample of 3232 adults, age 55 years and older, who gambled in the past year was drawn from the 2013–2014 Canadian Community Health Survey. Data were analyzed using linear regression with moderation, focusing on the interactions of gambling risk level with leisure complexity and employment. Recreational gamblers reported greater role complexity and more diverse leisure lifestyles, both of which were associated with greater social support and reduced stress. Life stress was higher among older adults who worked for pay. Even so, having a job appeared to temper stress levels among LMR gamblers, suggesting the importance of maintaining a diversity of social roles and leisure activities, where possible, to enhance quality of life. © 2018 The Author(s)",Leisure complexity; Low and moderate risk gambling; Older adults; Quality of life; Social support,,,Springer Netherlands,18712584,,,,English,Appl.
